{"summary": "Tejano music or Tex-Mex music  is a genre of music that originated in South Texas with help from German settlers in the 1800s.", "full_text": "Tejano or Texano   is a term used to identify a resident of Texas of Criollo Spanish or Mexican American heritage.\nHistorically, the Spanish term Tejano has been used to identify various groups of people. During the Spanish colonial era, the term was primarily applied to Spanish settlers of the region now known as the state of Texas . After settlers entered from the United States and gained the independence of the Republic of Texas, the term was applied to Spanish-speaking Texans, Hispanicized Germans, and other Spanish-speaking residents.\nSince the early 20th century, Tejano has been more broadly used to identify a Texan Mexican American. It is also a term used to identify natives, as opposed to newcomers, in the areas settled. Hispanic people of Texas identify as Tejano if their families were living there before the area was controlled by European Americans.", "title": "Tejano"}
