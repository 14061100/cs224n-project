{"summary": "Max Born  was a German physicist and mathematician who was important in the development of quantum mechanics.", "full_text": "Ernst Pascual Jordan  was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications.\n^ McCrimmon, Kevin  A Taste of Jordan Algebras.
