{"summary": "The United States Census Bureau  is a part of the United States government that is responsible for the United States Census.", "full_text": "This is a list of agencies of the United States federal government.\nLegislative definitions of a federal agency are varied, and even contradictory, and the official United States Government Manual offers no definition. While the Administrative Procedure Act definition of \"agency\" applies to most executive branch agencies, Congress may define an agency however it chooses in enabling legislation, and subsequent litigation, often involving the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act, further cloud attempts to enumerate a list of agencies.\nThe executive branch of the federal government includes the Executive Office of the President and the United States federal executive departments . Employees of the majority of these agencies are considered civil servants.\nThe majority of the independent agencies of the United States government are also classified as executive agencies . There are a small number of independent agencies that are not considered part of the executive branch, such as the Library of Congress and Congressional Budget Office, which are administered directly by Congress and thus are legislative branch agencies. The status of these agencies is an open question, however, as Judge Brett Kavanaugh noted in a brief concurrence in SoundExchange, Inc. v. Librarian of Congress. There is one independent agency in the judicial branch.", "title": "List of United States federal agencies"}
