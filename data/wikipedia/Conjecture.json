{"summary": "A conjecture is an idea in mathematics that appears likely to be true but that has not been proven to be true.", "full_text": "In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, but for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis  or Fermat's Last Theorem  have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to solve them.", "title": "Conjecture"}
