{"summary": "Adaptive optics is a technology to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion.", "full_text": "Adaptive optics  is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of wavefront distortions: it aims at correcting the deformations of an incoming wavefront by deforming a mirror in order to compensate for the distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy, optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.\nAdaptive optics should not be confused with active optics, which works on a longer timescale to correct the primary mirror geometry.\nOther methods can achieve resolving power exceeding the limit imposed by atmospheric distortion, such as speckle imaging, aperture synthesis, and lucky imaging, or by moving outside the atmosphere with space telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.", "title": "Adaptive optics"}
