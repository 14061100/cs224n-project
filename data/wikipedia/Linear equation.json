{"summary": "In mathematics, a linear equation is a type of equation.", "full_text": "A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and  a single variable.\nLinear equations can have one or more variables. Linear equations occur abundantly in most subareas of mathematics and especially in applied mathematics. While they arise quite naturally when modeling many phenomena, they are particularly useful since many non-linear equations may be reduced to linear equations by assuming that quantities of interest vary to only a small extent from some \"background\" state. Linear equations do not include exponents.\nThis article considers the case of a single equation for which one searches the real solutions. All its content applies for complex solutions and, more generally for linear equations with coefficients and solutions in any field.", "title": "Linear equation"}
