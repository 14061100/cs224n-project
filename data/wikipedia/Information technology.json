{"summary": "Information technology  is a term that encompasses all forms of technology used to create, store, exchange, and use information in its various forms .", "full_text": "Information technology  is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise.\nThe term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, engineering, healthcare, e-commerce and computer services.\nHumans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \"the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology .\" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.\nBased on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical , mechanical , electromechanical  and electronic . This article focuses on the most recent period , which began in about 1940.", "title": "Information technology"}
