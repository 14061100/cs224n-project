{"summary": "Catholicism is the traditions and beliefs of Catholic Churches.", "full_text": "Catholicism  and its adjectival form Catholic are used as broad terms for describing specific traditions in the Christian churches in theology, doctrine, liturgy, ethics, and spirituality.\n\"Catholicism\" and \"Catholic\" in this sense refer to the practices of several Christian churches. This sense is to be distinguished from the use of these words to refer to the Roman Catholic Church, that which is in full communion with the Holy See, as well as the Orthodox Catholic Church , which also considers itself the universal and apostolic church.\nIn the sense of indicating historical continuity of faith and practice from the first millennium, the term \"catholic\" is employed by many other historic churches which claim to be \"heirs of the apostolic faith\". These consider themselves to be catholic, teaching that the term \"designates the historic, orthodox mainstream of Christianity whose doctrine was defined by the ecumenical councils and creeds\" and as such, most Reformers \"appealed to this catholic tradition and believed they were in continuity with it.\"\nWithin the Anglican Communion, the Oxford Movement promoted Anglo-Catholicism, which reemphasized the importance of doctrines such as the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and apostolic succession.\nThe Roman Catholic church teaches that Protestant churches are not in fact churches, as they do not have apostolic tradition of ordinations, and therefore, do not have valid eucharist, nor are they in full communion with the successor of saint Peter, the Pope. It does however recognise the shared apostolic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox church. Whilst it maintains that all salvation comes through the church, this leaves scope for the salvation of other Christians with an imperfect communion with the Roman Catholic church, i.e. Protestants.", "title": "Catholicism"}
