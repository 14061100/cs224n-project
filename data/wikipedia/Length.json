{"summary": "Length is a property of a thing that can be measured.", "full_text": "In geometric measurements, length is the most extended dimension of an object. In the International System of Quantities, length is any quantity with dimension distance. In other contexts \"length\" is the measured dimension of an object. For example, it is possible to cut a length of a wire which is shorter than wire thickness.\nLength may be distinguished from height, which is vertical extent, and width or breadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object at right angles to the length. Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions  and volume is a measure of three dimensions . In most systems of measurement, the unit of length is a base unit, from which other units are defined.", "title": "Length"}
