{"summary": "A ruminant is a mammal that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass.", "full_text": "Cud is a portion of food that returns from a ruminant's stomach to the mouth to be chewed for the second time. More accurately, it is a bolus of semi-degraded food regurgitated from the reticulorumen of a ruminant. Cud is produced during the physical digestive process of rumination. The idiomatic expression chewing one's cud means meditating or pondering; similar expressions such as \"he chewed that over for a bit\", or \"chew on that!\" likely have the same derivation.", "title": "Cud"}
