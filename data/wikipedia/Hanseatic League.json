{"summary": "The Hanseatic League  was an alliance of trading guilds.", "full_text": "The Hanseatic League  was a commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and their market towns. It dominated Baltic maritime trade  along the coast of Northern Europe. It stretched from the Baltic to the North Sea and inland during the Late Middle Ages and early modern period .\nThe League was created to protect economic interests and diplomatic privileges in the cities and countries and along the trade routes the merchants visited. The Hanseatic cities had their own legal system and furnished their own armies for mutual protection and aid. Despite this, the organization was not a city-state, nor can it be called a confederation of city-states; only a very small number of the cities within the league enjoyed autonomy and liberties comparable to those of a free imperial city.\nThe legacy of the Hansa is remembered today in several names, for example the German airline Lufthansa , F.C. Hansa Rostock, the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen, in the Netherlands, the Hanze oil production platform , the Hansa Brewery in Bergen, the Hansabank in the Baltic states  and the Hanse Sail in Rostock. DDG Hansa was a major German shipping company from 1881 until its bankruptcy in 1980.", "title": "Hanseatic League"}
