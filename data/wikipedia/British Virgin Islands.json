{"summary": "The British Virgin Islands are part of the Virgin Islands, which are chain of islands in the Caribbean.", "full_text": "The British Virgin Islands , officially the Virgin Islands, is a British overseas territory located in the Caribbean to the east of Puerto Rico. The islands make up part of the Virgin Islands archipelago; the remaining islands constitute the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Spanish Virgin Islands.\nThe official name of the Territory is still simply the \"Virgin Islands\", but the prefix \"British\" is often used to distinguish it from the neighbouring American territory which changed its name from the \"Danish West Indies\" to \"Virgin Islands of the United States\" in 1917. British Virgin Islands government publications continue to begin with the name \"The Territory of the Virgin Islands\", and the Territory's passports simply refer to the \"Virgin Islands\", and all laws begin with the words \"Virgin Islands\". Moreover, the Territory's Constitutional Commission has expressed the view that \"every effort should be made\", to encourage the use of the name \"Virgin Islands\".\nThe British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, and Jost Van Dyke, along with over fifty other smaller islands and cays. About 15 of the islands are inhabited. The capital, Road Town, is situated on Tortola, the largest island, which is approximately 20 km  long and 5 km  wide. The islands have a population of about 28,000, of whom approximately 23,500 live on Tortola.\nBritish Virgin Islanders are classed as British Overseas Territories citizens and since 2002 have had an entitlement to take up full UK citizenship. Although the territory is not part of the European Union and not directly subject to EU law, its citizens are deemed to be citizens of the EU as well.\n\n", "title": "British Virgin Islands"}
