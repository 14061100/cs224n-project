{"summary": "A pathogen is an infectious thing, such as a virus, bacteria, fungi or parasite, which causes a disease.", "full_text": "In biology, a pathogen  in the oldest and broadest sense is anything that can produce disease, a term which came into use in the 1880s. Typically the term is used to describe an infectious agent such as a virus, bacterium, prion, fungus, viroid, or parasite that causes disease in its host. The host may be an animal, a plant, a fungus, or even another micro-organism.\nThere are several substrates including pathways where the pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but soil contamination has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases caused by organisms in humans are known as pathogenic diseases.", "title": "Pathogen"}
