Written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller, the film is about a Saxon knight who, in King Richard's absence in the Holy Land during the Crusades, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The Adventures of Robin Hood was filmed in Technicolor.\nIn 1995, The Adventures of Robin Hood was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. It is considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made.\nThe honor of being Warner Bros. first three-strip Technicolor release actually goes to Gold Is Where You Find It , which went into production and was released several months earlier than The Adventures of Robin Hood. Alan Hale, Sr., who plays Little John, had played the same character in the 1922 version of the film and went on to play him again in Rogues of Sherwood Forest, released by Columbia in 1950.\n^ a b Glancy, H.
