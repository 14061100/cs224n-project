{"summary": "The Great Seal of United States is the official coat of arms of United States, and it is placed in official documents from United States Government.", "full_text": "The Great Seal of the United States is used to authenticate certain documents issued by the U.S. federal government. The phrase is used both for the physical seal itself , and more generally for the design impressed upon it. The Great Seal was first used publicly in 1782.\nThe obverse of the great seal is used as the national coat of arms of the United States. It is officially used on documents such as United States passports, military insignia, embassy placards, and various flags. As a coat of arms, the design has official colors; the physical Great Seal itself, as affixed to paper, is monochrome.\nSince 1935, both sides of the Great Seal have appeared on the reverse of the one-dollar bill. The Seal of the President of the United States is directly based on the Great Seal, and its elements are used in numerous government agency and state seals.", "title": "Great Seal of the United States"}
