He was the voice of the WWF during the 80s and early 90s and also called the first 8 WrestleManias and was the host of WrestleMania IX. He became on-screen WWF President in the latter decade.\nIn professional wrestling, the staging area just behind the entrance curtain at an event, a position which Marella established and where he could often be found during WWF shows late in his career, is named the Gorilla Position in his honor. Although remembered fondly by many viewers, Monsoon was disliked by \"smart\" fans; he was voted \"Worst Television Announcer\" a record six times by readers of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.\n\n", "title": "Gorilla Monsoon"}
