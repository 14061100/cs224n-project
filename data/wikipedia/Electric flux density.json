{"summary": "In the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell published equations that describe how charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic force per unit charge.", "full_text": "In physics, the electric displacement field, denoted by D, is a vector field that appears in Maxwell's equations. It accounts for the effects of free and bound charge within materials. \"D\" stands for \"displacement\", as in the related concept of displacement current in dielectrics. In free space, the electric displacement field is equivalent to flux density, a concept that lends understanding to Gauss's law. It has the SI units of coulomb per squared metre .", "title": "Electric flux density"}
