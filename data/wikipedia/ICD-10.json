{"summary": "The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision  is list of codes that classify diseases and medical problems.", "full_text": "ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , a medical classification list by the World Health Organization . It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.\nThe code set allows more than 14,400 different codes and permits the tracking of many new diagnoses. The codes can be expanded to over 16,000 codes by using optional sub-classifications. The detail reported by ICD can be further increased, with a simplified multi-axial approach, by using codes meant to be reported in a separate data field.\nThe WHO provides detailed information about ICD online, and makes available a set of materials online, such as an ICD-10 online browser, ICD-10 Training, ICD-10 online training, ICD-10 online training support, and study guide materials for download.\nThe International version of ICD should not be confused with national Clinical Modifications  of ICD that frequently include much more detail, and sometimes have separate sections for procedures. The US ICD-10 Clinical Modification , for instance, has some 68,000 codes. The US also has the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System , a coding system that contains 76,000 codes not used by other countries.\nWork on ICD-10 began in 1983 and was completed in 1992.", "title": "ICD-10"}
