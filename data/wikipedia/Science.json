{"summary": "Science is what we do to find out about the natural world.", "full_text": "Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the Universe. In an older and closely related meaning, \"science\" also refers to this body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied.\nContemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations. Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.\nFrom classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now and, in fact, in the West the term \"natural philosophy\" encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science such as physics, astronomy, medicine, among many others.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was in the 19th century that modern scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology reached their modern shapes. The same time period also included the origin of the terms \"scientist\" and \"scientific community,\" the founding of scientific institutions, and increasing significance of the interactions with society and other aspects of culture.\n\n", "title": "Science"}
