{"summary": "Franz Kafka  was a Czech-born, German-speaking writer.", "full_text": "Franz Kafka  was a German-language writer of novels and short stories, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th century literature. His work, which fused elements of realism and the fantastic, typically featured isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-bureaucratic powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity. His best known works include \"Die Verwandlung\" , Der Process , and Das Schloss . The term Kafkaesque has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.\nKafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education he obtained employment with an insurance company while writing in his spare time; for the rest of his life would complain about the little time he had to devote to his passion due to the demands of his Brotberuf . Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formative relationship. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from tuberculosis.\nFew of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections Betrachtung  and Ein Landarzt , and individual stories  were published in literary magazines but received little public attention. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels Der Process, Das Schloss and Amerika , were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend Max Brod, who nonetheless ignored his friend's direction and published them after Kafka's death.\n\n", "title": "Franz Kafka"}
