{"summary": "The electromagnetic  spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation.", "full_text": "The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. The \"electromagnetic spectrum\" of an object has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.\nThe electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short-wavelength  end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom. The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length. Until the middle of last century it was believed by most physicists that this spectrum was infinite and continuous.\nMost parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions, as ways to study and characterize matter. In addition, radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing .", "title": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}
