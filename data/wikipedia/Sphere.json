{"summary": "A sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball.", "full_text": "A sphere  is a perfectly round geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a completely round ball, . Like a circle, which geometrically is a two-dimensional object, a sphere is defined mathematically as the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point, but in three-dimensional space. This distance r is the radius of the ball, and the given point is the center of the mathematical ball. The longest straight line through the ball, connecting two points of the sphere, passes through the center and its length is thus twice the radius; it is a diameter of the ball.\nWhile outside mathematics the terms \"sphere\" and \"ball\" are sometimes used interchangeably, in mathematics a distinction is made between the sphere  and the ball . The ball and the sphere share the same radius, diameter, and center.", "title": "Sphere"}
