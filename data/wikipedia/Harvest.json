{"summary": "Harvest means to collect what has been planted and grown in the ground.", "full_text": "Harvest is the process of gathering ripe crops from the fields. Reaping is the cutting of grain or pulse for harvest, typically using a scythe, sickle, or reaper. The harvest marks the end of the growing season, or the growing cycle for a particular crop, and social importance of this event makes it the focus of seasonal celebrations such as a harvest festival, found in many religions. On smaller farms with minimal mechanization harvesting is the most labor-intensive activity of the growing season. On large mechanized farms harvesting utilizes the most expensive and sophisticated farm machinery, such as the combine harvester. Harvesting in general usage may include immediate post-harvest handling, including cooling, sorting, cleaning and packing.", "title": "Harvest"}
