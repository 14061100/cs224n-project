{"summary": "Causality is a way to describe how different events relate to one another.", "full_text": "Causality  is the relation between one process  and another , where the first is understood to be partly responsible for the second. In general, a process has many causes, which are said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past. An effect can in turn be a cause of many other effects, which all lie in its future.\nIn Aristotelian philosophy, the word 'cause' is also used to mean 'explanation' or 'answer to a why question', including Aristotle's material, formal, efficient, and final \"causes\"; then the \"cause\" is the explanans for the explanandum. In this case, failure to recognize that different kinds of \"cause\" are being considered can lead to futile debate. The present article is about Aristotle's efficient \"cause\".\nThe topic remains a staple in contemporary philosophy.", "title": "Causality"}
