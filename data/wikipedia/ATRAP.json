{"summary": "An atlas is a collection of maps or manifolds, traditionally bound into book form, but also found in multimedia formats.", "full_text": "An atlas is a collection of maps; it is typically a map of Earth or a region of Earth, but there are atlases of the other planets  in the Solar System. Furthermore, atlases of anatomy exist, mapping out the human body or other organisms. Atlases have traditionally been bound into book form, but today many atlases are in multimedia formats. In addition to presenting geographic features and political boundaries, many atlases often feature geopolitical, social, religious and economic statistics. They also have information about the map and places in it.", "title": "ATRAP"}
