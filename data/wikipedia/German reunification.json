{"summary": "German reunification  is a term of history.", "full_text": "The German reunification  was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic  joined the Federal Republic of Germany  to form the reunited nation of Germany, and when Berlin reunited into a single city, as provided by its then Grundgesetz constitution Article 23. The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity , celebrated on 3 October  .\nThe East German regime started to falter in May 1989, when the removal of Hungary's border fence opened a hole in the Iron Curtain. It caused an exodus of thousands of East Germans fleeing to West Germany and Austria via Hungary. The Peaceful Revolution, a series of protests by East Germans, led to the GDR's first free elections on 18 March 1990, and to the negotiations between the GDR and FRG that culminated in a Unification Treaty. Other negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called \"Two Plus Four Treaty\"  granting full sovereignty to a unified German state, whose two parts had previously still been bound by a number of limitations stemming from their post-World War II status as occupied regions.\nThe united Germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic and not a successor state. As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in international organizations including the European Community  and NATO, while relinquishing membership in the Warsaw Pact and other international organizations to which only East Germany belonged.", "title": "German reunification"}
