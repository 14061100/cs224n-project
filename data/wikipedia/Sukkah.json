For the tractate of the Talmud, see Sukkah .\n\nA sukkah  is a temporary hut constructed for use during the week-long Jewish festival of Sukkot. It is topped with branches and often well decorated with autumnal, harvest or Judaic themes. The Book of Vayikra  describes it as a symbolic wilderness shelter, commemorating the time God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness they inhabited after they were freed from slavery in Egypt. It is common for Jews to eat, sleep and otherwise spend time in the sukkah. In Judaism, Sukkot is considered a joyous occasion and is referred to in Hebrew as Yom Simchateinu  or Z'man Simchateinu , and the sukkah itself symbolizes the frailty and transience of life and its dependence on God.", "title": "Sukkah"}
