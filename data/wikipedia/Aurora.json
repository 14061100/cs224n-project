{"summary": "An aurora is a flickering light mostly caused by the sun's radiation, usually found near the poles.", "full_text": "An aurora, sometimes referred to as a polar light, is a natural light display in the sky, predominantly seen in the high latitude  regions. Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere , where their energy is lost. The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.\nPrecipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.  Different aspects of an aurora are elaborated in various sections below.\n^ \"University of Minnesota Style Manual\". .umn.edu. 18 July 2007.
