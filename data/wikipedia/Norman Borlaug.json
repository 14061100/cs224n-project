{"summary": "Norman Borlaug  was an American scientist.", "full_text": "Norman Ernest Borlaug  was an American biologist, humanitarian and Nobel laureate who has been called \"the father of the Green Revolution\", \"agriculture's greatest spokesperson\" and \"The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives\". He is one of seven people to have won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal and was also awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honor.\nBorlaug received his B.Sc. Biology in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.\nDuring the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations. These collective increases in yield have been labeled the Green Revolution, and Borlaug is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.\nLater in his life, he helped applying these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.", "title": "Norman Borlaug"}
