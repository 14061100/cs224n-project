Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the situation, although in some situations, mitigation may not be possible and agencies may only be able to offer palliative care for the aftermath.\nWhile some emergencies are self-evident , many smaller incidents require that an observer  decide whether it qualifies as an emergency. The precise definition of an emergency, the agencies involved and the procedures used, vary by jurisdiction, and this is usually set by the government, whose agencies  are responsible for emergency planning and management.", "title": "Emergency"}
