{"summary": "The Central Time Zone subtracts six hours from UTC during standard time  and five hours during daylight saving time .", "full_text": "Time in the United States, by law, is divided into nine standard time zones covering the states and its possessions, with most of the United States observing daylight saving time for approximately the spring, summer, and fall months. The time zone boundaries and DST observance are regulated by the Department of Transportation. Official and highly precise timekeeping services  are provided by two federal agencies: the National Institute of Standards and Technology  ; and its military counterpart, the United States Naval Observatory . The clocks run by these services are kept synchronized with each other as well as with those of other international timekeeping organizations.\nIt is the combination of the time zone and daylight saving rules, along with the timekeeping services, which determines the legal civil time for any U.S. location at any moment.", "title": "Time in the United States"}
