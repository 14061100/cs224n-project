{"summary": "A sundial shows the current solar time during the day.", "full_text": "A sundial is a device that tells the time of day by the apparent position of the Sun in the sky. In the narrowest sense of the word it will consists of a flat plate, the dial and a gnomon which will throw a shadow onto the surface; lines marked onto the surface will indicate the time of day. The style is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or nodus may be used. As the sun appears to move across the sky, the shadow-edge aligns with different hour-lines. The gnomon may be a thin rod, a wire or an elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the Earth's rotation to remain accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from the horizontal is equal the sundial's geographical latitude.\nIn a broader sense a sundial is any device that uses the sun's altitude or azimuth to show the time. It is common for inexpensive mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrect hour angles, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.Sundials are valued as decorative objects, as literary metaphors and as object of mathematical study.", "title": "Sundial"}
