{"summary": "Partial Differential equations are a kind of mathematical equation.", "full_text": "In mathematics, a partial differential equation  is a differential equation that contains unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives.  PDEs are used to formulate problems involving functions of several variables, and are either solved by hand, or used to create a relevant computer model.\nPDEs can be used to describe a wide variety of phenomena such as sound, heat, electrostatics, electrodynamics, fluid flow, elasticity, or quantum mechanics. These seemingly distinct physical phenomena can be formalised similarly in terms of PDEs. Just as ordinary differential equations often model one-dimensional dynamical systems, partial differential equations often model multidimensional systems. PDEs find their generalisation in stochastic partial differential equations.", "title": "Partial differential equation"}
