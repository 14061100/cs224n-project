{"summary": "Kenneth Geddes Wilson  was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.", "full_text": "Stephen Hart Shenker  is an American theoretical physicist who works on string theory. He is a professor at Stanford University and former director of the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Physics. His brother Scott Shenker is a computer scientist. His contributions to physics include:\nBasic results on the phase structure of gauge theories \nBasic results on two dimensional conformal field theory and its relation to string theory \nThe nonperturbative formulation of matrix models of low-dimensional string theory, the first nonperturbative definitions of string theory \nThe discovery of distinctively stringy nonperturbative effects in string theory, later understood to be caused by D-branes. These effects play a major role in string dynamics\nThe discovery of Matrix Theory, the first nonperturbative definition of String/M theory in a physical number of dimensions. Matrix Theory  is an example of a gauge/gravity duality and is now understood to be a special case of the AdS/CFT correspondence \nThe discovery of the first distinct signature of the black hole singularity in AdS/CFT ", "title": "Steve Shenker"}
