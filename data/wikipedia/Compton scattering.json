{"summary": "In physics, Compton scattering, or the Compton effect, is the name used for what happens to the energy  of an X-ray or gamma ray photon when it interacts with matter; the wavelength increases  as it scatters off electrons.", "full_text": "Compton scattering is the inelastic scattering of a photon by a charged particle, usually an electron. It results in a decrease in energy  of the photon , called the Compton effect. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. Inverse Compton scattering exists, in which a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.", "title": "Compton scattering"}
