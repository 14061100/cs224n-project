{"summary": "Quantum mechanics  is the part of physics that tells us how the things that make up atoms work.", "full_text": "Quantum mechanics  including quantum field theory, is a fundamental branch of physics concerned with processes involving, for example, atoms and photons. In such processes, said to be quantized, the action has been observed to be only in integer multiples of the Planck constant, a physical quantity that is exceedingly, indeed perhaps ultimately, small. This is utterly inexplicable in classical physics.\nQuantum mechanics gradually arose from Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem  and Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric effect . Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated in the mid-1920s.\nThe mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A mathematical function, the wave function, provides information about the probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.\nImportant applications of quantum mechanical theory include superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy, and explanations for many biological and physical phenomena.\n\n", "title": "Quantum physics"}
