Members of the party were unofficially known as Tories.\nThe party began as the Conservative Party of Canada in 1867, becoming Canada's first governing party under Sir John A. Macdonald, and for years was either the governing party of Canada or the largest opposition party. The party changed its name to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in December 1942. In 2003, the party membership voted to dissolve the party and merge with the Canadian Alliance to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.\nOne member of the Senate of Canada, Elaine McCoy, opposed the merger and now sits as an \"Independent Progressive Conservative\". The conservative parties in most Canadian provinces still use the Progressive Conservative name. Some PC Party members formed the Progressive Canadian Party, which has attracted only marginal support.", "title": "Progressive Conservative Party of Canada"}
