{"summary": "Christian symbolism gives objects or actions a meaning that shows Christian ideas.", "full_text": "This article is about symbolism in religion. See religious symbols for graphical symbols. See United States Department of Veterans Affairs emblems for headstones and markers for such symbols as used by that organization.\nReligious symbolism provides an additional means to communicate the underlying message of a religion via symbols, apart from communication by words. Jesus in Mathew 13:13 says, \"The reason I use parables in talking to them is that they look, but do not see, and they listen, but do not hear or understand.\" Symbolism, like parables, clarifies a message to make its meaning more accessible to the mind. It is the use of symbols, including archetypes, acts, artwork, events, or natural phenomena, by a religion. Religions view religious texts, rituals, and works of art as symbols of compelling ideas or ideals. Symbols help create a resonant mythos expressing the moral values of the society or the teachings of the religion.\n\n", "title": "Religious symbolism"}
