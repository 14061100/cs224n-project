{"summary": "Air Berlin is the second biggest airline in Germany.", "full_text": "As a densely populated country in a central location in Europe and with a developed economy, Germany has a dense and modern transport infrastructure.\nThe first highway system to have been built, the extensive German Autobahn network famously has no general speed limit for light vehicles . The country's most important waterway is the river Rhine. The largest port is that of Hamburg. Frankfurt Airport is a major international airport and European transportation hub. Air travel is used for greater distances within Germany but faces competition from the state-owned Deutsche Bahn's rail network. High-speed trains called ICE connect cities for passenger travel with speeds up to 300 km/h. Many German cities have rapid transit systems and public transport is available in most areas.\nSince German reunification substantial efforts have been necessary to improve and expand the transportation infrastructure in what had previously been East Germany.\n\n", "title": "Transport in Germany"}
