{"summary": "A castrato  was a type of male singer with a very high voice.", "full_text": "A castrato  is a type of classical male singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. The voice is produced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.\nCastration before puberty  prevents a boy's larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. As a result, the vocal range of prepubescence  is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870.\nAs the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses  did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their ribs. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled lung-power and breath capacity. Operating through small, child-sized vocal cords, their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice. Their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult male . Listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato , one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a \"super-high\" tenor, with a more falsetto-like upper register above that.\nCastrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the euphemism musico  was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications; Another synonym was evirato, literally meaning \"emasculated\". Eunuch is a more general term, since historically many eunuchs were castrated after puberty and thus the castration had no impact on their voices.\n\n", "title": "Castrato"}
