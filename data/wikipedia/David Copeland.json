{"summary": "1999  was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "David Copeland  is an English Neo-Nazi militant who became known as the \"London Nail Bomber\" after a 13-day bombing campaign in April 1999 aimed at London's black, South Asian and gay communities that resulted in three people killed and more than a hundred injured. Widely labelled a terrorist, Copeland was a former member of two far-right political groups, the British National Party and then the National Socialist Movement.\nOver three successive weekends between 17 and 30 April 1999, Copeland placed homemade nail bombs, each containing up to 1,500 four-inch nails, in holdalls that he left in public spaces around London. The first bomb was placed outside the Iceland supermarket in Electric Avenue, Brixton, an area of south London with a large black population. The second was in Brick Lane in the East End of London, which has a large Bangladeshi community. The third was inside the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho's Old Compton Street, the heart of London's gay community. The bombs killed three people, including a pregnant woman, and injured 140, four of whom lost limbs.\nCopeland was diagnosed by five psychiatrists as having paranoid schizophrenia, while one diagnosed a personality disorder not serious enough to avoid a charge of murder. His plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was not accepted by the prosecution or jury. He was convicted of murder on 30 June 2000, and given six concurrent life sentences. In 2007 the High Court ruled that he must serve at least 50 years. He appealed the ruling, which the Court of Appeal upheld in 2011.", "title": "David Copeland"}
