{"summary": "X-ray crystallography is a way to see the three-dimensional structure of a molecule.", "full_text": "In physics, Bragg's law  gives the angles for coherent and incoherent scattering from a crystal lattice. When X-rays are incident on an atom, they make the electronic cloud move as does any electromagnetic wave. The movement of these charges re-radiates waves with the same frequency, blurred slightly due to a variety of effects; this phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering . The scattered waves can themselves be scattered but this secondary scattering is assumed to be negligible.\nA similar process occurs upon scattering neutron waves from the nuclei or by a coherent spin interaction with an unpaired electron. These re-emitted wave fields interfere with each other either constructively or destructively , producing a diffraction pattern on a detector or film. The resulting wave interference pattern is the basis of diffraction analysis. This analysis is called Bragg diffraction.\n\n", "title": "Bragg's Law"}
