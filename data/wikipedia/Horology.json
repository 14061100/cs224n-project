{"summary": "A homologous trait is any characteristic which is derived by evolution from a common ancestor.", "full_text": "Horology  is the art or science of measuring time. Clocks, watches, clockwork, sundials, hourglasses, clepsydras, timers, time recorders, marine chronometers, and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time. In current usage, horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices, while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping.\nPeople interested in horology are called horologists. That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus , as well as aficionados and scholars of horology. Horology and horologists have numerous organizations, both professional associations and more scholarly societies.", "title": "Horology"}
