{"summary": "Alberta is a province in Canada.", "full_text": "Alberta  is a western province of Canada. With a population of 3,645,257 in 2011 and an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Alberta and its neighbour, Saskatchewan, were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The current premier of the province is Rachel Notley.\nIt is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories to the north, and the US state of Montana to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single US state and is also one of only two provinces that are landlocked. The climate of the province is predominantly humid continental, but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east, with winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming which moderates average temperatures.\nEdmonton, the capital city of Alberta, is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil, oil sands  and other northern resource industries. Approximately 290 km  south of the capital is Calgary, Alberta's largest city. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two census metropolitan areas, both of which have populations exceeding one million, while the province has 16 census agglomerations. Tourist destinations in the province include Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper and Sylvan Lake.\n\n", "title": "Alberta"}
