{"summary": "The performing arts are those forms of art in which individual people perform separately or together.", "full_text": "Education in the performing arts is a key part of many primary and secondary education curricula and is also available as a specialisation at the tertiary level. The performing arts, broadly dance, music and theatre are key elements of culture and engage participants at a number of levels. This engagement through participation and formal and informal education is often lifelong.\nThe end point for performing arts education varies, for some people it is part of their engagement in their own and others culture, such as that of indigenous peoples and folklore, for others it leads to professional careers up to an elite level.\nFor this latter group, depending on the discipline, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential. This is seen particularly with classical ballet and circus arts.\nPerforming arts are often a core curriculum area in education and seeks to expose students to ways to \"express ideas and emotions that they cannot express in language alone\". The curriculum needs to be sequential, from preschool to high school, to develop \"student\" skills and understanding of creating, performing, and responding\", to \"promotes knowledge and understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of the arts\" and provide opportunities for students to make connections among the arts, with other disciplines within the core curriculum, and with arts resources in the community,and so on", "title": "Performing arts education"}
