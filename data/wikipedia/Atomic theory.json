{"summary": "In chemistry and physics, the atomic theory explains how our understanding of the atom has changed over time.", "full_text": "In chemistry and physics, atomic theory is a scientific theory of the nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.\nThe word atom comes from the Ancient Greek adjective atomos, meaning \"uncuttable\". 19th century chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of irreducible chemical elements. While seemingly apropos, around the turn of the 20th century, through various experiments with electromagnetism and radioactivity, physicists discovered that the so-called \"uncuttable atom\" was actually a conglomerate of various subatomic particles  which can exist separately from each other. In fact, in certain extreme environments, such as neutron stars, extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all. Since atoms were found to be divisible, physicists later invented the term \"elementary particles\" to describe the \"uncuttable\", though not indestructible, parts of an atom. The field of science which studies subatomic particles is particle physics, and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.\n\n", "title": "Atomic theory"}
