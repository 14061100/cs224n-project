{"summary": "Space Invaders is a video game made by the Taito Corporation.", "full_text": "Space Invaders  is an arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game, Nishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development tools.\nIt was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry . When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.\nThe game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous platforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled the system's sales and became the first \"killer app\" for video game consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often used as a synecdoche representing video games as a whole.\n^ a b Space Invaders  at the Arcade History database\n^ a b European releases:\nhttp://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=3306\nhttp://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=3887\nhttp://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5738\n\n^ a b Space Invaders , The Arcade Flyer Archive\n^ \n^ Space Invaders  at the Arcade History database\n^ \n^ a b c Taito 8080 Based Hardware, System 16: The Arcade Museum\n^ Space Invaders at the Arcade History database\n^ 8080bw, MAME", "title": "Space Invaders"}
