The band was formed after Patrick desired to start his own band after leaving Nine Inch Nails as their touring guitarist. Their debut album, Short Bus, was released in 1995, and ended up going platinum, selling over one million copies, largely due to the success of the band's single \"Hey Man Nice Shot.\" After the album, the band would go through the first of many line-up changes, leaving Patrick as the only consistent member across all music releases.\nPatrick released the band's follow up album, Title of Record, which also went platinum, off the success of the song \"Take a Picture\", in 1999, and a third album, The Amalgamut, in 2002, before checking into rehab after years of heavy alcohol and drug abuse. The band went into hiatus while Patrick went to rehab, and then formed a new band, Army of Anyone, which released one self-title album. Filter reformed in 2008 to release Anthems for the Damned, and then The Trouble with Angels in 2010, with Patrick and a revolving door of other musicians. Filter's sixth and most recent studio album, The Sun Comes Out Tonight, was released in 2013. A seventh studio album in scheduled for release in 2016.", "title": "Filter (band)"}
