{"summary": "Aryan is the name that an ancient people of Europe, Iran  and India called themselves.", "full_text": "\"Aryan\"  is a term meaning \"noble\" which was used as a self-designation by ancient Indo-Iranian peoples. The word was used ins by the Indic peoples of the Vedic period in India to refer to the noble class. The closely related Iranian peoples used the term as an ethnic label for themselves in the Avesta scriptures, and the word forms the etymological source of the country Iran. It was believed in the 19th century that it was also a self-designation used by all Proto-Indo-Europeans, a theory that has now been abandoned. Scholars point out that, even in ancient times, the idea of being an \"Aryan\" was religious, cultural and linguistic, not racial.\nDrawing on misinterpreted references in the Rig Veda by Western Scholars in the 19th century, the term \"Aryan\" was adopted as a racial category through the work of Arthur de Gobineau, whose ideology of race was based on an idea of blonde northern European \"Aryans\" who had migrated across the world and founded all major civilizations, before being degraded through racial mixture with local populations. Through Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Gobineau's ideas later influenced the Nazi racial ideology, which also saw \"Aryan peoples\" as innately superior to other putative racial groups. The atrocities committed in the name of this racial aryanism caused the term to be abandoned by most academics; and, in present-day academia, the term \"Aryan\" has been replaced in most cases by the terms \"Indo-Iranian\" and \"Indo-European\", and \"Aryan\" is now mostly limited to its appearance in the term of the \"Indo-Aryan languages\".", "title": "Aryan"}
