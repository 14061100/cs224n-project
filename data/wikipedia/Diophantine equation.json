{"summary": "A Diophantine equation is an equation that only takes integer coefficients, and that can be written as , where f is a polynomial.", "full_text": "In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are sought or studied . A linear Diophantine equation is an equation between two sums of monomials of degree zero or one. An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which exponents on terms can be unknowns.\nDiophantine problems have fewer equations than unknown variables and involve finding integers that work correctly for all equations. In more technical language, they define an algebraic curve, algebraic surface, or more general object, and ask about the lattice points on it.\nThe word Diophantine refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria, who made a study of such equations and was one of the first mathematicians to introduce symbolism into algebra. The mathematical study of Diophantine problems that Diophantus initiated is now called Diophantine analysis.\nWhile individual equations present a kind of puzzle and have been considered throughout history, the formulation of general theories of Diophantine equations  was an achievement of the twentieth century.", "title": "Diophantine equation"}
