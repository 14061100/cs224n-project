Its philosophical position is one of scientific skepticism. CSI's fellows have included notable scientists, Nobel laureates, philosophers, psychologists, educators and authors. It is headquartered in Amherst, New York.\n^ \"CSICOP website\". CSICOP. Retrieved 2006-06-21.  Statement from the heading of the website.\n^ Kurtz, Paul. . Skepticism and the Paranormal.
