{"summary": "In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically.", "full_text": "An interpretation of quantum mechanics is a set of statements which attempt to explain quantum mechanics beyond existing theory. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and thorough experimental testing, many of these experiments are open to different interpretations. There exist a number of contending schools of thought, differing over whether quantum mechanics can be understood to be deterministic, which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered \"real\", and other matters.\nThis question is of special interest to philosophers of physics, as physicists continue to show a strong interest in the subject. They usually consider an interpretation of quantum mechanics as an interpretation of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, specifying the physical meaning of the mathematical entities of the theory.", "title": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics"}
