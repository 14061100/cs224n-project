{"summary": "Washington's Birthday, also known as Presidents' Day, is a United States Federal holiday to celebrate the birth of George Washington.", "full_text": "Washington's Birthday is a United States federal holiday celebrated on the third Monday of February in honor of George Washington, the first President of the United States. Colloquially, it is widely known as Presidents Day and is often an occasion to remember all the presidents, not just George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday is also in February. The term \"Presidents Day\" was coined in a deliberate attempt to change the holiday into one honoring multiple presidents.\nThe day is also a state holiday in most states with official names including Presidents' Day, President's Day and Washington's and Lincoln's Birthday. Depending upon the specific law, the state holiday might celebrate officially Washington alone, Washington and Lincoln, or some other combination of U.S. presidents. Some states celebrate Washington and the third president Thomas Jefferson but not Lincoln.", "title": "Washington's Birthday"}
