{"summary": "In economics, the gross domestic product  is how much a place produces in some amount of time.", "full_text": "Gross national product  is the market value of all the products and services produced in one year by labour and property supplied by the residents of a country. Unlike gross domestic product , which defines production based on the geographical location of production, GNP allocates production based on location of ownership and also \"Gross National Product  is an economic statistic that includes GDP, plus any income earned by residents from overseas investments, minus income earned within the domestic economy by overseas residents.\"\nGNP does not distinguish between qualitative improvements in the state of the technical arts , and quantitative increases in goods , and considers both to be forms of \"economic growth\".\nWhen a country's capital or labour resources are employed outside its borders, or when a foreign firm is operating in its territory, GDP and GNP can produce different measures of total output. In 2009 for instance, the United States estimated its GDP at $14.119 trillion, and its GNP at $14.265 trillion.", "title": "Gross national product"}
