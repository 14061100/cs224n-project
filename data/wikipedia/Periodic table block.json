{"summary": "A block in the periodic table is an area of chemical elements that has the same electron arrangement.", "full_text": "A block of the periodic table of elements is a set of adjacent groups. The term appears to have been first used by Charles Janet. The respective highest-energy electrons in each element in a block belong to the same atomic orbital type. Each block is named after its characteristic orbital; thus, the blocks are:\ns-block\np-block\nd-block\nf-block\ng-block \nThe block names  are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the associated atomic orbitals: sharp, principal, diffuse and fundamental, and then g which follows f in the alphabet.\nThe following is the order for filling the \"subshell\" orbitals, according to the Aufbau principle, which also gives the linear order of the \"blocks\"  in the periodic table:\n1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, ...\nFor discussion of the nature of why the energies of the blocks naturally appear in this order in complex atoms, see atomic orbital and electron configuration.\nThe \"periodic\" nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the s, p, d and f \"blocks\" is more obvious, if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows  in the matrix. Then, each subshell  is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:", "title": "Periodic table block"}
