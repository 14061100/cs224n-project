{"summary": "Praseodymium is a chemical element that has the symbol Pr on the periodic table.", "full_text": "Praseodymium is a chemical element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal in the lanthanide group. It is valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found in native form, and when artificially prepared, it slowly develops a green oxide coating.\nThe element was named for the color of its primary oxide. In 1841, Swedish chemist Carl Gustav Mosander extracted a rare earth oxide residue he called \"didymium\" from a residue he called \"lantana\", in turn separated from cerium salts. In 1885, the Austrian chemist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach separated didymium into two salts of different colors, which he named praseodymium and neodymium. The name praseodymium comes from the Greek prasinos , meaning \"green\", and didymos , \"twin\".\nLike most rare earth elements, praseodymium most readily forms trivalent Pr ions. These are yellow-green in water solution, and various shades of yellow-green when incorporated into glasses. Many of praseodymium's industrial uses involve its use to filter yellow light from light sources.\n^ \"praseodymium\". Oxford English Dictionary . Oxford University Press.
