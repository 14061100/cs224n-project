{"summary": "Thyroid cancer is cancer in the thyroid gland.", "full_text": "Thyroid cancer is a cancer originating from follicular or parafollicular thyroid cells. These cells give rise to both well-differentiated cancers  and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The second cell type, the C or parafollicular cell, produces the hormone calcitonin and is the cell of origin for medullary thyroid carcinoma .\nThe most effective management of aggressive thyroid cancers is surgical removal of thyroid gland  followed by radioactive iodine ablation and TSH-suppression therapy. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also be used in cases of distant metastases or advanced cancer stage. Five year survival rates are 97.8% in the United States.", "title": "Thyroid cancer"}
