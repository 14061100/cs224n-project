{"summary": "A solvent is a substance, that becomes a solution by dissolving a solid, liquid, or gaseous solute.", "full_text": "The relative permittivity of a material is its dielectric permittivity expressed as a ratio relative to the permittivity of vacuum.\nPermittivity is a material property that affects the Coulomb force between two point charges in the material. Relative permittivity is the factor by which the electric field between the charges is decreased relative to vacuum.\nLikewise, relative permittivity is the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared to a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric. Relative permittivity is also commonly known as dielectric constant, a term deprecated in physics and engineering, but one which is still commonly used in chemistry.", "title": "Dielectric constant"}
