While Japan wanted the focus of the pact to be aimed at the Soviet Union, Italy and Germany wanted it aimed at Britain and France. Due to this disagreement, the pact was signed without Japan and became an agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, signed on 22 May 1939 by foreign ministers Galeazzo Ciano of Italy and Joachim von Ribbentrop of Germany.\nThe pact consisted of two parts. The first section was an open declaration of continuing trust and cooperation between Germany and Italy while the second, a \"Secret Supplementary Protocol\", encouraged a union of policies concerning the military and economy. Although intended to last 10 years, it was effectively cancelled in 1943 with removal of Italy's fascist government.\nIt was Italian leader Benito Mussolini who dubbed the agreement the \"Pact of Steel\", after being told that the original name, \"Pact of Blood\", would most likely be poorly received in Italy.", "title": "Pact of Steel"}
