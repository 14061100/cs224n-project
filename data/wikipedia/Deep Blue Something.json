{"summary": "1995  was a common year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Deep Blue Something are an American rock band who are best known for their 1995 hit single \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" from their second album Home. Home achieved gold-record status; however, the band parted ways with Interscope and went on creative hiatus for several years, only releasing the follow-up Byzantium in Japan and some European countries. They eventually signed with the Azera label and released Deep Blue Something in mid-2001, breaking up shortly after. With only one single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, they are often considered a one-hit-wonder. The band now has recently regrouped with all members at the end of 2014 and signed to John Kirtland's independent label, Kirtland Records.", "title": "Deep Blue Something"}
