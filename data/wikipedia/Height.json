{"summary": "Height is the distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object.", "full_text": "Height is the measure of vertical distance, but has two meanings in common use. It can either indicate how \"tall\" something is, or how \"high up\" it is. For example \"The height of the building is 50 m\" or \"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\".

Height is measured along the vertical  axis between a specified point and another .", "title": "Height"}
