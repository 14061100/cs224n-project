{"summary": "A millennium  is a time period of one thousand  years.", "full_text": "A millennium  is a period of time equal to 1000 years. It derives from the Latin mille, thousand, and annus, year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular dating system.\nSometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point  of the calendar in consideration , or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case  it may have religious or theological implications . Sometimes in use, such an interval called a \"millennium\" might be interpreted less precisely, i.e., not always being exactly 1000 years long. It could be, for example, 1050, etc.", "title": "Millennium"}
