{"summary": "Steven Tyler  is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and a television music competition judge.", "full_text": "Steven Tyler  is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and former television music competition judge, best known as the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, in which he also plays the harmonica, and occasional piano and percussion. He is known as the \"Demon of Screamin'\" due to his high screams and his wide vocal range. He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics. During his high-energy performances, Tyler usually dresses in bright, colorful outfits with his trademark scarves hanging from his microphone stand.\nIn the 1970s, Tyler rose to prominence as the lead singer of Aerosmith, which released such milestone hard rock albums as Toys in the Attic and Rocks, along with a string of hit singles, including \"Dream On\", \"Sweet Emotion\", and \"Walk This Way\". In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyler had a heavy drug and alcohol addiction, and the band's popularity waned. Tyler and bandmate Joe Perry became known as the \"Toxic Twins\" due to their drug abuse. In 1986, Tyler completed drug rehabilitation and Aerosmith rose to prominence again when Tyler and Perry joined Run-D.M.C. for a re-make of the classic Aerosmith song \"Walk This Way\", which became a Top 5 hit. Aerosmith subsequently launched a remarkable comeback with the multi-platinum albums Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip, and Nine Lives, which produced a combined thirteen Top 40 singles and won the band numerous awards. During this time, the band embarked on their longest and most extensive concert tours, promoted their singles with conceptual music videos, and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In the wake of this success, Tyler emerged as one of the most enduring rock icons. Since the late 1980s, he has embarked on several solo endeavors including guest appearances on other artists' music , film and TV roles , authoring a bestselling book, and solo work . While tension with his Aerosmith bandmates boiled in 2009 and 2010 after he fell off the stage at a concert, had a relapse with prescription drugs , and signed on to American Idol without telling his bandmates, Tyler has continued to record music and perform with Aerosmith, after more than 45 years in the band. In May 2015, Tyler released the country single \"Love is Your Name\"; his debut solo album is expected to be released in early 2016.\nTyler is included among Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Singers. He was ranked 3rd on Hit Parader's Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time. In 2001, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Aerosmith, and in 2013, Tyler and his songwriting partner Joe Perry received the ASCAP Founders Award and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.", "title": "Steven Tyler"}
