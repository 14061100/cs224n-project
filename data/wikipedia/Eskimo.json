{"summary": "The Inuit are one of many groups of First Nations who live in very cold places of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and Alaska.", "full_text": "The Eskimo are the indigenous peoples who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern Siberia , across Alaska , Canada, and Greenland.\nThe two main peoples known as \"Eskimo\" are: the Inuit of Canada, Northern Alaska , and Greenland, and the Yupik of eastern Siberia and Alaska. The Yupik comprise speakers of four distinct Yupik languages: one used in the Russian Far East and the others among people of Western Alaska, Southcentral Alaska and along the Gulf of Alaska coast. A third northern group, the Aleut, is closely related to the Eskimo. They share a relatively recent, common  ancestor, and a language group .\nWhile since the late 20th century numerous indigenous people viewed the use of the term \"Eskimo\" as offensive, because it was used by people who discriminated against them, in its linguistic origins the word did not have an offensive meaning. Alternative terms, such as Inuit-Yupik, have been proposed, but none has gained widespread acceptance.\nIn Canada and Greenland, the term \"Eskimo\" has fallen out of favor as pejorative and has been widely replaced by the term \"Inuit\", \"Alaska Natives\", or terms specific to a particular tribe. Under U.S. and Alaskan law, however, as well as the linguistic and cultural traditions of Alaska, \"Alaska Natives\" refers to all indigenous peoples of Alaska. The term is applied to not only such groups as the Aleut, who share a recent ancestor with the Inuit and Yupik groups, but also to the largely unrelated indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and the Dene, who descend from other, unrelated major language and ethnic groups.\nThe Canadian Constitution Act of 1982, sections 25 and 35 recognized the Inuit as a distinctive group of aboriginal peoples in Canada.", "title": "Eskimo"}
