{"summary": "Micronations are countries started by one or a group of people which is not noticed by the United Nations.", "full_text": "A micronation, sometimes referred to as a model country or new country project, is an entity that claims to be an independent nation or state but is not officially recognized by world governments or major international organizations.\nMicronations are distinguished from imaginary countries and from other kinds of social groups  by expressing a formal and persistent, even if unrecognized, claim of sovereignty over some physical territory.\nSeveral micronations have issued coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals, and other items, which are rarely accepted outside of their own community.\nThe earliest known micronations date from the beginning of the 19th century. The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations, whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means, often calling their nations Nomadic Countries. The differences between such Internet micronations, other kinds of social networking groups, and role playing games are often difficult to define.\nThe term \"micronation\" to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s. The term micropatrology is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and microstates by micronationalists, some of whom refer to sovereign nation-states as \"macronations\".", "title": "Micronation"}
