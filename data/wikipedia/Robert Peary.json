{"summary": "Robert Edwin Peary, Sr.", "full_text": "Robert Edwin Peary, Sr.  was an American explorer who claimed to have reached the geographic North Pole with his expedition on April 6, 1909. Peary's claim was widely credited for most of the 20th century, rather than the competing claim by Frederick Cook, who said he got there a year earlier. Both claims were widely debated in newspapers until 1913.\nModern historians generally think Cook did not reach the pole. Based on an evaluation of Peary's records, British polar explorer Wally Herbert concluded in a 1989 book that Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as 60 miles . His conclusions have been widely accepted. Ralph Plaisted  and his three companions, Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, are regarded by most polar authorities to be the first to succeed in a surface traverse across the ice to the North Pole on 19 April 1968, making the first confirmed surface conquest of the Pole. Herbert was the first undisputed explorer to reach the North Pole by surface travel, leading a British expedition in 1969 .", "title": "Robert Peary"}
