{"summary": "Good Friday is a religious holiday usually observed by Christians.", "full_text": "Good Friday is a Christian religious holiday commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. The holiday is observed during Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday, and may coincide with the Jewish observance of Passover. It is also known as Holy Friday, Great Friday, Black Friday, or Easter Friday, though the last term properly refers to the Friday in Easter week.\nGood Friday is a widely-instituted legal holiday in many national governments around the world, including in most Western countries  as well as in 12 U.S. states. Some governments, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting certain acts, such as dancing and horse racing, that are seen as profaning the solemn nature of the day.", "title": "Good Friday"}
