{"summary": "Bulgaria  is a country in southeastern Europe.", "full_text": "The Kingdom of Bulgaria, also referred to as the Tsardom of Bulgaria and the Third Bulgarian Tsardom was a constitutional monarchy, which was established on 5 October  1908 when the Bulgarian state was raised from a principality to a kingdom. Ferdinand I was crowned a Tsar at the declaration of independence, mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all Balkan lands with an ethnic Bulgarian majority .\nThe state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence, lending to its nickname as \"the Balkan Prussia\". For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the next decade  it engaged in three wars - the First and Second Balkan Wars, and the First World War. Following the First World War the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the Allied powers, and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed. Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the Second World War, and once again found itself on the losing side, until it switched sides to the Allies in 1944. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished, its final Tsar was sent into exile and the Kingdom was replaced by a the People's Republic of Bulgaria.", "title": "Kingdom of Bulgaria"}
