{"summary": "1999  was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "The 921 earthquake , also known as Jiji earthquake , was a 7.3 Ms or 7.6-7.7 Mw earthquake which occurred in Jiji , Nantou County, Taiwan on Tuesday, 21 September 1999 at 01:47:12.6 TST . 2,415 people were killed, 11,305 injured, and NT$300 billion  worth of damage was done. It was the second-deadliest quake in recorded history in Taiwan, after the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake.\nRescue groups from around the world joined local relief workers and the ROC military in digging out survivors, clearing rubble, restoring essential services and distributing food and other aid to the more than 100,000 people made homeless by the quake. The disaster, dubbed the \"Quake of the Century\" by local media, had a profound effect on the economy of the island and the consciousness of the people, and dissatisfaction with government's performance in reacting to it was said by some commentators to be a factor in the unseating of the ruling Kuomintang party in the 2000 Presidential Election.", "title": "921 earthquake"}
