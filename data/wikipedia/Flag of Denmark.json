{"summary": "The Flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog is red with a white Scandinavian cross.", "full_text": "The Flag of Denmark  is red with a white Scandinavian cross that extends to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side. The cross design, which represents Christianity, was subsequently adopted by other Nordic countries: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, as well as the British archipelagos of Shetland and Orkney. During the Danish-Norwegian personal union, Dannebrog  was also the flag of Norway and continued to be, with slight modifications, until Norway adopted its current flag in 1821.\nThe design of the Dannebrog is recorded on a seal from 1397. According to legend, the flag came into Danish possession during the Battle of Lyndanisse in 1219. The Danes were on a failing crusade in Estonia, but after praying to God a flag fell from the sky. After this event, Danish King Valdemar II went on to defeat the Estonians. The first recorded use of the flag appears one hundred years later.\n\n", "title": "Flag of Denmark"}
