{"summary": "Comic books are books with comics, with pictures that make a story.", "full_text": "A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comics art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although comic books have some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.\nIt is important to distinguish the terminology used in the world of comics. A comic book is often confused with a graphic novel. However, unlike comic books, graphic novels are not periodical in nature and are a long form of usually fictional works. Similarly, a trade paperback is a reprinted collection of the stories previously published as comic books. Individual comic strips may not form part of a larger story arc and are generally regarded for their humor. Lastly, a comics anthology gathers together different short works for publication under one title.", "title": "Comic book"}
