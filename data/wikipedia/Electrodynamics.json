{"summary": "Quantum electrodynamics  is the quantum theory of electricity and magnetism.", "full_text": "Classical electromagnetism or classical electrodynamics is a branch of theoretical physics that studies the interactions between electric charges and currents using an extension of the classical Newtonian model. The theory provides an excellent description of electromagnetic phenomena whenever the relevant length scales and field strengths are large enough that quantum mechanical effects are negligible. For small distances and low field strengths, such interactions are better described by quantum electrodynamics.\nFundamental physical aspects of classical electrodynamics are presented in many texts, such as those by Feynman, Leighton and Sands, Panofsky and Phillips, and Jackson.", "title": "Electrodynamics"}
