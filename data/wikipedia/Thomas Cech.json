Cech discovered that RNA could itself cut strands of RNA, which showed that life could have started as RNA. He also studied telomeres, and his lab discovered an enzyme, TERT , which is part of the process of restoring telomeres after they are shortened during cell division. As president of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, he promoted science education, and he teaches an undergraduate chemistry course at the University of Colorado.\n^ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989: Illustrated Presentation\n^ Telomeres, Telomerase, and Other Noncoding RNAs, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, July 13, 2010", "title": "Thomas Cech"}
