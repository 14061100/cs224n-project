{"summary": "A district is an area or locality.", "full_text": "The politics of Switzerland take place in the framework of a multi-party federal directorial democratic republic, whereby the Federal Council of Switzerland is the collective head of government and head of state. Executive power is exercised by the government and the federal administration and is not concentrated in any one person. Federal legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\nSwitzerland is the closest state in the world to a direct democracy. For any change in the constitution, a referendum is mandatory ; for any change in a law, a referendum can be requested . Through referenda, citizens may challenge any law voted by federal parliament and through federal popular initiative introduce amendments to the federal constitution.\nThe same system is used for the three administrative levels municipality, canton, country. If the community is small enough like in little villages, the parliament representing the people does not exist. Also the ordinary law does then not exist, only the constitution of the village. The term \"council\" is used ambiguously, sometimes it refers to legislation, i.e. parliament, sometimes to the execution, i.e. government.", "title": "Politics of Switzerland"}
