{"summary": "Metaphor is a term for a figure of speech.", "full_text": "A metaphor is a figure of speech that identifies something as being the same as some unrelated thing for rhetorical effect, thus highlighting the similarities between the two. While a simile compares two items, a metaphor directly equates them, and does not use \"like\" or \"as\" as does a simile. One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature is the \"All the world's a stage\" monologue from As You Like It:\n\nThis quotation expresses a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage. By figuratively asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses the points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the behavior of the people within it.\nThe Philosophy of Rhetoric  by I. A. Richards describes a metaphor as having two parts: the tenor and the vehicle. The tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed. The vehicle is the object whose attributes are borrowed. In the previous example, \"the world\" is compared to a stage, describing it with the attributes of \"the stage\"; \"the world\" is the tenor, and \"a stage\" is the vehicle; \"men and women\" is the secondary tenor, and \"players\" is the secondary vehicle.\nOther writers employ the general terms ground and figure to denote the tenor and the vehicle. Cognitive linguistics uses the terms target and source respectively.", "title": "Metaphor"}
