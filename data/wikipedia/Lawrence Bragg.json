He was joint winner  of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915: \"For their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-ray\" an important step in the development of X-ray crystallography.\nBragg was knighted in 1941. As of 2014, Lawrence Bragg is the youngest ever Nobel Laureate in physics, having received the award at the age of 25 years.  Bragg was the director of the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, when the discovery of the structure of DNA was reported by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953.", "title": "Lawrence Bragg"}
