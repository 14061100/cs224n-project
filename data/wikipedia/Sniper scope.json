{"summary": "A sniper scope is a kind of telescope that is attached on the top of a rifle.", "full_text": "A telescopic sight, commonly called a scope, is a sighting device that is based on an optical refracting telescope. They are equipped with some form of graphic image pattern  mounted in an optically appropriate position in their optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used with all types of systems that require accurate aiming but are most commonly found on firearms, particularly rifles. Other types of sights are iron sights, reflector  sights, and laser sights. The optical components may be combined with optoelectronics to form a night scope.", "title": "Sniper scope"}
