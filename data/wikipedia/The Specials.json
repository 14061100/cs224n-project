{"summary": "The Specials were an English new wave/ska band.", "full_text": "The Specials, also known as The Special AKA, are an English 2 Tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. Their music combines a \"danceable ska and rocksteady beat with punk's energy and attitude\", and had a \"more focused and informed political and social stance\" than other ska groups.\nThe band wore mod-style \"1960s period rude boy outfits .\" In 1980, the song \"Too Much Too Young\", the lead track on their The Special AKA Live! EP, reached number one in the UK. In 1981, the unemployment-themed single \"Ghost Town\" also hit number one in the UK Singles Chart.\nAfter seven consecutive UK Top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, several members of the group abruptly left to form the Fun Boy Three. Continuing on as \"The Special AKA\" , a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material through 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single \"Free Nelson Mandela\". Afterwards, founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism.\nThe group reformed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups .", "title": "The Specials"}
