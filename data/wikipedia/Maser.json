{"summary": "A maser is a device that produces light and heat by using atoms to release energy.", "full_text": "A maser , an acronym for \"microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\", is a device that produces coherent electromagnetic waves through amplification by stimulated emission. The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger at Columbia University in 1953. Townes, Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov were awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work leading to the maser. Masers are used as the timekeeping device in atomic clocks, and as extremely low-noise microwave amplifiers in radio telescopes and deep space spacecraft communication ground stations.\nContemporary masers can be designed to generate electromagnetic waves at not only microwave frequencies but also radio and infrared frequencies. For this reason Charles Townes suggested replacing \"microwave\" with the word \"molecular\" as the first word in the acronym maser.\nThe laser works by the same principle as the maser, and the maser was the forerunner of the laser, inspiring theoretical work by Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow that led to its invention in 1960. When the coherent optical oscillator was first imagined in 1957, it was originally called the \"optical maser.\" This was ultimately changed to laser for \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.\" Gordon Gould is credited with creating this acronym in 1957.", "title": "Maser"}
