{"summary": "The Weimar Republic  is the name now used for the republic that governed Germany from 1919 to 1933.", "full_text": "The Reichsrat was one of two legislative bodies in Germany during Weimar Republic , the other being the Reichstag.\nThe Reichsrat consisted of members appointed by the German States and participated in legislation affecting all constitutional changes and state competences, while the Reichstag was the elected body of the people. Therefore, the Reichsrat functioned similarly to a parliamentary upper house, such as the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, although the Weimar constitution did not specifically spell out a bicameral parliament. The Reichsrat was the successor body to the Bundesrat of the German Empire , which was a more formalized upper house.\n\n", "title": "Reichsrat (Germany)"}
