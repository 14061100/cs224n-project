{"summary": "Implication and inference are two related words which are opposites.", "full_text": "Inductive programming  is a special area of automatic programming, covering research from artificial intelligence and programming, which addresses learning of typically declarative  and often recursive programs from incomplete specifications, such as input/output examples or constraints.\nDepending on the programming language used, there are several kinds of inductive programming. Inductive functional programming, which uses functional programming languages such as Lisp or Haskell, and most especially inductive logic programming, which uses logic programming languages such as Prolog and other logical representations such as description logics, have been more prominent, but other  language paradigms have also been used, such as constraint programming or probabilistic programming.", "title": "Inference (grammar)"}
