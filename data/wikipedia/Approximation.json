{"summary": "An approximation is a version of a piece of information that does not describe it exactly, but is close enough to be used.", "full_text": "An approximation is anything that is similar but not exactly equal to something else. The term can be applied to various properties  that are nearly, but not exactly correct; similar, but not exactly the same .\nAlthough approximation is most often applied to numbers, it is also frequently applied to such things as mathematical functions, shapes, and physical laws.\nIn science, approximation can refer to using a simpler process or model when the correct model is difficult to use. An approximate model is used to make calculations easier. Approximations might also be used if incomplete information prevents use of exact representations.\nThe type of approximation used depends on the available information, the degree of accuracy required, the sensitivity of the problem to this data, and the savings  that can be achieved by approximation.", "title": "Approximation"}
