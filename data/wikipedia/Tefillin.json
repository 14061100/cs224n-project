{"summary": "Tanakh is an acronym that is almost the same thing as saying the \"Hebrew Bible.\"", "full_text": "Tefillin  also called phylacteries  are a set of small black leather boxes containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah, which are worn by observant Jews during weekday morning prayers. Although \"tefillin\" is technically the plural form , it is loosely used as a singular as well. The arm-tefillin, or shel yad, is placed on the upper arm, and the strap wrapped around the arm/hand, hand and fingers; while the head-tefillin, or shel rosh, is placed above the forehead. The Torah commands that they should be worn to serve as a \"sign\" and \"remembrance\" that God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt.\nThe scriptural texts for tefillin are obscure in literal meaning. For example, Deuteronomy 11:18 is one of the standard texts referenced as supporting the obligation, but does not designate what specifically to \"bind upon your arm,\" and the definition of totafot between your eyes is not obvious. It is the Talmud, the authoritative oral tradition for Rabbinic Judaism, which explains what are to be bound to the body and the form of tefillin.", "title": "Tefillin"}
