{"summary": "1990  was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Flashpoint is a live album by British rock band The Rolling Stones. It was released in 1991, having been recorded throughout 1989 and 1990 on the mammoth Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour. It was the first live album by the group since 1982's \"Still Life\" . It was recorded using binaural recording. This gives the effect that the concert audience is behind the home listener. The audience cheer track was taken from the Rolling Stones' 1970 live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out, complete with an audience member shouting out a request: \"'Paint It, Black', 'Paint It, Black', you devil\". The two studio tracks on the album would be the last for bassist and long-time member Bill Wyman as a Rolling Stone.", "title": "Korakuen Dome"}
