{"summary": "Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi  was an Egyptian poet.", "full_text": "Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi   was a popular Egyptian poet, and more recently a children's books writer. He was one of a generation of poets who wrote their work in the Egyptian dialect rather than in Classical Arabic, the standard literary language. This literary stance was associated with a militant political engagement: Abnudi and other writers of this school sought to make their literary production part of the process of development and movement towards popular democracy in Egypt. He was formerly the husband of documentary and short film director Attiyat El Abnoudy. He later married Nehal Kamal. He was the father of two children, Nour and Aya.\n\n", "title": "Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi"}
