{"summary": "The second law of thermodynamics states that whenever energy is transformed from one form to another form, entropy increases and energy decreases.", "full_text": "The second law of thermodynamics states that in every real process the sum of the entropies of all participating bodies is increased. In the idealized limiting case of a reversible process, this sum remains unchanged. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past.\nWhile often applied to more general processes, the law technically pertains to an event in which bodies initially in thermodynamic equilibrium are put into contact and allowed to come to a new equilibrium. This equilibration process involves the spread, dispersal, or dissipation of matter or energy and results in an increase of entropy.\nThe second law is an empirical finding that has been accepted as an axiom of thermodynamic theory. Statistical thermodynamics, classical or quantum, explains the microscopic origin of the law.\nThe second law has been expressed in many ways. Its first formulation is credited to the French scientist Sadi Carnot in 1824 .", "title": "Second law of thermodynamics"}
