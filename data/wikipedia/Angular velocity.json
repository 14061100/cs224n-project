{"summary": "In physics, the angular velocity specifies the angular speed at which an object is rotating along with the direction in which it is rotating.", "full_text": "In physics, the angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of angular displacement and is a vector quantity  which specifies the angular speed  of an object and the axis about which the object is rotating. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second, although it may be measured in other units such as degrees per second, degrees per hour, etc. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega .\nThe direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, in a direction which is usually specified by the right-hand rule.", "title": "Angular velocity"}
