{"summary": "Telomerase is an RNA protein which is an enzyme.", "full_text": "Proper length or rest length refers to the length of an object in the object's rest frame.\nThe measurement of lengths is more complicated in the theory of relativity than in classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, lengths are measured based on the assumption that the locations of all points involved are measured simultaneously. But in the theory of relativity, the notion of simultaneity is dependent on the observer.\nA different term, proper distance, provides an invariant measure whose value is the same for all observers.\nProper distance is analogous to proper time. The difference is that a proper distance is the square root of  the spacetime interval of two spacelike-separated events , while a proper time is the square root of  the spacetime interval of two timelike-separated events .\n\n", "title": "Proper length"}
