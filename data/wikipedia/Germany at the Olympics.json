{"summary": "German athletes have been a part of most of the Olympic Games since the first modern Games in 1896.", "full_text": "Athletes from Germany have taken part in most of the Olympic Games since the first modern Games in 1896. Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germans were banned from participating in 1920, 1924 and 1948. While the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted the Summer Games: in 1980 West Germany was one of 65 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union  in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles.\nIncluding the Winter Games of 2014, German athletes have won 1681 medals: 547 gold, 567 silver and 567 bronze. The IOC currently splits these results among four codes, even though only the East German Democratic Republic  from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany  since 1896.", "title": "Germany at the Olympics"}
