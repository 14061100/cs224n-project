{"summary": "A vocational school is a school where students go to learn how to do a particular job.", "full_text": "A vocational school, also called a trade school, is a higher-level learning institution that specializes in providing students with the vocational education and technical skills they need in order to perform the tasks of a particular job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year universities by their goal to impart job-specific training and education to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools has since begun to shift \"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\" as well as technical skills of their students, following the advent of the 1990s.", "title": "Trade school"}
