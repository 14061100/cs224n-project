At the 1999 U.S. Open Stewart captured his third major title after holing a 15-foot  par putt on the final hole for a one stroke victory.\nStewart was a popular golfer with spectators, who responded enthusiastically to his distinctive clothing. He was reputed to have the biggest wardrobe of all professional golfers and was a favorite of photographers because of his flamboyant attire of ivy caps and patterned pants, which were a cross between plus fours and knickerbockers, a throwback to the once-commonplace golf \"uniform\". Stewart was also admired for having one of the most gracefully fluid and stylish golf swings of the modern era.", "title": "Payne Stewart"}
