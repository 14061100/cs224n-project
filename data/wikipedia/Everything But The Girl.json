{"summary": "1995  was a common year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Everything but the Girl  was an English musical duo, formed in Hull in 1982, consisting of lead singer and occasional guitarist Tracey Thorn and guitarist, keyboardist, and singer Ben Watt. The duo's most successful single was a Todd Terry remix of \"Missing\" charting in several countries in 1995.\nThey are currently inactive, although vocalist Tracey Thorn hinted that they may perform again someday. They have not performed publicly since 2000, and as Thorn stated on BBC Radio4 on 25 January 2014, \"for both Ben and me, it would feel like a step backwards\".\nWatt and Thorn are also a couple; they are very private about their relationship and personal life. For some time, it was not a publicised fact that they were a couple, or that they had married subsequently. The duo have expressed a strong desire to raise their three children with as much privacy as possible.", "title": "Everything But The Girl"}
