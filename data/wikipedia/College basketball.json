{"summary": "College basketball is basketball played between teams from colleges or universities, usually in the United States.", "full_text": "The history of basketball is traced back to a YMCA International Training School, known today as Springfield College, located in Springfield, Massachusetts. The sport was created by a physical education teacher named James Naismith, who in the winter of 1891 was given the task of creating a game that would keep track athletes in shape and that would prevent them from getting hurt a lot. The date of the first formal basketball played at the Springfield YMCA Training School under Naismith's rules is generally given as December 21, 1891. Basketball began to spread to college campuses by 1893.\nCollege basketball today is governed by collegiate athletic bodies including the United States' National Collegiate Athletic Association , the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics , the United States Collegiate Athletic Association , the National Junior College Athletic Association  and the National Christian College Athletic Association . Each of these various organizations are subdivided into from one to three divisions based on the number and level of scholarships that may be provided to the athletes.", "title": "College basketball"}
