{"summary": "Positronium is a type of exotic atom that is made of one positron and one electron.", "full_text": "An exotic atom is an otherwise normal atom in which one or more sub-atomic particles have been replaced by other particles of the same charge. For example, electrons may be replaced by other negatively charged particles such as muons  or pions . Because these substitute particles are usually unstable, exotic atoms typically have very short lifetimes.", "title": "Exotic atom"}
