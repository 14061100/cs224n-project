{"summary": "A wormhole is a theoretical connection between a black hole and a white hole creating a shortcut through time and space.", "full_text": "A wormhole or Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a hypothetical topological feature that would fundamentally be a shortcut connecting two separate points in spacetime. A wormhole, in theory, might be able to connect extremely far distances such as a billion light years or more, short distances such as a few feet, different universes, and different points in time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime.\nFor a simplified notion of a wormhole, space can be visualized as a two-dimensional  surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a 3D tube , then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a 2D plane, the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in 3D space.\n\n", "title": "Einstein-Rosen Bridge"}
