{"summary": "Barbados is an island country in the Caribbean Sea.", "full_text": "Barbados  is a sovereign island country in the Lesser Antilles, in the Americas. It is 34 kilometres  in length and up to 23 kilometres  in width, covering an area of 432 square kilometres . It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 kilometres  east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea; therein, it is about 168 kilometres  east of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and 400 kilometres  north-east of Trinidad and Tobago. Barbados is outside of the principal Atlantic hurricane belt.\nInhabited by Kalingo people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other Amerindians, Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the Spanish Crown. It first appears on a Spanish map from 1511. The Portuguese visited the island in 1536, but they left it unclaimed, with their only remnants being an introduction of wild hogs for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited. An English ship, the Olive Blossom, arrived in Barbados in 1625; its men took possession of it in the name of King James I. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and it became an English and later British colony.\nIn 1966, Barbados became an independent state and Commonwealth realm with the British Monarch  as hereditary head of state. It has a population of 277,821 people, mostly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. In 2014, Barbados ranked second in the Americas  and 17th globally  on Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index.", "title": "Barbados"}
