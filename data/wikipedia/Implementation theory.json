{"summary": "Eric Stark Maskin  is an American economist.", "full_text": "Implementation theory is an area of game theory closely related to mechanism design where an attempt is made to add into a game a mechanism such that the equilibrium of the game conforms to some concept of social optimality .\nIn a game where multiple agents are to report their preferences , it may be in the best interest of some agents to lie about their preferences. This may improve their payoff, but it may not be seen as a fair outcome to other agents. In order to implement a more \"fair\" outcome, in a repeated game, the other players may choose to punish any \"cheaters\".\nThe conditions of a repeated game where an arbitrary outcome may be enforced are set out in theorems often known as folk theorems. If a game is not repeated, it may only be possible to implement outcomes which are Nash equilibria or satisfy some other equilibrium concept.", "title": "Implementation theory"}
