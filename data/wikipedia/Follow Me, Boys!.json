{"summary": "1966  was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Follow Me, Boys! is a 1966 family film produced by Walt Disney Productions, based on the book God and My Country by MacKinlay Kantor. It was the last production released by Disney before Walt Disney died of lung cancer, two weeks after the film's release.\nThe film starred Fred MacMurray, Vera Miles, Lillian Gish, Charles Ruggles and Kurt Russell, was co-produced by Walt Disney and Winston Hibler, directed by Norman Tokar, and written by Louis Pelletier. The film is also known by its working title, On My Honor.\nIt is one of the few movies where Boy Scouts are key to the film and is Disney's paean to the Boy Scouts. The title song \"Follow Me, Boys!\" was written by studio favorites Robert and Richard Sherman. For a time, after the film was released, the Boy Scouts of America was considering using the song as their anthem, but efforts toward this end were eventually dropped. Boys' Life for December 1966 included a teaser article on the film.\nThis is the first of ten Disney films in which Kurt Russell would appear over the next ten years. A DVD version was released on February 3, 2004 by Walt Disney Home Entertainment, although it is in 4:3 pan and scan format, not the original 1.66:1 wide screen aspect ratio.", "title": "Follow Me, Boys!"}
