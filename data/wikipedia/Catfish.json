{"summary": "Catfish are an order of teleost fish, the Siluriformes.", "full_text": "Catfishes  are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the two largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia and the wels catfish of Eurasia, to detritivores , and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others  are crepuscular or diurnal .", "title": "Catfish"}
