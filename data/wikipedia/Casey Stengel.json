{"summary": "Charles Dillon  Stengel was a famous baseball player and manager.", "full_text": "Charles Dillon \"Casey\" Stengel , nicknamed \"The Old Perfessor\", was an American Major League Baseball outfielder and manager. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966.\nStengel was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and originally nicknamed \"Dutch\", a common nickname at that time for Americans of German ancestry. After his major league career began, he acquired the nickname \"Casey\", which originally came from the initials of his hometown , which evolved into \"Casey\", influenced by the wide popularity of the poem Casey at the Bat. In the 1950s, sportswriters dubbed him with yet another nickname, \"The Old Professor\" , for his sharp wit and his ability to talk at length on anything baseball-related.\nAlthough his baseball career spanned a number of teams and cities, he is primarily associated with clubs in New York City. Between playing and managing, he is the only man to have worn four of New York's major league clubs' uniforms. He was the first of four men  to manage both the New York Yankees and New York Mets; Yogi Berra, Dallas Green, and Joe Torre are the others. Like Torre, he also managed the Braves and the Dodgers. He ended his baseball career as the beloved manager for the then expansion New York Mets, which won over the hearts of New York partly due to the unique character of their veteran leader.", "title": "Casey Stengel"}
