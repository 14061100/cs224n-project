He currently works in the Tampa Bay Rays' front office as an advisor and also for Bright House Sports Network as a co-host for \"The Baysball Show\".\nMcGriff's nickname, \"Crime Dog\", one of the many humorous nicknames created by sports broadcaster Chris Berman, is a play on McGruff, a cartoon dog created for American police to raise children's awareness on crime prevention. At first, McGriff stated he would prefer \"Fire Dog\" , but since has stated that he actually is fond of the \"Crime Dog\" nickname.", "title": "Fred McGriff"}
