{"summary": "Classical conditioning  is a form of associative learning.", "full_text": "Classical conditioning  is a learning process in which an innate response to a potent stimulus comes to be elicited in response to a previously neutral stimulus; this is achieved by repeated pairings of the neutral stimulus with the potent stimulus. The basic facts about classical conditioning were discovered by Ivan Pavlov through his famous experiments with dogs. Together with operant conditioning, classical conditioning became the foundation of Behaviorism, a school of psychology that dominated psychology in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of psychological therapy and the study of animal behaviour . Classical conditioning is now the best understood of the basic learning processes, and its neural substrates are beginning to be understood.\n\n", "title": "Classical conditioning"}
