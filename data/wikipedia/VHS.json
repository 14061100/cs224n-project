{"summary": "VHS means Video Home System.", "full_text": "The Video Home System  is a standard for consumer-level use of analog recording on videotape cassettes. It was developed by Victor Company of Japan  in the 1970s.\nFrom the 1950s magnetic tape video recording became a major contributor to the television industry, via the first commercialized video tape recorders . At that time, the devices were used only in expensive professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging . In the 1970s videotape entered home use, creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses. The television industry viewed VCRs as having the power to disrupt their business, while television users viewed the VCR as the means to take control of their hobby.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, at the peak of VHS's popularity, there were videotape format wars in the home video industry. Two of the formats, VHS and Betamax, received the most media exposure. VHS eventually won the war, succeeding as the dominant home video format throughout the tape media period.\nOptical disc formats later began to offer better quality than analog consumer video tape such as standard and super-VHS. The earliest of these formats, LaserDisc, was not widely adopted. However, after the introduction of the DVD format in 1997, VHS's market share began to decline. By 2008 DVD had achieved mass acceptance and replaced VHS as the preferred method of distribution.\n\n", "title": "VHS"}
