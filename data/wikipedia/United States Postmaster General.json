{"summary": "The United States Postmaster General is the executive head of the United States Postal Service.", "full_text": "The Postmaster General of the United States is the chief executive officer of the United States Postal Service. The office, in one form or another, is older than both the United States Constitution and the United States Declaration of Independence. Benjamin Franklin was appointed by the Continental Congress as the first Postmaster General in 1775, serving just over 15 months.\nUntil 1971, the postmaster general was the head of the Post Office Department . From 1829 to 1971, he was a member of the President's Cabinet.\nThe Cabinet post of Postmaster General was often given to a new President's campaign manager or other key political supporter, and was considered something of a sinecure. The Postmaster General was in charge of the governing party's patronage, and was a powerful position which held much influence within the party.\nIn 1971, the Post Office Department was re-organized into the United States Postal Service, an independent agency of the executive branch. Thus, the Postmaster General is no longer a member of the Cabinet and is no longer in Presidential succession.\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America Post-office Department provided mail service for the Confederate States, headed by a Postmaster General, John Henninger Reagan.\nThe Postmaster General is the second-highest paid U.S. government official, based on publicly available salary information, after the President of the United States.\n\n", "title": "United States Postmaster General"}
