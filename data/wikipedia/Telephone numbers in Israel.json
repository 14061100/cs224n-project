{"summary": "The following is a list of country calling codes.", "full_text": "Until the 1990s, telephone numbers in Israel had 6 digits , and until the 2000s, there were 8 area codes allocated to Bezeq, by region. Currently numbers have seven digits and Bezeq controls 6 area codes - 02 , 03 , 04 and 06  were merged, as well as 07 , 08  and 09 . Israel's country calling code is +972.\nWith the influence of VOIP long distance was deregulated in Israel. According to the Israel Ministry of Communication a VOIP number may be ported to a landline carrier and vice versa providing the option to have, say, a northern number in the south of the country. Numbers may not be ported, say, from the north to the south of the country on the same kind of line . Mobile number portability between cellular providers was introduced in late 2007.\nThe format for calls to landlines within the same area code is XXX-XXXX. For calls to a landline outside the local area, the area code is prefixed and the format becomes  XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, where \"0Y\" is the area code. The format for calls to mobile and VOIP lines is 0YZ-XXX-XXXX, where \"0YZ\" is the mobile or VOIP indicator. When calling from outside of Israel, the leading \"0\" in area codes is not dialed, and the format is +972-Y-XXX-XXXX for calls to landlines, or +972-YZ-XXX-XXXX for calls to mobile and VOIP lines.", "title": "Telephone numbers in Israel"}
