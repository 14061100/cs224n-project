{"summary": "In physics, intensity can usually be understood as the strength of something like a beam of light.", "full_text": "In physics, intensity is the power transferred per unit area, where the area is an imagined surface that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the energy. In the SI system, it has units watts per square metre . It is used most frequently with waves , in which case the average power transfer over one period of the wave is used. Intensity can be applied to other circumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the intensity of the kinetic energy carried by drops of water from a garden sprinkler.\nThe word \"intensity\" as used here is not synonymous with \"strength\", \"amplitude\", \"magnitude\", or \"level\", as it sometimes is in colloquial speech.\nIntensity can be found by taking the energy density  at a point in space and multiplying it by the velocity at which the energy is moving. The resulting vector has the units of power divided by area.\n^ \"intensity\". Merriam-Webster.com. Retrieved Feb 15, 2015.", "title": "Intensity (physics)"}
