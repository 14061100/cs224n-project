{"summary": "Terbium is a chemical element that has the symbol Tb on the periodic table.", "full_text": "Terbium is a chemical element with symbol Tb and atomic number 65. It is a silvery-white rare earth metal that is malleable, ductile and soft enough to be cut with a knife. Terbium is never found in nature as a free element, but it is contained in many minerals, including cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime and euxenite.\nSwedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, discovered terbium as a separate elemental compound, in 1843. He detected it as an impurity in yttrium oxide, Y2O3. Yttrium and terbium are named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden. Terbium was not isolated in pure form until the advent of ion exchange techniques.\nTerbium is used to dope calcium fluoride, calcium tungstate and strontium molybdate, materials that are used in solid-state devices, and as a crystal stabilizer of fuel cells which operate at elevated temperatures. As a component of Terfenol-D , terbium is of use in actuators, in naval sonar systems and in sensors.\nMost of the world's terbium supply is used in green phosphors. Terbium oxide is in fluorescent lamps and TV tubes. Terbium green phosphors are combined with divalent europium blue phosphors and trivalent europium red phosphors to provide \"trichromatic\" lighting technology, a high-efficiency white light used for standard illumination in indoor lighting.", "title": "Terbium"}
