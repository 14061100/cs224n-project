{"summary": "Chaos theory is a part of mathematics.", "full_text": "In mathematics, a dynamical system is a set of relationships among two or more measurable quantities, in which a fixed rule describes how the quantities evolve over time in response to their own values. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.\nAt any given time a dynamical system has a state given by a set of real numbers  that can be represented by a point in an appropriate state space . The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is deterministic; in other words, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state; however, some systems are stochastic, in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.", "title": "Dynamical system"}
