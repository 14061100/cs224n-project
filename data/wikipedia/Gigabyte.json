{"summary": "A gigabyte , sometimes abbreviated as a gig, is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices.", "full_text": "The gigabyte  is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The prefix giga means 109 in the International System of Units , therefore one gigabyte is 1000000000bytes. The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB.\nThis definition is used in all contexts of science, engineering, business, and many areas of computing, including hard drive, solid state drive, and tape capacities, as well as data transmission speeds. However, the term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote 1073741824  bytes, particularly for sizes of RAM. The use of gigabyte is thus ambiguous. For semiconductor RAM, the gigabyte denotes 1073741824bytes. For hard drive capacities as described and marketed by the drive manufacturers, the gigabyte denotes 1000000000bytes, but when a 500-GB drive's capacity is displayed by, for example, Microsoft Windows, it is reported as 465 GB, where GB then means 1073741824bytes.\nTo address this ambiguity, the binary prefixes are standardized in the International System of Quantities, each binary prefix denoting an integer power of 1024. With these prefixes, a memory module that is labeled as having the size 1GB is designated as 1GiB .", "title": "Gigabyte"}
