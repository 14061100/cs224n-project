His work, along with that of fellow Briton Fred Vine and Canadian Lawrence Morley, showed how variations in the magnetic properties of rocks forming the ocean floor could be consistent with, and ultimately help confirm, Harry Hammond Hess's 1962 theory of seafloor spreading. In 1989 he was awarded the Geological Society of London's highest honour, the Wollaston Medal.\n^ White, R. S. . \"Drummond Hoyle Matthews. 5 February 1931 -- 20 July 1997: Elected F.R.S. 1974\".
