This may be done for ransom or in furtherance of another crime, or in connection with a child custody dispute.\nIn some countries such as the United States a large number of child abductions arise after separation or divorce when one parent wishes to keep a child against the will of the other or against a court order. In these cases, some jurisdictions do not consider it kidnapping if the child, being competent, agrees.", "title": "Kidnapping"}
