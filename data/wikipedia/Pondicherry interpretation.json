{"summary": "In quantum mechanics, the mathematical formalism is very difficult to interpret physically.", "full_text": "There is a diversity of views that propose interpretations of quantum mechanics. They vary in how many physicists accept or reject them. An interpretation of quantum mechanics is a conceptual scheme that proposes to relate the mathematical formalism to the physical phenomena of interest. The present article is about those interpretations which, independently of their intrinsic value, remain today less known, or are simply less debated by the scientific community, for different reasons.", "title": "Pondicherry interpretation"}
