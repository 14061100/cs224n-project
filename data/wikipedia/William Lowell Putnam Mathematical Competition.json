It awards a scholarship and cash prizes ranging from $250 to $2,500 for the top students and $5,000 to $25,000 for the top schools, plus one of the top five individual scorers  gets graduate tuition waived at Harvard , and the top 100 individual scorers have their names mentioned in the American Mathematical Monthly's October issue . It is widely considered to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics examination in the world, and its difficulty is such that the median score is often zero or one  despite being attempted by students specializing in mathematics.\nThe competition was founded in 1927 by Elizabeth Lowell Putnam in memory of her husband William Lowell Putnam, who was an advocate of intercollegiate intellectual competition. The exam has been offered annually since 1938 and is administered by the Mathematical Association of America.", "title": "William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition"}
