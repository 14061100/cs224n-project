{"summary": "Edmund Gerald \"Pat\" Brown, Sr.", "full_text": "Edmund Gerald \"Pat\" Brown, Sr.  was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 32nd Governor of California from 1959 to 1967. Born in San Francisco, Brown had an early interest in speaking and politics; he earned a law degree in 1927, and subsequently began legal practice. As district attorney for San Francisco, he was elected Attorney General of California in 1950 before becoming the state's Governor in 1959. As Governor, Brown embarked on massive projects building important infrastructure and redefined the state's higher education system. While running twice for President in 1960 and 1964, finishing second and first in the primaries, respectively, he was never a serious contender in the national conventions. While losing his bid for a third term in 1966 to future President Ronald Reagan, his legacy earns him regard as the builder of modern California. His son, Edmund G. 'Jerry' Brown, Jr., was and is the 34th and 39th Governor of California, and his daughter, Kathleen Brown, was the 29th California State Treasurer.", "title": "Pat Brown"}
