The group's debut album Girl You Know It's True achieved international success and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 21 February 1990. Milli Vanilli became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their success turned to infamy when the Grammy award was withdrawn after Morvan, Pilatus and their agent Sergio Vendero, confessed that Morvan and Pilatus did not actually sing the lead vocals on the record. The group recorded a comeback album in 1998, but Rob Pilatus died before the album was released.", "title": "Milli Vanilli"}
