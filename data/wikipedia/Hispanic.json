{"summary": "Hispanic  is a word that originally meant a relationship to Hispania.", "full_text": "The term Hispanic  broadly refers to the peoples, nations, and cultures that have a historical link to Spain. It commonly applies to countries once colonized by Spain, particularly the countries of Latin America. It could be argued that the term should apply to all Spanish-speaking cultures or countries, as the historical roots of the word specifically pertain to the Iberian region. It is difficult to label a nation or culture with one term, such as Hispanic, as the ethnicities, customs, traditions, and art forms  vary greatly by country and region. The Spanish language and Spanish culture are the main traditions.\nHispanic originally referred to the people of ancient Roman Hispania, which roughly comprised the Iberian Peninsula including the contemporary states of Spain, Portugal, Andorra and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar.", "title": "Hispanic"}
