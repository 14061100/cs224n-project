{"summary": "Tidal is the 1996 first album by Fiona Apple.", "full_text": "The stone put is one of the main Scottish heavy athletic events at modern-day Highland games gatherings. Similar to the shot put, the stone put more frequently uses an ordinary stone or rock instead of a steel ball. The weight of the stone will vary from 16 to 26 lb for men  depending on which type of stone put event  is being contested and also on the idiosyncrasies of the event . There are also some differences in allowable techniques and rules.\nRobert Burns was keen on stone putting and apparently left his favourite putting stone at Ellisland Farm near Dumfries. If he saw anyone using it whilst he lived there he would call \"Bide a wee\" and join in the sport, always proving that he was the strongest man there.", "title": "Stone put"}
