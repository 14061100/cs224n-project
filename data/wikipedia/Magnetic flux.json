{"summary": "Magnetic flux , is the number of magnetic field lines  passing through a closed surface .", "full_text": "In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux  through a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field B passing through that surface. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber  , and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics, that evaluates the change of voltage in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.", "title": "Magnetic flux"}
