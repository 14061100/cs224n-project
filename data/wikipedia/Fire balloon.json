{"summary": "The Manhattan Project was the program based in the United States which tried to make the first nuclear weapons.", "full_text": "A fire balloon , or Fu-Go , was a weapon launched by Japan during World War II. A hydrogen balloon with a load varying from a 15 kg  antipersonnel bomb to one 12-kilogram  incendiary bomb and four 5 kg  incendiary devices attached, it was designed as a cheap weapon intended to make use of the jet stream over the Pacific Ocean and drop bombs on American and Canadian cities, forests, and farmland.\nThe Japanese fire balloon was the first ever weapon possessing intercontinental range . The Japanese balloon strikes on North America were at that time the longest ranged attacks ever conducted in the history of warfare, a record which was not broken until the 1982 Operation Black Buck raids during the Falkland Islands War.\nThe balloons were relatively ineffective as weapons but were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II.", "title": "Fire balloon"}
