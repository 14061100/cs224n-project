{"summary": "Kenneth Howard Norton Sr.", "full_text": "Kenneth Howard Norton, Sr. , best known as Ken Norton, was an American professional boxer. He was the WBC world heavyweight champion from 1977 to 1978 and is best known for his trilogy with Muhammad Ali, in which he defeated Ali in their first bout by split decision over twelve rounds in March 1973. Their rematch also ended in a split decision, this time in favour of Ali. The third fight was won by Ali, but many observers thought Norton had won. He also is known for his slugfest with Larry Holmes in June 1978. Although he suffered quick knockout defeats to power punchers George Foreman, Earnie Shavers and Gerry Cooney, Norton always matched up well against top boxers and often gave opponents such as Ali, Jimmy Young and Holmes much trouble with his unorthodox style. In 1992, Norton was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He died of stroke complications at a care facility in Henderson, Nevada on September 18, 2013 at the age of 70.\n\n", "title": "Ken Norton"}
