{"summary": "Star formation means the earliest stages in a star's life.", "full_text": "Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular clouds in interstellar space, sometimes referred to as \"stellar nurseries\" or \"star-forming regions\", collapse to form stars. As a branch of astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium  and giant molecular clouds  as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its immediate products. It is closely related to planet formation, another branch of astronomy. Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary stars and the initial mass function.\nIn June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60. Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe , and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.", "title": "Star formation"}
