{"summary": "Signal processing is the analysis, interpretation and manipulation of signals.", "full_text": "The stochastic interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics.\nThe modern application of stochastics to quantum mechanics involves the assumption of spacetime stochasticity, the idea that the small-scale structure of spacetime is undergoing both metric and topological fluctuations , and that the averaged result of these fluctuations recreates a more conventional-looking metric at larger scales that can be described using classical physics, along with an element of nonlocality that can be described using quantum mechanics. A stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics due to persistent vacuum fluctuations is suggested by Roumen Tsekov. The main idea is that vacuum or spacetime fluctuations are the reason for quantum mechanics and not a result of it as it is usually considered.", "title": "Stochastic interpretation"}
