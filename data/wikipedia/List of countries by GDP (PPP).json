The GDP dollar  estimates given on this page are derived from purchasing power parity  calculations.\nComparisons using PPP are arguably more useful when assessing a nation's domestic market as well as the structure of its economy because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates which may distort the real differences in per capita income. It is however limited when comparing the size of national economies; GDP PPP is designed to compare the purchasing power of the citizens of one country against those of another country rather than the total size of national economies. It could be argued that purchasing power and economic size are not very closely related and hence relying upon GDP PPP when comparing national economies, as opposed to the metric's intended purpose of comparing citizens' consumption of goods and services, can create distortions. For this reason, PPP is often used to gauge global poverty thresholds and is used by the United Nations in constructing the human development index.\nTim Callen of the International Monetary Fund  outlined the general difference and usefulness of PPP over market rates, with essentially PPP being a better measure for assessing the cost of living, well-being of a country's population, and measuring non traded goods and services within a country.\nEconomies do self-adjust to currency changes over time, and technology intensive and luxury goods, raw materials and energy prices are mostly unaffected by difference in currency , however this is taken into account by the price comparison surveys, such as the International Comparison Program, which are used as the basis for PPP calculations. These surveys include both tradable and non-tradable goods in an attempt to estimate a representative basket of all goods.\nThe first table includes data for the year 2014 for all current 187 International Monetary Fund  members, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan . Data are in millions of international dollars and were calculated by the IMF. Figures were published in April 2015. The second table includes data mostly for the year 2014 for 180 of the 193 current United Nations member states, as well as the two Chinese Special Administrative Regions . Data are in billions of international dollars and were compiled by the World Bank. The third table is a tabulation of the CIA World Factbook Gross Domestic Product   data update of 2013. The data for GDP at purchasing power parity have also been rebased using the new International Comparison Program price surveys and extrapolated to 2007. Final figures are estimates in millions of international dollars.", "title": "List of countries by GDP (PPP)"}
