{"summary": "Neutrinos are a type of elementary particle that exist all across the universe.", "full_text": "A Majorana fermion , also referred to as a Majorana particle, is a fermion that is its own antiparticle. They were hypothesized by Ettore Majorana in 1937. The term is sometimes used in opposition to a Dirac fermion, which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.\nAll of the Standard Model fermions except the neutrino behave as Dirac fermions at low energy , but the  nature of the neutrino is not settled and it may be either Dirac or Majorana. In condensed matter physics, Majorana fermions exist as quasiparticle excitations in superconductors and can be used to form Majorana bound states governed by non-abelian statistics.", "title": "Majorana fermion"}
