{"summary": "In the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell published equations that describe how charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic force per unit charge.", "full_text": "An electromagnetic four-potential is a relativistic vector function from which the electromagnetic field can be derived. It combines both an electric scalar potential and a magnetic vector potential into a single four-vector. \nAs measured in a given frame of reference, and for a given gauge, the first component of the electromagnetic four-potential is the electric scalar potential, and the other three components make up the magnetic vector potential. While both the scalar and vector potential depend upon the frame, the electromagnetic four-potential is Lorentz covariant.\nLike other potentials, many different electromagnetic four-potentials correspond to the same electromagnetic field, depending upon the choice of gauge.\nIn this article, index notation and the Minkowski metric  will be used, see also Ricci calculus, covariance and contravariance of vectors and raising and lowering indices for more details on notation. Formulae are given in SI units and Gaussian-cgs units.", "title": "4-potential"}
