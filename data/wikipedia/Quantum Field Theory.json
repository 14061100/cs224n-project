{"summary": "Kenneth Geddes Wilson  was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.", "full_text": "In theoretical physics, quantum field theory  is a theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. A QFT treats particles as excited states of an underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.\nIn quantum field theory, quantum mechanical interactions between particles are described by interaction terms between the corresponding underlying fields.", "title": "Quantum field theory"}
