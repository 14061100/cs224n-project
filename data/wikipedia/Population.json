{"summary": "A population is the number of living things that live together in the same place.", "full_text": "A population is a summation of all the organisms of the same group or species, which live in a particular geographical area, and have the capability of interbreeding.\nIn ecology, the population of a certain species in a certain area is estimated using the Lincoln Index. The area that is used to define a sexual population is defined as the area where inter-breeding is potentially possible between any pair within the area. The probability of interbreeding is greater than the probability of cross-breeding with individuals from other areas. Under normal conditions, breeding is substantially more common within the area than across the border.\nIn sociology, population refers to a collection of humans. Demography is a social science which entails the statistical study of human populations. This article refers mainly to human population.", "title": "Population"}
