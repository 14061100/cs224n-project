{"summary": "An honorary degree or a degree honoris causa  is an academic degree given by a university to a person who particularly deserves such an honour.", "full_text": "An honorary degree or a degree honoris causa  is an academic degree for which a university  has waived the usual requirements, such as matriculation, residence, study and the passing of examinations. The degree is typically a doctorate or, less commonly, a master's degree, and may be awarded to someone who has no prior connection with the academic institution. An example of identifying receipt of this award is as follows: Doctorate in Business Administration .\nThe degree is often conferred as a way of honouring a distinguished visitor's contributions to a specific field or to society in general. It is often given to graduation speakers at a university or college, and the university may derive benefits by association with the person in question. The degree is not recognized by employers as having the same stature as a corresponding earned doctorate degree and should not be represented as such. It is sometimes recommended that such degrees be listed in one's CV as an award, and not in the education section. With regard to the use of this honorific, the policies of institutions of higher education generally ask that recipients \"refrain from adopting the misleading title\" and that a recipient of an honorary doctorate's use of the title \"Dr\" before their name should be restricted to engagement with the institution of higher education in question and not within the broader community.", "title": "Honoris causa"}
