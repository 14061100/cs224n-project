{"summary": "Admiral Arthur Phillip RN  was a British naval officer.", "full_text": "Admiral Arthur Phillip RN  was a Royal Navy officer, the first Governor of New South Wales and founder of the British penal colony that later became the city of Sydney, Australia.\nAfter much experience at sea, Phillip sailed with the First Fleet as Governor-designate of the proposed British penal colony of New South Wales. In January 1788, he selected its location to be Port Jackson .\nPhillip was a far-sighted governor who soon saw that New South Wales would need a civil administration and a system for emancipating the convicts. But his plan to bring skilled tradesmen on the voyage had been rejected, and he faced immense problems of labour, discipline and supply. Also his friendly attitude towards the aborigines was sorely tested when they killed his gamekeeper, and he was not able to assert a clear policy about them.\nThe arrival of the Second and Third Fleets placed new pressures on the scarce local resources, but by the time Phillip sailed home in December 1792, the colony was taking shape, with official land-grants and systematic farming and water-supply.\nPhillip retired in 1805, but continued to correspond with his friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests.", "title": "Arthur Phillip"}
