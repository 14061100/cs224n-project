Due to the success of the movie and the continued popularity of the character, there have been many Superman-based games released since.\nOver the years, video games based on Superman have attained a reputation for being of low quality. The most prevalent example of this is the 1999 Nintendo 64 Superman game which is considered to be one of the worst video games ever made.
