{"summary": "1991  was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Say It With Poison  is a whodunnit or mystery novel by Ann Granger. It is the first in a series of 15  Mitchell and Markby Mysteries.\nAlthough they feel curiously attracted to each other, the two protagonists who solve the case, Mitchell and Markby, are not a team. Rather, they work against each other. Meredith Mitchell, aged 35 at the beginning of the series, is a British civil servant who, unmarried and without relatives to take care of, embarks on a career in the diplomatic service and, at the beginning of the novel, has spent many years abroad, most recently in Yugoslavia. On her arrival back home, she metamorphoses into an amateur sleuth. Chief Inspector Alan Markby is a 42-year-old divorced policeman working from the fictitious town of Bamford somewhere in the Cotswolds. The two meet when the police have to investigate a death in a small village near Bamford where Mitchell is staying.\nGranger is renowned for writing traditional detective fiction but also for bringing the classic whodunnit up to date. As opposed to, say, Miss Marple's St. Mary Mead, the village of Westerfield is a soulless place with a dwindling population, with all the young people leaving. There is no village shop; no village school; no doctor's practice; no vicarage, with the old church boarded up and only to be opened for special occasions. In spite of all that, the villagers are reluctant to accept, and suspicious of, any newcomers to their rural community.", "title": "Say It With Poison"}
