{"summary": "2005  was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time  in order to keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1. Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation. Since this system of correction was implemented in 1972, 26 leap seconds have been inserted, the most recent on June 30, 2015 at 23:59:60 UTC.\nThe UTC time standard, which is widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries, uses the international system  definition of the second, based on atomic clocks. Like most time standards, UTC defines a grouping of seconds into minutes, hours, days, months, and years. However, the duration of one mean solar day is now slightly longer than 24 hours  because the rotation of the Earth has slowed down. Therefore, if the UTC day were defined as precisely 86400 SI seconds, the UTC time-of-day would slowly drift apart from that of solar-based standards, such as Greenwich Mean Time  and its successor UT1. The purpose of a leap second is to compensate for this drift, by occasionally scheduling some UTC days with 86401 or  86399 SI seconds.\nSpecifically, a positive leap second is inserted between second 23:59:59 of a chosen UTC calendar date  and second 00:00:00 of the following date. This extra second is displayed on UTC clocks as 23:59:60. On clocks that display local time tied to UTC, the leap second may be inserted at the end of some other hour , depending on the local time zone. A negative leap second would suppress second 23:59:59 of the last day of a chosen month, so that second 23:59:58 of that date would be followed immediately by second 00:00:00 of the following date. However, negative leap seconds have never been needed since the UTC standard was established, and are highly unlikely to ever be.\nBecause the Earth's rotation speed varies in response to climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly spaced and unpredictable. Insertion of each UTC leap second is usually decided about six months in advance by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service , when needed to ensure that the difference between the UTC and UT1 readings will never exceed 0.9 seconds. 26 positive leap seconds have been scheduled so far.", "title": "Leap Second"}
