{"summary": "Positronium is a type of exotic atom that is made of one positron and one electron.", "full_text": "This article is about the exotic atom. For the hydrogen isotope, see Protium.\n\nPositronium  is a system consisting of an electron and its anti-particle, a positron, bound together into an exotic atom, specifically an onium. The system is unstable: the two particles annihilate each other to predominantly produce two or three gamma-rays, depending on the relative spin states. The orbit and energy levels of the two particles are similar to that of the hydrogen atom . However, because of the reduced mass, the frequencies of the spectral lines are less than half of the corresponding hydrogen lines.", "title": "Positronium"}
