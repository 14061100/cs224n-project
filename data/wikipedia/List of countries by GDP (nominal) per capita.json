{"summary": "This is a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product .", "full_text": "This article includes four lists of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product per capita at nominal values. This is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market exchange rates to current U.S. dollars, divided by the average  population for the same year.\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\nTherefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living; although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries.  PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\nNon-sovereign entities  are included in the list because they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. They are marked in italics.\nAll data are in current United States dollars.", "title": "List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita"}
