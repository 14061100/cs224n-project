W. Woolworth Company and the operator of variety stores known as \"Five-and-Dimes\"  or dimestores, which featured a low-priced selection of merchandise. He pioneered the now-common practices of buying merchandise directly from manufacturers and fixing the selling prices on items, rather than haggling. He was also the first to use self-service display cases, so customers could examine what they wanted to buy without the help of a sales clerk.", "title": "F.W. Woolworth"}
