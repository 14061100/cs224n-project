{"summary": "The Great Walls are the largest known structures in the universe.", "full_text": "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major multi-filter imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The project was named after the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which contributed significant funding.\nData collection began in 2000, and the final imaging data release covers over 35% of the sky, with photometric observations of around 500 million objects and spectra for more than 3 million objects. The main galaxy sample has a median redshift of z = 0.1; there are redshifts for luminous red galaxies as far as z = 0.7, and for quasars as far as z = 5; and the imaging survey has been involved in the detection of quasars beyond a redshift z = 6.\nData release 8 , released in January 2011, includes all photometric observations taken with the SDSS imaging camera, covering 14,555 square degrees on the sky . Data release 9 , released to the public on 31 July 2012, includes the first results from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey  spectrograph, including over 800,000 new spectra. Over 500,000 of the new spectra are of objects in the Universe 7 billion years ago . Data release 10 , released to the public on 31 July 2013, includes all data from previous releases, plus the first results from the APO Galactic Evolution Experiment  spectrograph, including over 57,000 high-resolution infrared spectra of stars in the Milky Way. DR10 also includes over 670,000 new BOSS spectra of galaxies and quasars in the distant universe. The publicly available images from the survey were made between 1998 and 2009.", "title": "Sloan Digital Sky Survey"}
