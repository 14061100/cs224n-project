{"summary": "Profanity is the act of using swear words.", "full_text": "Profanity, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is \"an offensive word\" or \"offensive language\". It is also called bad language, strong language, coarse language, foul language, bad words, vulgar language, lewd language, swearing, cursing, cussing, or using expletives. This use is a subset of a language's lexicon that is generally considered to be strongly impolite, rude or offensive. It can show a debasement of someone or something, or show intense emotion. Profanity in this sense takes the form of words or verbal expressions that fall into the category of formulaic language.\nIn its older, more literal sense, the term \"profanity\" refers to \"offensive words, or religious words\", used in a way that shows the user does not respect \"God or holy things\", or behaviour showing similar disrespect.", "title": "Profanity"}
