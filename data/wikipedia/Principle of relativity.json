{"summary": "In the Physics of Aristotle, heavy objects fall faster than objects that are not heavy.", "full_text": "In physics, the principle of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing the laws of physics have the same form in all admissible frames of reference.\nFor example, in the framework of special relativity the Maxwell equations have the same form in all inertial frames of reference. In the framework of general relativity the Maxwell equations or the Einstein field equations have the same form in arbitrary frames of reference.\nSeveral principles of relativity have been successfully applied throughout science, whether implicitly  or explicitly .", "title": "Principle of relativity"}
