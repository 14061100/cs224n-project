{"summary": "Numerical analysis studies different algorithms to get approximations for problems of mathematical analysis.", "full_text": "Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation  for the problems of mathematical analysis .\nOne of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection , which gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of , the length of the diagonal in a unit square. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle  is extremely important, for instance, in astronomy, carpentry and construction.\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of , modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.\nNumerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century also the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics ; numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.\nBefore the advent of modern computers numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations.", "title": "Numerical analysis"}
