{"summary": "The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a unique commercial book identifier barcode.", "full_text": "The International Standard Book Number  is a unique numeric commercial book identifier.\nAn ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation  of a book. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\nThe initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering  created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization  and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 .\nOccasionally, a book may appear without a printed ISBN if it is printed privately or the author does not follow the usual ISBN procedure; however, this can be rectified later.\nAnother identifier, the International Standard Serial Number , identifies periodical publications such as magazines; and the International Standard Music Number  covers for musical scores.", "title": "International Standard Book Number"}
