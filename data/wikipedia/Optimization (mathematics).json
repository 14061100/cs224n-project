{"summary": "Mathematics, sometimes shortened to maths  or math  is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns.", "full_text": "In mathematics, computer science and operations research, mathematical optimization  is the selection of a best element  from some set of available alternatives.\nIn the simplest case, an optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function. The generalization of optimization theory and techniques to other formulations comprises a large area of applied mathematics. More generally, optimization includes finding \"best available\" values of some objective function given a defined domain , including a variety of different types of objective functions and different types of domains.", "title": "Optimization (mathematics)"}
