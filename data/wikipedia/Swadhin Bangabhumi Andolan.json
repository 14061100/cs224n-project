{"summary": "Bangabhumi  also known as Bir Bango , is a separatists movement to create a Hindu country using southwestern East Bengal envisioned by Banga Sena of Bangladesh.", "full_text": "Bongobhumi  also known as Bir Bongo , is a separatist movement to create a Hindu country using southwestern Bangladesh, envisioned by Banga Sena of Bangladesh.\n\nThe movement was founded in 1973 in India soon after independence of Bangladesh to support the Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, who were targeted by the Pakistan Army in the 1971 Bangladesh atrocities based on ideas of reconquest. However, this movement did not receive much support at that time. In an interview with BBC in 2001, Chittaranjan Sutar, one of the alleged organisers of the movement, denied any existence of the movement at the time. The movement openly became active again on 4th February, 2003 when it declared the independence of Hindu Republic of Bangabhumi.\nThe flag of the proposed Bangabhumi state comprises one third green color and two thirds saffron color. In the middle of the saffron part is a white disc symbolizing the sun. Although the meaning is not explained, one can assume the green part would represent the Muslim minority in otherwise Hindu state, something like the Flag of Pakistan does with their minorities. The National Emblem is depicted by the green circle in another, saffron colored circle with word \"Shri\"  written in the saffron circle. The National Anthem is a song of poet Dwijendralal Ray, \"Dhana Dhanye Pushpe Bhara, Arnader Ei Basundhara\" .", "title": "Swadhin Bangabhumi Andolan"}
