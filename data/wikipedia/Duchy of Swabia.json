{"summary": "Eastern Francia  was the land of Louis the German after the Treaty of Verdun of 843. That treaty divided Carolingian Empire of the Franks into an East, West, and Middle.", "full_text": "The Duchy of Swabia  was one of the five stem duchies of the medieval German kingdom, and its dukes were thus among the most powerful magnates of Germany.\nSwabia takes its name from the tribe of the Suebi, and the name was often used interchangeably with Alemannia during the existence of the stem-duchy in the High Middle Ages. Dwelling in the angle formed by the Rhine and the Danube, they were joined by other tribes, and were called Alamanni, until about the 11th century, when the form Swabia began to prevail.\nThe duchy was proclaimed by Burchard II in 917. Burchard had allied himself with king Conrad I and defeated his rivals for the rule of Alemannia in a battle at Wahlwies in 915.\nThe most notable family to hold Swabia were the Hohenstaufen, who held it, with a brief interruption, from 1079 until 1268. For much of this period, the Hohenstaufen were also Holy Roman Emperors.\nThe duchy persisted until 1268, ending with the execution of Conradin, the last duke of Swabia. Rudolph I of Germany in 1273 attempted to revive the title of duke of Swabia, bestowing it on his youngest son, the later Rudolf II, who passed it to his son John Parricida. John died without an heir, in 1312 or 1313, marking the end of the \"revived\" title.\nThe Margraviate of Baden detached itself from the duchy in the 12th century.", "title": "Duchy of Swabia"}
