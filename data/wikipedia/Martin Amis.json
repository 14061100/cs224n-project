{"summary": "Martin Amis  is a Welsh novelist.", "full_text": "Martin Louis Amis  is an English novelist. His best-known novels are Money  and London Fields . He has received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his memoir Experience and has been listed for the Booker Prize twice to date . Amis served as the Professor of Creative Writing at the Centre for New Writing at the University of Manchester until 2011. In 2008, The Times named him one of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.\nAmis's work centres on the apparent excesses of late-capitalist Western society, whose perceived absurdity he often satirises through grotesque caricature; he has been portrayed as a master of what the New York Times called \"the new unpleasantness\". Inspired by Saul Bellow, Vladimir Nabokov, and James Joyce, as well as by his father Kingsley Amis, Amis himself went on to influence many successful British novelists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including Will Self and Zadie Smith.", "title": "Martin Amis"}
