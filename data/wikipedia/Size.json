{"summary": "The size of something is how much space the thing takes.", "full_text": "Size refers to the concept of things, usually physical objects, having measurements that are relatively greater or lesser than other things along certain dimensions in physical space, such as length, width, height, diameter, perimeter, area, volume, or mass. In mathematical terms, \"ize is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter\". Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established scale, such as meters or inches.\nThe sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions , which include measures such as human height, the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body standing erect, and human body weight. These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes. The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size chauvinism, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.\n\n", "title": "Size"}
