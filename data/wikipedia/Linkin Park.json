The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns , layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things , combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth and most recent album, The Hunting Party , returned to a heavier rock sound.
