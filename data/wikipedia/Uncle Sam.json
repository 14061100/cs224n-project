{"summary": "Uncle Sam was first featured on a poster during World War I.", "full_text": "Uncle Sam  is a common national personification of the American government or the United States in general that, according to legend, came into use during the War of 1812 and was supposedly named for Samuel Wilson but whose actual origin may be obscure. Uncle Sam represents a manifestation of patriotic emotion .\nThe first use of Uncle Sam in formal literature, as distinct from newspapers, was in the 1816 allegorical book \"The Adventures of Uncle Sam in Search After His Lost Honor\" by Frederick Augustus Fidfaddy, Esq. An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original \"Yankee Doodle\" lyrics of the American Revolutionary War. It is not clear whether this reference is to Uncle Sam as a metaphor for the United States, or to an actual person named Sam. The lyrics as a whole clearly deride the military efforts of the young nation, besieging the British at Boston. The 13th stanza is:\nOld Uncle Sam come there to change\nSome pancakes and some onions,\nFor 'lasses cakes, to carry home\nTo give his wife and young ones.", "title": "Uncle Sam"}
