{"summary": "A group in the Periodic Table is any column of elements with common properties denoted by the electrons in the outermost layer.", "full_text": "In chemistry, a group  is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table, but the f-block columns  are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristic of the outermost electron shells of their atoms , as most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron. There are three systems of group numbering. The modern numbering group 1 to group 18 is recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry . It replaces two older naming schemes that were mutually confusing. Also, groups may be identified by their topmost element or have a specific name. For example, group 16 is variously described as oxygen group and chalcogen.", "title": "Group (periodic table)"}
