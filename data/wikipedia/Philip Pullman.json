For the 70th anniversary of the Medal it was named one of the top ten winning works by a panel, composing the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. Northern Lights won the public vote from that shortlist and was thus named the all-time \"Carnegie of Carnegies\" on 21 June 2007. It has been adapted as a film under its U.S. title, The Golden Compass.", "title": "Philip Pullman"}
