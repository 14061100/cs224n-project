{"summary": "A license  allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do.", "full_text": "The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun license  or licence  refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission.\nA license may be granted by a party  to another party  as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is \"an authorization  to use the licensed material .\"\nIn particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee and/or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.\nA licensor may grant a license under intellectual property laws to authorize a use  to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor. A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.\nTerm: many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.\nTerritory: a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to \"North America\"  would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.\nA shorthand definition of license is \"a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee.\" That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.\nIntellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing  and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.\n^ See, for instance, the British Government's webpage \"Open Government Licence for public sector information\".
