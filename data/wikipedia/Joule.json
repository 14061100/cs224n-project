{"summary": "A joule  is a unit in the SI system.", "full_text": "The joule , symbol J, is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred  to an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre . It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule .\nIn terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units:\n\nwhere kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt.\nOne joule can also be defined as:\nThe work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one '\"coulomb volt\" . This relationship can be used to define the volt.\nThe work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one \"watt second\"  . This relationship can be used to define the watt.", "title": "Joule"}
