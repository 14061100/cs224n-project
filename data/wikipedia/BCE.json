{"summary": "Common Era  is the calendar system commonly used in the Western world for the year number part of a date.", "full_text": "Common Era  is a calendar era used with the Gregorian calendar and Julian calendar that is often used as an alternative naming of the Anno Domini system . The system uses BCE as an abbreviation for before the Common  Era and CE as an abbreviation for in the Common Era. The CE/BCE designation uses the year-numbering system introduced by the 6th-century Christian monk Dionysius Exiguus, who started the Anno Domini designation, intending the supposed beginning of the life of Jesus to be the reference date. Neither notation includes a year zero, and the two notations  are numerically equivalent; thus \"2015 CE\" corresponds to \"AD 2015\", and \"400 BCE\" corresponds to \"400 BC\".\nThe expression \"Common Era\" can be found as early as 1708 in English, and traced back to Latin usage among European Christians to 1615, as vulgaris aerae, and to 1635 in English as Vulgar Era. At those times, the expressions were all used interchangeably with \"Christian Era\". The Gregorian calendar and the year-numbering system associated with it is the calendar system with most widespread use in the world today. For decades, it has been the global standard, recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations and the Universal Postal Union.\nUse of the CE abbreviation was introduced by Jewish academics in the mid-19th century. Since the later 20th century, use of CE and BCE has been popularized in academic and scientific publications and more generally by authors and publishers wishing to emphasize secularism and/or sensitivity to non-Christians, because it does not explicitly make use of religious titles for Jesus, such as \"Christ\" and Dominus , which are used in the BC/AD notation, nor does it give implicit expression to the Christian creed that Jesus was the Christ.", "title": "BCE"}
