{"summary": "Upper Canada College  is a private lower grades and high school for boys in Toronto, Canada.", "full_text": "The Province of Upper Canada  was a part of British Canada established in 1791 by the United Kingdom to govern the central third of the lands in British North America and to accommodate Loyalist refugees of the United States after the American Revolution. The new province remained, for the next fifty years of growth and settlement, the colonial government of the territory.\nUpper Canada existed from 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841 and generally comprised present-day Southern Ontario. The \"upper\" prefix in the name reflects its geographic position being closer to the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River than that of Lower Canada  to the northeast.\nUpper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the Pays d'en Haut which had formed part of New France, essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior .", "title": "Upper Canada"}
