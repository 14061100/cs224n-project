Heavily influenced by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of the society. The most common pop culture categories are: entertainment , sports, news , politics, fashion/clothes, technology and slang.\nPopular culture is often viewed as being trivial and \"dumbed down\" in order to find consensual acceptance throughout the mainstream. As a result, it comes under heavy criticism from various non-mainstream sources  which deem it superficial, consumerist, sensationalist, or corrupt.", "title": "Popular culture"}
