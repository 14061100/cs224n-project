{"summary": "Solids mostly expand in response to heating and contract on cooling.", "full_text": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in shape, area, and volume in response to a change in temperature, through heat transfer.\nTemperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance. When a substance is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases. Thus, the molecules begin moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation. Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges . The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature.", "title": "Coefficient of thermal expansion"}
