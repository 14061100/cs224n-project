{"summary": "The Nobel Prize in Physics is a Nobel Prize in the science of Physics.", "full_text": "Johannes Diderik van der Waals  was a Dutch theoretical physicist and thermodynamicist famous for his work on an equation of state for gases and liquids.\nHis name is primarily associated with the van der Waals equation of state that describes the behavior of gases and their condensation to the liquid phase. His name is also associated with van der Waals forces , with van der Waals molecules , and with van der Waals radii .\nHe became the first physics professor of the University of Amsterdam when in 1877 the old Athenaeum was upgraded to Municipal University. Van der Waals won the 1910 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids.", "title": "Johannes Diderik van der Waals"}
