{"summary": "A plebiscite or referendum is a type of voting, or of proposing laws.", "full_text": "A referendum  is a direct vote in which an entire electorate is asked to vote on a particular proposal. This may result in the adoption of a new law.\nSome definitions of plebiscite suggest that it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country. Others define it as the opposite. Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution. In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one 'plebiscite' which was the vote to adopt its constitution and each other similar vote has been styled a 'referendum'.\n\n", "title": "Referendum"}
