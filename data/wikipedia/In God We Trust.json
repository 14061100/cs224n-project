Many people  have expressed objections to its use, and have sought to have the religious reference removed from the currency, claiming that it violates the First Amendment.\n\"In God we trust\" first appeared on U.S. coins in 1864 and has appeared on paper currency since 1957. A law passed in a Joint Resolution by the 84th Congress  and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower on July 30, 1956 declared IN GOD WE TRUST must appear on currency. This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1, 1957 \nIt is also the motto of the U.S. state of Florida.
