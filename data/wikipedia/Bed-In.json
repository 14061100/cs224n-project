{"summary": "A bed is a piece of furniture that people sleep on.", "full_text": "As the Vietnam War raged in 1969, Yoko Ono and her husband John Lennon held two week-long Bed-Ins for Peace, one at the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam and one in Montreal, each of which were intended to be non-violent protests against wars, and experimental tests of new ways to promote peace. The idea is derived from a \"sit-in\", in which a group of protesters remains seated in front of an establishment until they are evicted, arrested, or their demands are met.\nThe public proceedings were filmed, and later turned into a documentary movie. The film Bed Peace was made available for free on YouTube in August 2011 by Yoko Ono, as part of her website \"Imagine Peace\".", "title": "Bed-In"}
