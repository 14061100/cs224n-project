{"summary": "Death penalty, also called capital punishment, is when a government or state executes  someone, usually but not always because they have committed a serious crime.", "full_text": "Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is \"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \"hanging\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. In this specialised meaning of the common word hang, the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung.\nHanging is also a method of suicide in which a person applies a ligature to the neck and brings about unconsciousness and then death by suspension. Partial suspension or partial weight-bearing on the ligature is sometimes used, particularly in prisons, mental hospitals or other institutions, where full suspension support is difficult to devise, because high ligature points  have been removed.", "title": "Hanging"}
