{"summary": "The Alps  is the greatest mountain range of Europe.", "full_text": "The Alpine region of Switzerland, conventionally referred to as the Swiss Alps , represents a major natural feature of the country and is, along with the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss portion of the Jura Mountains, one of its three main physiographic regions. The Swiss Alps extend over both the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps, encompassing an area sometimes called Central Alps. While the northern ranges from the Bernese Alps to the Appenzell Alps are entirely in Switzerland, the southern ranges from the Mont Blanc massif to the Bernina massif are shared with other countries such as France, Italy, Austria and Liechtenstein.\nThe Swiss Alps comprise all the mountains of Switzerland over 2,000 metres above sea level and almost all the highest mountains of the Alps, such as Monte Rosa , the Dom , the Lyskamm , the Weisshorn  and the Matterhorn . The other following major summits can be found in List of mountains of Switzerland.\nSince the Middle Ages, transit across the Alps played an important role in history. The region north of the St. Gotthard Pass became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century.\n^ Ball, John . The Central Alps. Longmans, Green & Co.", "title": "Swiss Alps"}
