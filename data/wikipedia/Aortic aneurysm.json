{"summary": "An aortic aneurysm is a general term for an enlargement  of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size.", "full_text": "An aortic aneurysm is enlargement  of the aorta to greater than 1.5 times normal size. They usually cause no symptoms except when ruptured. Occasionally there may be abdominal, back or leg pain.\nThey are most commonly located in the abdominal aorta, but can also be located in the thoracic aorta. Aortic aneurysms cause weakness in the wall of the aorta and increase the risk of aortic rupture. When rupture occurs, massive internal bleeding results and, unless treated immediately, shock and death can occur.\nScreening with ultrasound is indicated in those at high risk. Prevention is by decreasing risk factors such as smoking. Treatment is either by open or endovascular surgery. Aortic aneurysms resulted in about 152,000 deaths in 2013, up from 100,000 in 1990.", "title": "Aortic aneurysm"}
