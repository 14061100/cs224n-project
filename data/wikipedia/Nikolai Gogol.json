{"summary": "Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol   was a Ukrainian writer.", "full_text": "Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol  was a Russian dramatist, novelist and short story writer of Ukrainian ethnicity. Russian and Ukrainian scholars debate whether or not Gogol was of their respective nationalities.\nConsidered by his contemporaries one of the preeminent figures of the natural school of Russian literary realism, later critics have found in Gogol's work a fundamentally romantic sensibility, with strains of Surrealism and the grotesque . His early works, such as Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka, were influenced by his Ukrainian upbringing, Ukrainian culture and folklore. His later writing satirised political corruption in the Russian Empire , leading to his eventual exile. The novel Taras Bulba  and the play Marriage , along with the short stories \"Diary of a Madman\", \"The Tale of How Ivan Ivanovich Quarreled with Ivan Nikiforovich\", \"The Portrait\" and \"The Carriage\", round out the tally of his best-known works.", "title": "Nikolai Gogol"}
