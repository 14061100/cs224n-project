{"summary": "The Hanukkah menorah, or hanukiah, is a nine-branch lamp used to celebrate, remember, and honor the miracle of Hanukkah.", "full_text": "The Hanukkah menorah or chanukiah   is a nine-branched candelabrum lit during the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah, as opposed to the seven-branched menorah used in the ancient Temple or as a symbol. On each night of Hanukkah a new branch is lit. The ninth holder, called the shamash , is for a candle used to light all other candles and/or to be used as an extra light. To be kosher the shamash must be offset on a higher or lower plane than the main eight candles or oil lamps.\nThere are differing opinions as to whether or not all the lights must be arranged in a straight line, or if the channukiah can be arranged in a curve. The menorah is among the most widely produced articles of Jewish ceremonial art. The seven-branched menorah is a traditional symbol of Judaism, along with the Star of David.", "title": "Menorah (Hanukkah)"}
