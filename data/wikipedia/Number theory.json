{"summary": "Number theory is a part of mathematics.", "full_text": "Number theory or arithmetic is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the natural numbers and the integers. It is sometimes called \"The Queen of Mathematics\" because of its foundational place in the discipline. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers  or defined as generalizations of the integers .\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations . Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects  that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion . One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, e.g., as approximated by the latter .\nThe older term for number theory is arithmetic. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".  The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence. In particular, arithmetical is preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.", "title": "Number theory"}
