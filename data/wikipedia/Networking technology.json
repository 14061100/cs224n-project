{"summary": "It is possible to connect a number of computers and other electronic devices to create a computer network.", "full_text": "The gigabit is a multiple of the unit bit for digital information or computer storage. The prefix giga  is defined in the International System of Units  as a multiplier of 109 , and therefore\n1 gigabit = 109bits = 1000000000bits.\nThe gigabit has the unit symbol Gbit or Gb.\nUsing the common byte size of 8 bits, 1 Gbit is equal to 125 megabytes  or approximately 119 mebibytes .\nThe gigabit is closely related to the gibibit, a unit multiple derived from the binary prefix gibi  of the same order of magnitude, which is equal to 230bits = 1073741824bits, or approximately 7% larger than the gigabit.", "title": "Networking technology"}
