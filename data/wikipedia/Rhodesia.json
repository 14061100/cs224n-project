{"summary": "Rhodesia was an unrecognized state in Southern African during the Cold War.", "full_text": "Rhodesia , commonly known from 1970 onwards as the Republic of Rhodesia, was an unrecognised state in southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territorial terms to modern Zimbabwe. With its capital in Salisbury , Rhodesia was considered a de facto successor state to the former British colony of Southern Rhodesia .\nDuring an effort to delay an immediate transition to black majority rule, Rhodesia's predominantly white government issued its own Unilateral Declaration of Independence  from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The UDI administration initially sought recognition as an autonomous realm within the Commonwealth of Nations, but reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970.\nFollowing a brutal guerrilla war fought with two communist-backed African nationalist organisations , Rhodesian premier Ian Smith conceded to bi-racial democracy in 1978. However, a provisional government subsequently headed by Smith and his moderate colleague Abel Muzorewa failed in appeasing international critics or halting the bloodshed.\nBy December 1979, Muzorewa had replaced Smith as Prime Minister and secured an agreement with the militant nationalists, allowing Rhodesia to briefly revert to colonial status pending elections under a universal franchise. It finally achieved internationally recognised independence in April 1980; the nation was concurrently renamed the Republic of Zimbabwe.\nA wholly landlocked area, Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south, Bechuanaland  to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique  to the east. The state was named after Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company acquired the land in the late 19th century.\n\n", "title": "Rhodesia"}
