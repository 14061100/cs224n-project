The President of Austria is directly elected by universal adult suffrage once in every six years. The president's offices are located in the Leopoldine Wing of the Hofburg Imperial Palace, in Vienna.\nMany former Presidents have gained tremendous popularity while in office, and no incumbent has ever lost a bid for re-election, though Waldheim didn't participate for another term. Five Presidents died in office and all former presidents are deceased. Since 2004 the office is occupied by social democrat Heinz Fischer.", "title": "President of Austria"}
