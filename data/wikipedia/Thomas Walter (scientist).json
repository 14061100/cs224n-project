{"summary": "Walter Rudolf Hess  was a Swiss physiologist.", "full_text": "Mad scientist  is a caricature of a scientist who is described as \"mad\" or \"insane\" owing to a combination of unusual or unsettling personality traits and the unabashedly ambitious, taboo and/or hubristic nature of their experiments. As a motif in fiction, the mad scientist may be villainous  or antagonistic, benign or neutral; may be insane, eccentric, or clumsy; and often works with fictional technology or fails to recognize or value common human objections to attempting to play God. Some may have benevolent or good-spirited intentions, even if their actions are dangerous or questionable, which can make them accidental villains. Some are protagonists or allies thereof, such as Dexter in the animated series Dexter's Laboratory; Professor Calculus in The Adventures of Tintin; Dr. Muto; Professor Farnsworth on Futurama; Philo in UHF; Dr. Benjamin Jeffcoat of My Secret Identity; Emmett Brown of Back to the Future; Rick Sanchez of Rick and Morty; Dr. Walter Bishop of Fringe; or Okabe Rintarou from the anime series Steins;Gate. Occasionally, there are parodies of mad scientists making fun of this trope.", "title": "Thomas Walter (scientist)"}
