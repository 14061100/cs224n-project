{"summary": "Willows are a family of trees and shrubs which have many differences in size and type of growth, but are very much alike in other respects.", "full_text": "Willows, also called sallows, and osiers, form the genus Salix, around 400 species of deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called osier, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as sallow . Some willows  are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow  rarely exceeds 6 cm  in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.", "title": "Willow"}
