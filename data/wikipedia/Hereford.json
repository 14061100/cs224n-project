{"summary": "Hereford  Welsh: Henffordd  is a city and civil parish in the West Midlands of England, close to the border with Wales and on the River Wye.", "full_text": "Hereford  is a cathedral city, civil parish and county town of Herefordshire, England. It lies on the River Wye, approximately 16 miles  east of the border with Wales, 24 miles  southwest of Worcester, and 23 miles  northwest of Gloucester. With a population of 53,516 people, it is the largest settlement in the county.\nThe name \"Hereford\" is said to come from the Anglo-Saxon \"here\", an army or formation of soldiers, and the \"ford\", a place for crossing a river. If this is the origin it suggests that Hereford was a place where a body of armed men forded or crossed the Wye. The Welsh name for Hereford is Henffordd, meaning \"old road\", and probably refers to the Roman road and Roman settlement at nearby Stretton Sugwas.\nAn early town charter from 1189 granted by Richard I of England describes it as \"Hereford in Wales\". Hereford has been recognised as a city since time immemorial, with the status being reconfirmed as recently as October 2000.\nIt is now known chiefly as a trading centre for a wider agricultural and rural area. Products from Hereford include: cider, beer, leather goods, nickel alloys, poultry, chemicals, and cattle, including the famous Hereford breed.", "title": "Hereford"}
