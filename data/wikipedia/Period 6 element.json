{"summary": "A period 6 element is an element in the sixth period  of the periodic table.", "full_text": "A period 6 element is one of the chemical elements in the sixth row  of the periodic table of the elements, including the lanthanides. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring  trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The sixth period contains 32 elements, tied for the most with period 7, beginning with caesium and ending with radon. Lead is currently the last stable element; all subsequent elements are radioactive, however bismuth has a half-life of more than 1019 years, more than 1,000 times longer than the current age of the universe. As a rule, period 6 elements fill their 6s shells first, then their 4f, 5d, and 6p shells, in that order, however there are exceptions, such as cerium.", "title": "Period 6 element"}
