{"summary": "The nucleus is the center of an atom.", "full_text": "A nuclide  is an atomic species characterized by the specific constitution of its nucleus, i.e., by its number of protons Z, its number of neutrons N, and its nuclear energy state.\nThe word nuclide was proposed by Truman P. Kohman in 1947. Kohman originally suggested nuclide as referring to a \"species of nucleus\" defined by containing a certain number of neutrons and protons. The word thus was originally intended to focus on the nucleus.", "title": "Nuclide"}
