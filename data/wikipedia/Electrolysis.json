{"summary": "Electrolysis is a scientific way of \"splitting\" substances.", "full_text": "In chemistry and manufacturing, electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current  to drive an otherwise non-spontaneous chemical reaction. Electrolysis is commercially highly important as a stage in the separation of elements from naturally occurring sources such as ores using an electrolytic cell. The voltage that is needed for electrolysis to occur is called the decomposition potential.", "title": "Electrolysis"}
