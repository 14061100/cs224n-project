{"summary": "In physics, centrifugal force  is a fictitious force that appears when describing physics in a rotating reference frame; it acts on anything with mass considered in such a frame.", "full_text": "In Newtonian mechanics, the term centrifugal force is used to refer to an inertial force  that appears to act on all objects when viewed in a rotating reference frame, drawing them away from the axis.\nThe concept of centrifugal force can be applied in rotating devices such as centrifuges, centrifugal pumps, centrifugal governors, centrifugal clutches, etc., as well as in centrifugal railways, planetary orbits, banked curves, etc. when they are analyzed in a rotating coordinate system.\nThe name has historically sometimes also been used to refer to the reaction force to the centripetal force.", "title": "Centrifugal force"}
