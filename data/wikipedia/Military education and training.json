{"summary": "Militarism or militarist ideology is a view on society.", "full_text": "Military education and training is a process which intends to establish and improve the capabilities of military personnel in their respective roles.\nMilitary education can be voluntary or compulsory duty. Before any person gets authorization to operate technical equipment or be on the battlefield, they must take a medical and often a physical examination. If passed, they may begin primary training.\nThe primary training is recruit training. Recruit training attempts to teach the basic information and training in techniques necessary to be an effective service member.\nTo achieve this, service members are drilled physically, technically and psychologically. The drill instructor has the task of making the service members fit for military use.\nAfter finishing basic training, many service members undergo advanced training more in line with their chosen or assigned specialties. In advanced training, military technology and equipment is often taught.\nMany large countries have several military academies, one for each branch of the service, that offer college degrees in a variety of subjects, similar to other colleges. However, academy graduates usually rank as officers, and as such have many options besides civilian work in their major subject. Higher-ranking officers also have further educational opportunities.", "title": "Military education and training"}
