{"summary": "Roman Vishniac   was a Russian-American photographer and a biologist.", "full_text": "Roman Vishniac  was a Russian-American photographer, best known for capturing on film the culture of Jews in Central and Eastern Europe before the Holocaust. A major archive of his work now rests at the International Center of Photography.\nVishniac was a versatile photographer, an accomplished biologist, an art collector and teacher of art history. He also made significant scientific contributions to photomicroscopy and time-lapse photography. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors, and strongly attached to his Jewish roots; he was a Zionist later in life.\nRoman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photos of shtetlach and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and microscopic biology. His book A Vanished World, published in 1983, made him famous and is one of the most detailed pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in the 1930s. Vishniac was also remembered for his humanism and respect for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work.\nIn August 2014, the International Center for Photography in New York City announced that 9,000 of Vishniac's photos, many never printed or published before, would be posted in an online database.", "title": "Roman Vishniac"}
