Williams is often counted as being among a group of four major American poets who were all born in a twelve-year period that began in 1874. The group also consists of Robert Frost, who was born in 1874; Wallace Stevens, who was born in 1879; and Hilda \"H.D.\" Doolittle, who was born in 1886. Of these four, Williams died last, several weeks after Frost. .\nIn addition to his writing, Williams had a long career as a physician practicing both pediatrics and general medicine. He was affiliated with what was then known as Passaic General Hospital in Passaic, New Jersey, where he served as the hospital's chief of pediatrics from 1924 until his death. The hospital, which is now known as St. Mary's General Hospital, pays tribute to Williams with a memorial plaque that states \"we walk the wards that Williams walked\".", "title": "William Carlos Williams"}
