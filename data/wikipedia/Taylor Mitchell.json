Her debut album, For Your Consideration received encouraging reviews and airplay. Following a busy summer performance schedule, which included an appearance as a young performer at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, Mitchell embarked on a tour of Eastern Canada with a newly acquired licence and car. She died, aged 19, of blood loss after coyotes bit her while she was walking in Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Although coyotes were known to be capable of preying on large animals, they were thought to be apprehensive of people and not a serious threat. Mitchell's death was the first recorded fatality from an attack on an adult. It shocked experts and led to a reassessment of the risk to humans from coyotes' predation behaviour.", "title": "Taylor Mitchell"}
