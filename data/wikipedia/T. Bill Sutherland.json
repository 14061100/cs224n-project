{"summary": "Donald McNichol Sutherland OC  is a Canadian actor.", "full_text": "Bill Sutherland  is a notable American theoretical physicist. He received his PhD in 1968 while studying under Nobel laureate C. N. Yang at Stony Brook. He is best known for his work in statistical mechanics and quantum many body theory. Early in his career he solved the six vertex model and developed an exact solution in 1967, which he then followed with the eight vertex model in 1970. He completed his postdoctoral work at Berkeley in the 1969-1971 time frame where he became interested in inverse square potential many body interactions. He then became a professor of physics at the University of Utah in 1971 where he worked until his retirement in 2004. Most notably his name is associated with the Calogero-Sutherland model which is a major research area in theoretical physics and mathematics.\n^ Bill Sutherland at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\n^ Baxter, Rodney J. , Exactly solved models in statistical mechanics, London: Academic Press Inc. , ISBN 978-0-12-083180-7, MR 690578", "title": "T.
