{"summary": "Jewish ethics refers to the philosophical tradition of ethics in Judaism.", "full_text": "Jewish ethics are considered to be at the intersection of Judaism and the Western philosophical tradition of ethics. Like other types of religious ethics, the diverse literature of Jewish ethics primarily aims to answer a broad range of moral questions and, hence, may be classified as a normative ethics. For two millennia, Jewish thought has also grappled with the dynamic interplay between law and ethics. The tradition of rabbinic religious law  addresses numerous problems often associated with ethics, including its semi-permeable relation with duties that are usually not punished under law.", "title": "Jewish ethics"}
