{"summary": "Clarence Leonidas Fender , also known as Leo Fender, was an American instrument maker.", "full_text": "Clarence Leonidas \"Leo\" Fender  was an American inventor who founded Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company, or \"Fender\" for short. In January 1965, he sold the company to CBS and later founded two other musical instrument companies, Music Man and G&L Musical Instruments.\nThe guitars, bass guitars, and amplifiers he designed from the 1940s on are still relevant: the Fender Telecaster  was the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar; the Fender Stratocaster  is among the world's most iconic electric guitars; the Fender Precision Bass  set the standard for electric bass guitars, and the Fender Bassman amplifier, popular enough in its own right, became the basis for later amplifiers  that dominated rock and roll music. Leo Fender was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 - a unique achievement given that he never learned to play the instruments which he made a career of building.", "title": "Leo Fender"}
