{"summary": "Alan Samuel Colmes  is an American radio/television host, former comedian and author.", "full_text": "All-news radio is a radio format devoted entirely to the discussion and broadcast of news.\nAll-news radio is available in both local and syndicated forms, and is carried in some form on both major US satellite radio networks. All-news stations can run the gamut from simulcasting an all-news television station like CNN, to a \"rip and read\" headline service, to stations that include live coverage of news events and long-form public affairs programming.\nMany stations brand themselves Newsradio but only run continuous news during the morning and afternoon drive times. These stations are properly labeled as \"news/talk\" talk radio stations. Also, some National Public Radio stations identify themselves as News and Information stations, which means that in addition to running the NPR news magazines like Morning Edition and All Things Considered, they run other information and public affairs programs.", "title": "News radio"}
