{"summary": "Bankruptcy is a legal process which happens when a person or an organisation does not have enough money to pay all of its debts.", "full_text": "Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or other entity that cannot repay the debts it owes to creditors. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a court order, often initiated by the debtor.\nBankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person or other entity may have, and the term bankruptcy is therefore not a synonym for insolvency. In some countries, including the United Kingdom, bankruptcy is limited to individuals, and other forms of insolvency proceedings  are applied to companies. In the United States, bankruptcy is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings.", "title": "Bankruptcy"}
