{"summary": "Professor Albert Fert is a French physicist who was born on March 7 1938. He discovered giant magnetoresistance which was used to make gigabyte hard disks much easier to build.", "full_text": "Spintronics , also known as spinelectronics or fluxtronics, is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its associated magnetic moment, in addition to its fundamental electronic charge, in solid-state devices.\nSpintronics differs from the older magnetoelectronics, in that spins are manipulated by both magnetic and electrical fields.", "title": "Spintronics"}
