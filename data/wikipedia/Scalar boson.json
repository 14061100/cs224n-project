{"summary": "Scalar is a concept meaning relating to a directionless magnitude  that is completely specified by its magnitude.", "full_text": "A scalar boson is a boson whose spin equals zero. Boson means that it has an integer-valued spin; the scalar fixes this value to 0.\nThe name \"scalar boson\" arises from quantum field theory. It refers to the particular transformation properties under Lorentz transformation.", "title": "Scalar boson"}
