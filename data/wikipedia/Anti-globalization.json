{"summary": "Anti-globalization is used for people and groups who oppose certain aspects of globalization in its present form.", "full_text": "The anti-globalization movement, or counter-globalisation movement, is a social movement critical of the globalization of corporate capitalism. The movement is also commonly referred to as the global justice movement, alter-globalization movement, anti-globalist movement, anti-corporate globalization movement, or movement against neoliberal globalization.\nParticipants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas. What is shared is that participants oppose what they see as large, multi-national corporations having unregulated political power, exercised through trade agreements and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards, labor hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. As of January 2012, some commentators have characterized the unprecedented changes in the global economy as \"turbo-capitalism\" , \"market fundamentalism\" , \"casino capitalism\" , and as \"McWorld\" .\nMany anti-globalization activists call for forms of global integration that better provide democratic representation, advancement of human rights, fair trade and sustainable development and therefore feel the term \"anti-globalization\" is misleading.", "title": "Anti-globalization"}
