{"summary": "A common year is a year that is not a leap year.", "full_text": "A Common year is a calendar year with exactly 365 days, in contrast to the longer leap year. More generally, a common year is one without intercalation. The Gregorian calendar  employs both common years and leap years to adjust for differing astronomical measurements of the year: sidereal and tropical.\nThe common year of 365 days has exactly 52 weeks and one day, hence a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week. . In a common year, February has exactly four weeks, so that month and March always start consecutively on the same day of the week.\nIn the Gregorian calendar, 303 of every 400 years are common years. By comparison, in the Julian calendar, 300 out of every 400 years were common years.\nIn the Lunisolar calendar and the Lunar calendar, a common year consists of 354 days.", "title": "Common year"}
