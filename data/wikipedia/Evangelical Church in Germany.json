{"summary": "The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany  is a series of 20 regional churches.", "full_text": "The Evangelical Church in Germany  is a federation of twenty Lutheran, Reformed  and United  Protestant regional and denominational churches in Germany, collectively encompassing the majority of Protestants in that country. The EKD is not a church in a theological understanding, because of its denominational differences.\nIn 2012, the EKD had a membership of 23,356,096 church-goers, or 29.0% of the German population. It constitutes one of the largest national Protestant bodies in the world, behind the Church of England and Church of Christ in Congo.\nFormed in 1948, the Evangelical Church has undergone a split as a result of tensions between West and East Germany in 1969. The EKD did not merge back until 1991.\nThe member churches , while being independent and having their own theological and formal organisation, share full pulpit and altar fellowship, are united in the EKD synod, and are individual members of the World Council of Churches  and the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe . Boundaries of EKD churches within Germany partially resemble those of the states of the Holy Roman Empire and successor forms of German statehood, due to the historical close relationship between individual German states and churches.\nAs for church governance, the Lutheran churches typically practise an Episcopal polity, while the Reformed and the United ones a mixture of Presbyterian and Congregationalist polities. Most member churches are led by a  bishop. Only one member church, the Evangelical Reformed Church, is not restricted to a certain territory. In some ways, the other member churches resemble dioceses of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, from an organisational point of view.", "title": "Evangelical Church in Germany"}
