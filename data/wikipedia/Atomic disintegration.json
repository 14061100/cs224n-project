{"summary": "Sir James Chadwick CH FRS,  was an English physicist and Nobel Prize winner who is best known for discovering the neutron.", "full_text": "The measurement of ionizing radiation is sometimes expressed as being a rate of counts per unit time registered by a radiation monitoring instrument, of which counts per minute  and counts per second  are commonly used. Count rate measurements are normally associated with the detection of particles, such as alpha particles and beta particles. However, for gamma ray and X-ray dose measurements a unit such as the sievert is normally used.\nBoth cpm and cps are the rate of detection events registered by the measuring instrument, not the rate of emission from the source of radiation. For radioactive decay measurements it must not be confused with disintegrations per unit time , which represents the rate of atomic disintegration events at the source of the radiation.", "title": "Atomic disintegration"}
