{"summary": "A father  is a male parent.", "full_text": "A father is the male parent of a  child. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the baby, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption. As a parent, the father has a social and legal relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations, although this varies between jurisdictions. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support. A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.\nThe adjective \"paternal\" refers to a father and comparatively to \"maternal\" for a mother. The verb \"to father\" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun \"fathering\". Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome , or Y chromosome . Related terms of endearment are dad , papa/pappa , papasita,  and pop. A male role-model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a\nfather-figure.\n^ HUMAN GENETICS, MENDELIAN INHERITANCE retrieved 25 February 2012", "title": "Father"}
