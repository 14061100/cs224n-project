{"summary": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a bacterium which causes strep throat.", "full_text": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a species of bacteria. Like most other streptococci, it is clinically important in human illness. It is an infrequent, but usually pathogenic, part of the skin flora. It is the sole species of Lancefield group A and is often called group A streptococcus , because it displays streptococcal group A antigen on its cell wall. Group A streptococcal infection can cause illness, which typically produces small zones of beta-hemolysis, a complete destruction of red blood cells. . It is thus also called group A  streptococcus .\nLike other cocci, streptococci are round bacteria. The name derives from the Greek word streptos, meaning twisted chain, because streptococcal cells tend to link together in chains, which resemble a string of pearls when viewed under the microscope. Streptococci are catalase-negative and Gram-positive. S. pyogenes can be cultured on blood agar plates. Under ideal conditions, it has an incubation period of 1 to 3 days.\nAn estimated 700 million GAS infections occur worldwide each year. While the overall mortality rate for these infections is 0.1%, over 650,000 of the cases are severe and invasive, and have a mortality rate of 25%. Early recognition and treatment are critical; diagnostic failure can result in sepsis and death.", "title": "Streptococcus pyogene"}
