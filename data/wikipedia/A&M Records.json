A&M was formerly an independent label founded by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss  in 1962.\nDue to the success A&M released, the label garnered interest and was acquired by PolyGram in 1989 and began distributing releases from Polydor Ltd. from the UK. Throughout its operations, A&M housed well-known acts such as Sting, Bryan Adams, Burt Bacharach, Liza Minnelli, The Carpenters, Paul Williams, Janet Jackson, Cat Stevens, Carole King, Joan Baez, The Police, CeCe Peniston, and Sheryl Crow.\nAs PolyGram was acquired by Seagram and dissolved into Universal Music Group in 1998, A&M's operations were ceased in January 1999 when it was merged with Geffen and Interscope Records to form the record company Interscope Geffen A&M Records. In 2007, Interscope announced that the A&M name was revived and was to be merged with Octone Records to form A&M Octone Records which operated until 2013, when A&M Octone was folded into Interscope.\nToday, A&M's catalog releases are managed by Verve Records, Universal Music Enterprises and Interscope.\n\n", "title": "A&M Records"}
