{"summary": "The computer memory is a temporary storage area.", "full_text": "In computing, memory refers to the computer hardware devices used to store information for immediate use in a computer; it is synonymous with the term \"primary storage\". Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory , as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access program and data storage but offers higher capacities. If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage, through a memory management technique called \"virtual memory\". An archaic synonym for memory is store.\nThe term \"memory\", meaning \"primary storage\" or \"main memory\", is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory, i.e. integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors, used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other digital electronic devices. There are two main types of semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile. Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory  and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory . Examples of volatile memory are primary storage , and fast CPU cache memory .\nMost semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bistable flip-flops, each storing one bit . Flash memory organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multiple bits per cell . The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length, for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bit. Each word can be accessed by a binary address of N bit, making it possible to store 2 raised by N words in the memory. This implies that processor registers normally are not considered as memory, since they only store one word and do not include an addressing mechanism.\nTypical secondary storage devices are hard disk drives and solid-state drives.", "title": "Computer memory"}
