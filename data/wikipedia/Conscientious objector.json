{"summary": "A conscientious objector  is a person who decides not to be a combatant in military forces.", "full_text": "A conscientious objector is an \"individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service\" on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, disability, and/or religion. In general, conscientious objector status is only considered in the context of military conscription and is not applicable to volunteer military forces.\nIn some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative civilian service as a substitute for conscription or military service. Some conscientious objectors consider themselves pacifist, non-interventionist, non-resistant, non-aggressionist, or antimilitarist.\nThe international definition of conscientious objection officially broadened on March 8, 1995 when the United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1995/83 stated that \"persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service.\" That definition was re-affirmed in 1998, when the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights document called \"Conscientious objection to military service, United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77\" officially recognized that \"persons  performing military service may develop conscientious objections.\". A number of organizations around the world celebrate the principle on May 15 as International Conscientious Objectors Day. The term has also been extended to objecting to working for the military-industrial complex due to a crisis of conscience.", "title": "Conscientious objector"}
