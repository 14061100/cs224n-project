{"summary": "Conjugate variables are special pairs of variables  that do not commute, If two variables, let us call them m and n, commute, then mn = nm.", "full_text": "Conjugate variables are pairs of variables mathematically defined in such a way that they become Fourier transform duals of one another, or more generally are related through Pontryagin duality. The duality relations lead naturally to an uncertainty in physics called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relation between them. In mathematical terms, conjugate variables are part of a symplectic basis, and the uncertainty principle corresponds to the symplectic form.", "title": "Conjugate variables"}
