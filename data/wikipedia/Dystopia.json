{"summary": "A dystopia is the opposite of a utopia, and can mean a utopia that has become corrupt.", "full_text": "A dystopia  is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening. It is translated as \"not-good place\", an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his most well-known work, \"Utopia.\" \"Utopia\" is the blueprint for an ideal society with no crime or poverty. Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in a future. Some of the most famous examples are 1984 and Brave New World. Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization, totalitarian governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many subgenres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, and/or technology, which if unaddressed could potentially lead to such a dystopia-like condition.", "title": "Dystopia"}
