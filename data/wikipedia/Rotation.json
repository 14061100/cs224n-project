{"summary": "`Rotation is the movement of an object in a circular motion.", "full_text": "A rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center  of rotation . A three-dimensional object always rotates around an imaginary line called a rotation axis. If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity.", "title": "Rotation"}
