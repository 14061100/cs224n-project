{"summary": "Category theory is a type of mathematics.", "full_text": "Category theory formalizes mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a collection of objects and of arrows . A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively and the existence of an identity arrow for each object. Category theory can be used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings, and groups.\nSeveral terms used in category theory, including the term \"morphism\", are used differently from their uses in the rest of mathematics. In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.", "title": "Category theory"}
