{"summary": "Murray Bookchin  was an American libertarian socialist, political and social philosopher, speaker and writer.", "full_text": "Murray Bookchin  was an American anarchist and libertarian socialist author, orator, historian, and political theoretician. A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin initiated the critical theory of social ecology within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were Our Synthetic Environment , Post-Scarcity Anarchism  and The Ecology of Freedom . In the late 1990s he became disenchanted with the increasingly apolitical lifestylism of the contemporary anarchist movement  and stopped referring to himself as an anarchist. Instead, he founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called Communalism.\nBookchin was an anti-capitalist and vocal advocate of the decentralisation of society along ecological and democratic lines. His writings on libertarian municipalism, a theory of face-to-face, assembly democracy, had an influence on the Green movement and anti-capitalist direct action groups such as Reclaim the Streets, as well as the democratic confederalism of Rojava.", "title": "Murray Bookchin"}
