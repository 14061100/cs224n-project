{"summary": "Saint Patrick  is the patron saint of Ireland and Nigeria.", "full_text": "Saint Patrick  was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Known as the \"Apostle of Ireland\", he is the primary patron saint of Ireland, along with Saints Brigit and Columba. He is also venerated in the Orthodox Church as Equal-to-the-Apostles.\nThe dates of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty but, on a widespread interpretation, he was active as a missionary in Ireland during the second half of the fifth century. He is generally credited with being the first bishop of Armagh, Primate of Ireland.\nAccording to the Confessio of Patrick, when he was about 16, he was captured by Irish pirates from his home in Great Britain, and taken as a slave to Ireland, looking after animals, where he lived for six years before escaping and returning to his family. After becoming a cleric, he returned to northern and western Ireland. In later life, he served as an ordained bishop, but little is known about the places where he worked. By the seventh century, he had already come to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.\nSaint Patrick's Day is observed on 17 March, which is said to be the date of his death. It is celebrated inside and outside Ireland as a religious and cultural holiday. In the dioceses of Ireland, it is both a solemnity and a holy day of obligation; it is also a celebration of Ireland itself.", "title": "Saint Patrick"}
