{"summary": "Some types of distilled alcoholic drinks are also called spirits .", "full_text": "The English word spirit  has many different meanings and connotations, most of them relating to a non-corporeal substance contrasted with the material body. It can also refer to a \"subtle\" as opposed to \"gross\" material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica.\nThe word spirit is often used metaphysically to refer to the consciousness or personality. The notions of a person's spirit and soul often also overlap, as both contrast with body and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions, and \"spirit\" can also have the sense of \"ghost\", i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person.\nThe term may also refer to any incorporeal or immaterial being, such as demons or deities. In the Bible, \"the Spirit\" , specifically denotes the Holy Spirit.", "title": "Spirits"}
