{"summary": "Greed is a desire to have more goods, or more wealth than is needed.", "full_text": "Greed , also known as avarice, cupidity, or covetousness, is the inordinate desire to possess wealth, goods, or objects of abstract value with the intention to keep it for one's self, far beyond the dictates of basic survival and comfort. It is applied to a markedly high desire for and pursuit of wealth, status, and power.\nAs secular psychological concept, greed is, similarly, an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs. The degree of inordinance is related to the inability to control the reformulation of \"wants\" once desired \"needs\" are eliminated. Erich Fromm described greed as \"a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction.\" It is typically used to criticize those who seek excessive material wealth, although it may apply to the need to feel more excessively moral, social, or otherwise better than someone else.\nThe purpose for greed, and any actions associated with it, is possibly to deprive others of potential means  or future opportunities accordingly, or to obstruct them therefrom, as a measure of enhanced discretion via majority belongings-having and majority competitive advantage, thus insidious and tyrannical or otherwise having negative connotation. Alternately, the purpose could be defense or counteraction from such dangerous, potential leverage in matters of questionable agreeability. A consequence of greedy activity may be inability to sustain any of the costs or burdens associated with that which has been or is being accumulated, leading to a backfire or destruction, whether of self or more generally. So, the level of \"inordinance\" of greed pertains to the amount of vanity, malice or burden associated with it.", "title": "Greed"}
