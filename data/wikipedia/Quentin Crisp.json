He then spent thirty years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style.

Crisp possessed a contrarian streak, criticising both gay liberation and Diana, Princess of Wales.", "title": "Quentin Crisp"}
