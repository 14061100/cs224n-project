{"summary": "Evangelism is the Christian practice of preaching about Jesus Christ to both Christians and non-Christians.", "full_text": "Evangelism is the preaching of the gospel or the practice of giving information about a particular doctrine or set of beliefs to others with the intention of converting others to the Christian faith.\nThis term is not restricted to any particular Christian tradition, and should not be confused with Evangelicalism, a common term for a wide range of \"Evangelical\" Protestant churches and groups.\nChristians who specialize in evangelism are often known as evangelists, whether they are in their home communities or living as missionaries in the field, although some Christian traditions refer to such people as missionaries in either case. Some Christian traditions consider evangelists to be in a leadership position; they may be found preaching to large meetings or in governance roles.\nChristian groups who actively encourage evangelism are sometimes known as evangelistic or evangelist. The scriptures do not use the word evangelism, but evangelist is used in  Acts 21:8, Ephesians 4:11, and 2 Timothy 4:5.", "title": "Evangelism"}
