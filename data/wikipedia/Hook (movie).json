{"summary": "Hook is a 1991 American fantasy-comedy movie directed by Steven Spielberg.", "full_text": "Hook is a 1991 American fantasy adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Pan/Peter Banning, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Smee, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy, Caroline Goodall as Moira Banning, and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning. The film acts as a sequel to J. M. Barrie's 1911 novel Peter and Wendy and poses the question \"What if Peter Pan grew up?\", focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten his childhood. In his new life, Peter Pan is known as Peter Banning, a successful corporate lawyer with a wife  and two children. However, when the enemy of his past, Hook, kidnaps his children, Peter once again returns to Neverland in order to save his children and along the journey unknowingly reclaims his youthful spirit.\nSpielberg began developing the film in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Productions and Paramount Pictures, which would have followed the storyline seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film. Peter Pan entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. James V. Hart developed the script with director, Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. Hook was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, and while it was a commercial success, its box office intake was lower than expected. Hook was nominated in five categories at the 64th Academy Awards. It also spawned merchandise, including video games, action figures, and comic book adaptations.\n^ Joseph McBride .
