{"summary": "Physical chemistry uses physics to study chemical systems.", "full_text": "Physical chemistry is the study of macroscopic, atomic, subatomic, and particulate phenomena in chemical systems in terms of laws and concepts of physics. It applies the principles, practices and concepts of physics such as motion, energy, force, time, thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics and dynamics, equilibrium.\nPhysical chemistry, in contrast to chemical physics, is predominantly  a macroscopic or supra-molecular science, as the majority of the principles on which physical chemistry was founded are concepts related to the bulk rather than on molecular/atomic structure alone. For example, chemical equilibrium, and colloids.\nSome of the relationships that physical chemistry strives to resolve include the effects of:\nIntermolecular forces that act upon the physical properties of materials .\nReaction kinetics on the rate of a reaction.\nThe identity of ions and the electrical conductivity of materials.\nSurface chemistry and electrochemistry of membranes.\nInteraction of one body with another in terms of quantities of heat and work called thermodynamics.\nTransfer of heat between a chemical system and its surroundings during change of phase or chemical reaction taking place called thermochemistry\nStudy of colligative properties of number of species present in solution.\nNumber of phases, number of components and degree of freedom  can be correlated with one another with help of phase rule.\nReactions of electrochemical cells.", "title": "Physical chemistry"}
