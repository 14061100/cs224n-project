{"summary": "A Lieutenant is an officers rank in the military, police and fire departments.", "full_text": "A lieutenant  is a junior commissioned officer in many nations' armed forces, fire service, or law enforcement.\nThe meaning of lieutenant differs in different military formations , but is often subdivided into senior  and junior  ranks. In navies it is often equivalent to the army rank of captain; it may also indicate a particular post rather than a rank. The rank is also used in fire services, emergency medical services, security services and police forces.\nLieutenant may also appear as part of a title used in various other organizations with a codified command structure. It often designates someone who is \"second-in-command,\" and as such, may precede the name of the rank directly above it. For example, a \"lieutenant master\" is likely to be second-in-command to the \"master\" in an organization using both ranks.\nPolitical uses include lieutenant governor in various governments, and Quebec lieutenant in Canadian politics. In the United Kingdom, a lord lieutenant is the sovereign's representative in a county or lieutenancy area, while a deputy lieutenant is one of the lord lieutenant's deputies.", "title": "Lieutenant"}
