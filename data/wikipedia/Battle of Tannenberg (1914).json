{"summary": "The Battle of Tannenberg was a decisive engagement between the Russian Empire and the German Empire in the first days of World War I.", "full_text": "The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from August 26th to August 30th 1914, during the first month of World War I. The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov. A series of follow-up battles  destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915. The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages. It brought high prestige to Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff.\nAlthough the battle actually took place near Allenstein , Hindenburg named it after Tannenberg, 30 km to the west, to avenge the defeat of the Teutonic Knights at the earlier battle of that name in 1410.", "title": "Battle of Tannenberg (1914)"}
