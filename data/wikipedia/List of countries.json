{"summary": "This is a list of sovereign states.", "full_text": "This list of sovereign states provides an overview of sovereign states around the world, with information on their status and recognition of their sovereignty.\nMembership within the United Nations system divides the 206 listed states into three categories: 193 member states, two observer states, and 11 other states. The sovereignty dispute column indicates states whose sovereignty is undisputed  and states whose sovereignty is disputed .\nCompiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. For more information on the criteria used to determine the contents of this list, please see the criteria for inclusion section below. The list is intended to include entities that have been recognized to have de facto status as sovereign states, and inclusion should not be seen as an endorsement of any specific claim to statehood in legal terms.", "title": "List of countries"}
