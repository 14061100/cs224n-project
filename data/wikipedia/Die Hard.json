{"summary": "Die Hard is a 1988 American action movie starring Bruce Willis.", "full_text": "Die Hard is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steven E. de Souza and Jeb Stuart. It follows off-duty New York City Police Department officer John McClane  as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber , who perform a heist in a Los Angeles skyscraper under the guise of a terrorist attack using hostages, including McClane's wife Holly , to keep the police at bay.\nIt is based on Roderick Thorp's 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, the sequel to 1966's The Detective, which was adapted into a 1968 film of the same name that starred Frank Sinatra. Fox was contractually obliged to offer Sinatra the lead role in Die Hard, but he turned it down. The studio then pitched the film to Arnold Schwarzenegger as a sequel to his 1985 action film Commando, who turned it down, as did a host of the era's action stars, and finally and reluctantly gave it to Willis, then known primarily as a comedic television actor.\nMade for $28 million, Die Hard grossed over $140 million theatrically worldwide, and received a positive reception from critics. The film turned Willis into an action star, became a metonym for an action film in which a lone hero fights overwhelming odds, and is now widely considered one of the greatest action movies ever made. The film's success spawned the Die Hard franchise, which includes four sequels, video games, and a comic book.", "title": "Die Hard"}
