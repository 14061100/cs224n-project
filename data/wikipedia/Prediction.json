{"summary": "A prediction is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen.", "full_text": "A prediction , or forecast, is a statement about the way things will happen in the future. It is often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. While there is much overlap between prediction and forecast, a prediction may be a statement that some outcome is expected, while a forecast is more specific, and may cover a range of possible outcomes. A \"prediction\" may be contrasted with a \"projection\", which is explicitly dependent on stated assumptions.\nAlthough guaranteed accurate information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction can be useful to assist in making plans about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business \"... is at least two things: Important and hard.\"\n^ Stevenson, Howard, ed. Do lunch or be lunch.
