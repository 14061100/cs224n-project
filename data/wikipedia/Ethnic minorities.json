{"summary": "Tatars are a Turkic-speaking ethnic group.", "full_text": "Minority group is a term referring to a category of people differentiated from the social majority, i.e. those who hold the majority of positions of social power in a society, and may be defined by law. Rather than a relational \"social group\", as the term would indicate, minority group refers to the above-described. The differentiation can be based on one or more observable human characteristics, including, but not limited to: ethnicity, race, caste, gender, wealth, health or sexual orientation. Usage of the term is applied to various situations and civilizations within history, despite its popular mis-association with a numerical, statistical minority. In the social sciences, the term \"minority\" is used to refer to categories of persons who hold fewer positions of social power.\nThe term \"minority group\" often occurs alongside a discourse of civil rights and collective rights which gained prominence in the 20th century. Members of minority groups are prone to different treatment in the countries and societies in which they live. This discrimination may be directly based on an individual's perceived membership of a minority group, without consideration of that individual's personal achievement. It may also occur indirectly, due to social structures that are not equally accessible to all. Activists campaigning on a range of issues may use the language of minority rights, including student rights, consumer rights, and animal rights.\nExamples of minorities are the Romani people  and Jews in Europe and the African Americans and Mexicans in the United States.", "title": "Ethnic minorities"}
