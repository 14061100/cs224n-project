{"summary": "The Federal Republic of Germany, also called Germany , is a country in Central Europe.", "full_text": "Germany has had a very different kind of economics. Economics basically mean the way a country uses it's recourse to produce wealth. Germany before 1800 was heavily rural, with some urban trade centers. In the 19th century it began a stage of rapid economic growth and modernization, led by heavy industry. By 1900 it had the largest economy in Europe, a factor that played a major role in its entry into World War I and World War II. Devastated by World War II, West Germany became an \"economic miracle\" in the 1950s and 1960s with the help of the Marshall Plan. Currently it is the largest individual economy in the EU with GDP of roughly 3 trillion USD.\n\n", "title": "Economic history of Germany"}
