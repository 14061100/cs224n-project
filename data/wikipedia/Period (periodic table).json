{"summary": "A period in the Periodic Table is any horizontal row of elements.", "full_text": "In the periodic table of the elements, elements are arranged in a series of rows  so that those with similar properties appear in a column. Elements of the same period have the same number of electron shells; with each group across a period, the elements have one more proton and electron and become less metallic. This arrangement reflects the periodic recurrence of similar properties as the atomic number increases. For example, the alkaline metals lie in one group  and share similar properties, such as high reactivity and the tendency to lose one electron to arrive at a noble-gas electronic configuration. The periodic table of elements has a total of 118 elements.\n\nModern quantum mechanics explains these periodic trends in properties in terms of electron shells. As atomic number increases, shells fill with electrons in approximately the order shown at right. The filling of each shell corresponds to a row in the table.\nIn the s-block and p-block of the periodic table, elements within the same period generally do not exhibit trends and similarities in properties . However in the d-block, trends across periods become significant, and in the f-block elements show a high degree of similarity across periods.", "title": "Period (periodic table)"}
