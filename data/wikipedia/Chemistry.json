{"summary": "Chemistry is a branch of science that deals with chemical elements and compounds, and how these things work together.", "full_text": "Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry deals with such topics as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.\nChemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other natural sciences, including physics, geology and biology. For the differences between chemistry and physics see Comparison of chemistry and physics.\nScholars disagree about the etymology of the word chemistry. The history of chemistry can be traced to alchemy, which had been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world.", "title": "Chemistry"}
