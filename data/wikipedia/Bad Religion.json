The band makes extensive use of soaring 3-part vocal harmonies , guitar solos and lyrics that often contain religious and political commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three of the band's four original members . To date, Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs  and two DVDs . They are one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over 5 million albums worldwide.\nBad Religion had built an underground following in the United States with their early albums before they signed to Atlantic Records in 1993, and rose to fame that same year with their seventh studio album Recipe for Hate, which peaked at number 14 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart. Recipe for Hate was followed a year later by Stranger than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and a re-recorded version of \"21st Century \", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to focus on his label Epitaph, and was replaced by Brian Baker. Since the return of Gurewitz in 2001, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their sixteenth studio album True North  becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked at number 19. The band is expected to release their seventeenth studio album around 2017.", "title": "Bad Religion"}
