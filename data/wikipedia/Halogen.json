{"summary": "The halogens are chemical elements under the second-to-right column in the periodic table, also known as Group 17. The elements in the group are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, astatine, and ununseptium.", "full_text": "The halogens or halogen elements  are a group in the periodic table consisting of five chemically related elements: fluorine , chlorine , bromine , iodine , and astatine . The artificially created element 117  may also be a halogen. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, this group is known as group 17.\nThe name 'halogen' means 'salt-producing'. When halogens react with metals they produce a wide range of salts, including calcium fluoride, sodium chloride , silver bromide and potassium iodide.\nThe group of halogens is the only periodic table group that contains elements in three of the four main states of matter at standard temperature and pressure. All of the halogens form acids when bonded to hydrogen. Most halogens are typically produced from minerals or salts. The middle halogens, that is chlorine, bromine and iodine, are often used as disinfectants. Organobromides are the most important class of flame retardants. Elemental halogens are lethally to dangerously toxic.", "title": "Halogen"}
