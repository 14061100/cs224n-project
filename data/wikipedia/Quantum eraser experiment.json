{"summary": "Quantum mechanics  is the part of physics that tells us how the things that make up atoms work.", "full_text": "In quantum mechanics, the quantum eraser experiment is an interferometer experiment that demonstrates several fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics, including quantum entanglement and complementarity.\nThe double-slit quantum eraser experiment described in this article has three stages:\nFirst, the experimenter reproduces the interference pattern of Young's double-slit experiment by shining photons at the double-slit interferometer and checking for an interference pattern at the detection screen.\nNext, the experimenter marks through which slit each photon went, without disturbing its wavefunction, and demonstrates that thereafter the interference pattern is destroyed. This stage indicates that it is the existence of the \"which-path\" information that causes the destruction of the interference pattern.\nThird, the \"which-path\" information is \"erased,\" whereupon the interference pattern is recovered. \nA key result is that it does not matter whether the eraser procedure is done before or after the detection of the photons.\nQuantum erasure technology can be used to increase the resolution of advanced microscopes.", "title": "Quantum eraser experiment"}
