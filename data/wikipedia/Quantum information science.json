{"summary": "Quantum mechanics  is the part of physics that tells us how the things that make up atoms work.", "full_text": "Quantum information science is an area of study based on the idea that information science depends on quantum effects in physics. It includes theoretical issues in computational models as well as more experimental topics in quantum physics including what can and cannot be done with quantum information. The term quantum information theory is sometimes used, but it fails to encompass experimental research in the area.\nSubfields include:\nQuantum computing, which deals on the one hand with the question how and whether one can build a quantum computer and on the other hand, algorithms that harness its power \nQuantum complexity theory\nQuantum cryptography and its generalization, quantum communication\nQuantum error correction\nQuantum communication complexity\nQuantum entanglement, as seen from an information-theoretic point of view\nQuantum dense coding\nQuantum teleportation is a well-known quantum information processing operation, which can be used to move any arbitrary quantum state from one particle  to another.", "title": "Quantum information science"}
