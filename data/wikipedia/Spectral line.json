{"summary": "Spectral lines are how scientists tell one element from another by looking at color.", "full_text": "A spectral line is a dark or bright line in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum, resulting from emission or absorption of light in a narrow frequency range, compared with the nearby frequencies. Spectral lines are often used to identify atoms and molecules from their characteristic spectral lines. These \"fingerprints\" can be compared to the previously collected fingerprints of atoms and molecules, and are thus used to identify the atomic and molecular components of stars and planets which would otherwise be impossible.", "title": "Spectral line"}
