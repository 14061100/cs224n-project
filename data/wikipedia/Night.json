{"summary": "Night or nighttime is the time when the Sun is not in the sky.", "full_text": "Night or nighttime  is the period of time between the sunset and the sunrise when the Sun is below the horizon.\nThis occurs after dusk. The opposite of night is day . The start and end points of time of a night vary based on factors such as season, latitude, longitude and timezone.\nAt any given time, one side of the planet Earth is bathed in light from the Sun  and the other side of the Earth is in the shadow caused by the Earth blocking the light of the sun. This shadow is called the umbra. Natural illumination is still provided by a combination of moonlight, planetary light, starlight, diffuse zodiacal light, gegenschein, and airglow. In some circumstances, bioluminescence, aurorae, and lightning can provide some illumination. The glow provided by artificial illumination is sometimes referred to as light pollution because it can interfere with observational astronomy and ecosystems.", "title": "Night"}
