{"summary": "Jasper County is a county in the U.S.", "full_text": "William Jasper  was a noted American soldier in the Revolutionary War. He was a sergeant in the 2nd South Carolina Regiment.\nJasper distinguished himself in the defense of Fort Moultrie  on June 28, 1776. When a shell from a British warship shot away the flagstaff, he recovered the South Carolina flag in the Battle of Sullivan's Island, raised it on a temporary staff, and held it under fire until a new staff was installed . Governor John Rutledge gave his sword to Jasper in recognition of his bravery.\nIn 1779, Sergeant Jasper participated in the Siege of Savannah, led by General Lincoln, which failed to recapture Savannah, Georgia, from the British. He was mortally wounded during an assault on the British forces there.\nSgt. Jasper's story is similar to that of Sgt. John Newton. Several states have adjacent counties named Jasper and Newton, as these were remembered as a pair, due to the popularity of Parson Weems' fictionalizing early American history. Several other states have a Jasper County with a county seat of Newton, or vice versa.", "title": "William Jasper"}
