{"summary": "Marianne Faithfull  is an English singer and actress who has had many hit songs, solo and with other singers.", "full_text": "Marianne Evelyn Faithfull  is an English singer, songwriter and actress, whose career has spanned six decades.\nHer early work in pop and rock music in the 1960s was overshadowed by her struggle with drug abuse in the 1970s. During the first two-thirds of that decade, she produced only two little-noticed studio albums. After a long commercial absence, she returned late in 1979 with the highly acclaimed album Broken English. Faithfull's subsequent solo work, often critically acclaimed, has at times been overshadowed by her personal history.\nFrom 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with the Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger. She co-wrote \"Sister Morphine\", which is featured on the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers album, and had an early hit with the Jagger/Richards composition \"As Tears Go By.\"", "title": "Marianne Faithfull"}
