{"summary": "Voltage is a force that makes electricity move through a wire.", "full_text": "Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension  is the difference in electric potential energy between two points per unit electric charge. The voltage between two points is equal to the work done per unit of charge against a static electric field to move the charge between two points and is measured in units of volts .\nVoltage can be caused by static electric fields, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three. A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage  between two points in a system; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points. A voltage may represent either a source of energy , or lost, used, or stored energy .", "title": "Voltage"}
