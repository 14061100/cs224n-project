Born in Asheville, North Carolina, he was raised in suburban Maryland, a few minutes from D.C. after his family relocated there. An exceptionally bright child, with parents able to afford a series of costly prep schools, upon graduation, MacKenzie attended Yale University on a scholarship, but returned to Maryland upon receiving his Bachelor's degree. Once back in Maryland, he formed his own alternative rock band, including some young but talented musicians including tenor saxophonist, Ron Holloway, and an ensemble titled Crying Out Loud. Mackenzie's act was from that time billed as Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band, and found a dedicated fan base, although it remained confined to the Washington, D.C. area.\nMacKenzie died in his sleep in his home in Orlando, Florida at the age of 48, and is buried in Fletcher, North Carolina. He was inducted into the Washington Area Music Association Hall of Fame in 2004.", "title": "Root Boy Slim"}
