She rose to prominence after releasing her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990. It went multiplatinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart; \"Vision of Love\", \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\". Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive and later husband Tommy Mottola, Carey continued booking success with follow-up albums Emotions , Music Box , and Merry Christmas , and was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream  made music history when its second single \"One Sweet Day\", a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and it remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history. During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her slower R&B and ballad-oriented beginnings and slowly transitioned into hip hop. This musical change became further established with the release of Butterfly , which was released during the midst of her separation from Mottola.\nCarey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records America. Before the release of her film Glitter , she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film and album's negative reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multimillion dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi . Its second single \"We Belong Together\" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named \"Song of the Decade\" by Billboard. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in Precious , and was awarded the \"Breakthrough Performance Award\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards. Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. With the release of \"Touch My Body\" , Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards, and 14 Billboard Music Awards. Referred to as the \"songbird supreme\" by the Guinness World Records, she is famed for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style and signature use of the whistle register.", "title": "Mariah Carey"}
