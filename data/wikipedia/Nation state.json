A state is a political and geopolitical entity, while a nation is a cultural and ethnic one. The term \"nation state\" implies that the two coincide, but \"nation state\" formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world.\nThe concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state, city state, empire, confederation, and other state formations with which it may overlap. The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the \"nation state.\"\n\n", "title": "Nation state"}
