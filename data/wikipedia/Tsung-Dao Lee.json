He holds the rank of University Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1953 and from which he retired in 2012.\nIn 1957, Lee, at the age of 30, won the Nobel Prize in Physics with C. N. Yang for their work on the violation of the parity law in weak interactions, which Chien-Shiung Wu experimentally verified.\nLee was the youngest Nobel laureate after World War II until Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. He is the fourth youngest Nobel laureate in history after W. L. Bragg , Werner Heisenberg  and Malala Yousafzai. Lee and Yang were the first Chinese laureates.
