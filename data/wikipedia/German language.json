{"summary": "The German language  is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family.", "full_text": "German  is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. A proportion of German words are derived from Latin and Greek, and fewer are borrowed from French and English. Languages which are most similar to German include Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, the continental Scandinavian languages and Luxembourgish. A Germanophone is a speaker of the German language either natively or by preference.\nGerman is the most widely spoken  language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Italian province of South Tyrol  and Liechtenstein; it is also an official  language of Belgium and Luxembourg. With slightly different standardized variants , German is a pluricentric language. German is also notable for its broad spectrum of dialects, with many unique varieties existing in Europe and also other parts of the world. Due to the limited intelligibility between certain varieties and Standard German, as well as the lack of an undisputed, scientific difference between a \"dialect\" and a \"language\", some German varieties or dialect groups  are alternatively referred to as \"languages\" and \"dialects\".\nOne of the major languages of the world, German is the first language of about 95 million people worldwide and the most widely spoken native language in the European Union. German also is the third most widely taught foreign language in both the US and the EU, the second most commonly used scientific language, the third largest contributor to research and development as well as the third most widely used language on websites. Germany is ranked fifth in terms of annual publication of new books, with one tenth of all books  in the world being published in the German language.", "title": "German language"}
