{"summary": "1979  was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "The Vela Incident, also known as the South Atlantic Flash, was an unidentified \"double flash\" of light detected by an American Vela Hotel satellite on September 22, 1979, near the Prince Edward Islands off Antarctica, which many believe was of nuclear origin. The most widespread theory among those who believe the flash was of nuclear origin is that it resulted from a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test. The topic remains highly disputed.\nWhile a \"double flash\" signal is characteristic of a nuclear weapons test, the signal could also have been a spurious electronic signal generated by an aging detector in an old satellite, or a meteoroid hitting the Vela satellite. No corroboration of an explosion, such as the presence of nuclear byproducts in the air, was ever publicly acknowledged, even though there were numerous passes in the area by U.S. Air Force planes specifically designed to detect airborne radioactive dust. Other examiners of the data, including the Defense Intelligence Agency , the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory , and defense contractors, have come to the conclusion that the flash was not a result of a nuclear detonation. Much information about the event remains classified.\n\n", "title": "South Atlantic Flash"}
