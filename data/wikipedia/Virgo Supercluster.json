At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs . It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable universe.\nA 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of a greater supercluster, Laniakea, which is centered on the Great Attractor.", "title": "Virgo Supercluster"}
