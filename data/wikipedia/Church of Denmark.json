{"summary": "Denmark , officially named the Kingdom of Denmark, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe.", "full_text": "The Church of Denmark or Danish National Church , formally known in English as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, is the state church and largest denomination in Denmark and Greenland. Since the Reformation in Denmark, the Church has been Evangelical Lutheran, while retaining much of its pre-Reformation liturgical traditions. As of 1 January 2015, 77.8% of the population of Denmark are members of the Church of Denmark.\nThe 1849 Constitution of Denmark designated the church \"the Danish people's church\". The church is financially supported by the state, but membership is voluntary. The reigning monarch is the supreme authority, but not the head, of the Church, with the Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs, currently Bertel Haarder, as the highest administrative authority of the Church.\nUnlike many Protestant churches, the Church of Denmark continues to maintain the historical episcopate. Theological authority is vested in bishops: ten bishops in mainland Denmark, each overseeing a cathedral, and one from Greenland. There is no archbishop; the Bishop of Copenhagen acts as a primus inter pares.", "title": "Church of Denmark"}
