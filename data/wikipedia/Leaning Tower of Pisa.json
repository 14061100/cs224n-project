{"summary": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a building in Pisa, Italy.", "full_text": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa  or simply the Tower of Pisa  is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt.\nIt is situated behind the Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square  after the Cathedral and the Baptistery. The tower's tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed, and gradually increased until the structure was stabilized  by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.\nThe height of the tower is 55.86 metres  from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres  on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m . Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons . The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. Prior to restoration work performed between 1990 and 2001, the tower leaned at an angle of 5.5 degrees, but the tower now leans at about 3.99 degrees. This means that the top of the tower is displaced horizontally 3.9 metres  from the centre.", "title": "Leaning Tower of Pisa"}
