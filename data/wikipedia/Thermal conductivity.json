{"summary": "Thermal conductivity is the ability of a material to conduct heat.", "full_text": "In physics, thermal conductivity  is the property of a material to conduct heat. It is evaluated primarily in terms of Fourier's Law for heat conduction.\nHeat transfer occurs at a lower rate across materials of low thermal conductivity than across materials of high thermal conductivity. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink applications and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The thermal conductivity of a material may depend on temperature. The reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity.\nThermal conductivity is actually a tensor, which means it is possible to have different values in different directions.
