{"summary": "Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists.", "full_text": "Theism, in the field of comparative religion, is the belief that at least one deity exists. In popular parlance, the term theism often describes the classical conception of God that is found in the monotheistic and polytheistic religions.\nThe term theism derives from the Greek theos meaning \"god\". The term theism was first used by Ralph Cudworth . In Cudworth's definition, they are \"strictly and properly called Theists, who affirm, that a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, was the cause of all other things\".\nAtheism is rejection of theism in the broadest sense of theism; i.e. the absence of belief that there is even one deity. Rejection of the narrower sense of theism can take forms such as deism, pantheism, and polytheism. The claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable is agnosticism. The positive assertion of knowledge, either of the existence of gods or the absence of gods, can also be attributed to some theists and some atheists. Put simply, theism and atheism deal with belief, and agnosticism deals with rational claims to asserting knowledge.", "title": "Theism"}
