{"summary": "Leonard \"Chico\" Marx  was an American comedian and movie star.", "full_text": "Leonard \"Chico\" Marx  was an American comedian, musician, bandleader, actor and film star as part of the Marx Brothers. His persona in the act was that of a charming, dim-witted albeit crafty con artist, seemingly of rural Italian origin, who wore shabby clothes, and sported a curly-haired wig and Tyrolean hat. In virtually every film that includes the main trio of the Marx Brothers, Chico is seen working with Harpo Marx, usually as partners in crime.\nLeonard was the oldest of the Marx Brothers to live past early childhood . In addition to his work as a performer, he played an important role in the management and development of the act, at least in its early years.", "title": "Chico Marx"}
