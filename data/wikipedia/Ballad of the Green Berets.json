{"summary": "1966  was a common year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "\"The Ballad of the Green Berets\" is a patriotic song in the ballad style about the Green Berets, an elite special force in the U.S. Army. It is one of the very few songs of the 1960s to cast the military in a positive light and in 1966 it became a major hit, reaching No. 1 for five weeks on the Hot 100 and four weeks on Cashbox. It was also a crossover smash, reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on Billboard's Country survey.\nThe song was written by Robin Moore and Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler, while the latter was recuperating from a leg wound suffered as a medic in the Vietnam War. Moore also wrote a book, The Green Berets, about the force. The tune itself is borrowed from the traditional American folk song \"The Butcher Boy\".\nLyrics include:\n\n\"Back at home a young wife waits\nHer Green Beret has met his fate He has died for those oppressed Leaving her this last request\nPut silver wings on my son's chest Make him one of America's best He'll be a man they'll test one day Have him win the Green Beret\"\n\nThe lyrics were written in honor of Green Beret James Gabriel, Jr., the first native Hawaiian who died in Vietnam, who was executed by the Viet Cong while on a training mission on April 8, 1962. One verse was written in honor of Gabriel, but it never made it into the final version.\nSadler debuted the song on television on January 30, 1966 on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\n", "title": "Ballad of the Green Berets"}
