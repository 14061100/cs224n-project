{"summary": "The Green Party is considered a political party in the United States.", "full_text": "The Green Party of the United States  is a green, left-wing political party in the United States.\nThe party, which is the country's fourth-largest by membership, promotes environmentalism, nonviolence, social justice, participatory grassroots democracy, feminism, LGBT rights, and anti-racism.\nThe GPUS was founded in 2001 as the evolution of the Association of State Green Parties , which was formed in 1996. After its founding, the GPUS soon became the primary national green organization in the country, eclipsing the Greens/Green Party USA , which formed in 1991 out of the Green Committees of Correspondence , a collection of local green groups active since 1984. The ASGP had increasingly distanced itself from the G/GPUSA in the late 1990s.\nThe Greens gained widespread public attention during the 2000 presidential election, when the ticket composed of Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke, won 2.7% of the popular vote. Nader was vilified by some Democrats, who accused him of spoiling the election for Al Gore, the Democratic candidate. Nader's impact on the 2000 election remains controversial.\nThe GPUS had several members elected in state legislatures, including in California, Maine and Arkansas. A number of Greens around the United States hold positions on the municipal level, including on school boards, city councils and as mayors.", "title": "Green Party (United States)"}
