{"summary": "Baryons are composite particles which are made of three quarks.", "full_text": "A baryon is a composite subatomic particle made up of three quarks . Baryons and mesons belong to the hadron family of particles, which are the quark-based particles. The name \"baryon\" comes from the Greek word for \"heavy\" , because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons.\nAs quark-based particles, baryons participate in the strong interaction, whereas leptons, which are not quark-based, do not. The most familiar baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe. Electrons  are leptons.\nEach baryon has a corresponding antiparticle  where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.", "title": "Baryon"}
