The Wild Angels was made three years before Easy Rider and was the first film to associate actor Peter Fonda with Harley-Davidson motorcycles and 1960s counterculture. It was also the film that inspired the outlaw biker film genre that continued into the early 1970s.\nThe Wild Angels, released by American International Pictures , stars Fonda as the fictitious Hells Angels San Pedro, California chapter president \"Heavenly Blues\" , Nancy Sinatra as his girlfriend \"Mike\", Bruce Dern as doomed fellow outlaw \"the Loser\", and Dern's real-life wife Diane Ladd as the Loser's on-screen wife, \"Gaysh\".\nSmall supporting roles are played by Michael J. Pollard and Gayle Hunnicutt and, according to literature promoting the film, members of the Hells Angels from Venice, California. Members of the Coffin Cheaters motorcycle club also appeared.\nIn 1967 AIP followed this film with Devil's Angels, The Glory Stompers with Dennis Hopper, and The Born Losers.\n^ Samuel Z Arkoff & Richard Turbo, Flying Through Hollywood By the Seat of My Pants, Birch Lane Press, 1992 p 163\n^ \"The Wild Angels, Box Office Information\".
