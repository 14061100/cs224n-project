{"summary": "Electrochemistry is a kind of chemistry that studies chemical reactions that use or make electricity: Reactions like this happen at electrodes which are made from something that conducts electricity, and put in an electrolyte.", "full_text": "Electrochemistry is the branch of physical chemistry that studies chemical reactions which take place at the interface of an electrode, usually a solid metal or a semiconductor, and an ionic conductor, the electrolyte. These reactions involve electric charges moving between the electrodes and the electrolyte . Thus electrochemistry deals with the interaction between electrical energy and chemical change.\nWhen a chemical reaction is caused by an externally supplied current, as in electrolysis, or if an electric current is produced by a spontaneous chemical reaction as in a battery, it is called an electrochemical reaction. Chemical reactions where electrons are transferred directly between molecules and/or atoms are called oxidation-reduction or  reactions. In general, electrochemistry describes the overall reactions when individual redox reactions are separate but connected by an external electric circuit and an intervening electrolyte.", "title": "Electrochemistry"}
