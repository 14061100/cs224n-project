{"summary": "Hydrochloric acid is a chemical compound.", "full_text": "Hydrochloric acid is a clear, colorless, highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride  in water. It is a highly corrosive, strong mineral acid with many industrial uses. Hydrochloric acid is found naturally in gastric acid.\nIt was historically called acidum salis, muriatic acid, and spirits of salt because it was produced from rock salt and green vitriol  and later from the chemically similar substances common salt and sulfuric acid . Free hydrochloric acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius. Later, it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley, and Davy in their scientific research.\nWith major production starting in the Industrial Revolution, hydrochloric acid is used in the chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI/TDI for polyurethane. It has numerous smaller-scale applications, including household cleaning, production of gelatin and other food additives, descaling, and leather processing. About 20 million tonnes of hydrochloric acid are produced worldwide annually.", "title": "Hydrochloric acid"}
