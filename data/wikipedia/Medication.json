{"summary": "Medication  is the use of licenced drugs to treat or cure an illness.", "full_text": "A pharmaceutical drug  is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. Drug therapy  is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.\nDrugs are classified in various ways. One of the key divisions is by level of control, which distinguishes prescription drugs  from over-the-counter drugs . Another key distinction is between traditional small molecule drugs, usually derived from chemical synthesis, and biopharmaceuticals, which include recombinant proteins, vaccines, blood products used therapeutically , gene therapy, and cell therapy . Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, route of administration, biological system affected, or therapeutic effects. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System . The World Health Organization keeps a list of essential medicines.\nDrug discovery and drug development are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists, and governments. Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, how drugs are marketed, and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing. Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.", "title": "Medication"}
