{"summary": "A Compact Disc  is a type of optical disc.", "full_text": "Compact disc  is a digital optical disc data storage format. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data . Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage , rewritable media , Video Compact Disc , Super Video Compact Disc , Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CDs and audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982.\nStandard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres  and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700 MiB of data. The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres ; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering device drivers.\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD had greater storage capacity than a personal computer hard drive. By 2010 hard drives commonly had capacities exceeding those of CDs by a factor of several thousand.\nIn 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide. CDs are increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that audio CD sales rates in the U.S. have dropped about 50% from their peak; however, they remain one of the primary distribution methods for the music industry.", "title": "Compact disc"}
