{"summary": "Jessica Watson  is an Australian teenager who became the youngest person to sail around the world alone.", "full_text": "Jessica Watson, OAM  is an Australian sailor who completed a southern hemisphere solo circumnavigation at the age of 16.\nDeparting Sydney on 18 October 2009, Watson headed north-east crossing the equator in the Pacific Ocean before crossing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. She returned to Sydney on 15 May 2010, three days before her 17th birthday. The voyage was shorter than the required 21,600 nautical miles to be considered a global circumnavigation, and Watson never claimed the voyage to be an attempt at such, preferring the less formal term 'around the world'. In recognition of her achievement Watson was named the 2011 Young Australian of the Year, and the following year was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. She currently resides in Buderim, Queensland.\n^ \"The facts about Jessica's Voyage\". 5 May 2010. Retrieved 28 Feb 2015. \n^ \"Jessica Watson completes historic round-the-world voyage\".
