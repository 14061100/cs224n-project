Often characterised as \"eccentric\", he wished to climb Everest as a platform to promote his belief that the world's ills could be solved by a combination of fasting and faith in God. Despite his lack of mountaineering or flying experience, he succeeded in flying from Britain to India, surreptitiously entering Tibet and climbing as high as 6,920 metres  on Mount Everest. However, he died in his attempt, and his body was found the following year by a British expedition.", "title": "Maurice Wilson"}
