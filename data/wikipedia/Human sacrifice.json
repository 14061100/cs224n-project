Human sacrifice has been practiced in various cultures throughout history. Victims were typically ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods, spirits or the deceased, for example as a propitiatory offering, or as a retainer sacrifice when the King's servants are killed in order for them to continue to serve their master in the next life. Closely related practices found in some tribal societies are cannibalism and headhunting. By the Iron Age, with the associated developments in religion , human sacrifice was becoming less common throughout the Old World, and came to be looked down upon as barbaric in pre-modern times . In the New World, however, human sacrifice continued to be widespread to varying degrees until the European colonization of the Americas.\nIn modern times, even the practice of animal sacrifice has virtually disappeared from all major religions , and human sacrifice has become extremely rare. Most religions condemn the practice, and present-day secular laws treat it as murder. In a society which condemns human sacrifice, the term ritual murder is used.", "title": "Human sacrifice"}
