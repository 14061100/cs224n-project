Both are elected in full once every four years, with the last election being held in 2011.\nThe Federal Assembly possesses the federal government's legislative power, along with the separate constitutional right of citizen's initiative. For a law to pass, it must be passed by both houses. The Federal Assembly may come together as a United Federal Assembly in certain circumstances, including to elect the Federal Council, the Federal Chancellor, a General , or federal judges.\n\n", "title": "Federal Assembly of Switzerland"}
