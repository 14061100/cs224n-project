{"summary": "Lorentz's law is a law discovered by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.", "full_text": "In physics, particularly electromagnetism, the Lorentz force is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. If a particle of charge q moves with velocity v in the presence of an electric field E and a magnetic field B, then it will experience a force\n\n. Variations on this basic formula describe the magnetic force on a current-carrying wire , the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through a magnetic field , and the force on a charged particle which might be travelling near the speed of light .\nThe first derivation of the Lorentz force is commonly attributed to Oliver Heaviside in 1889, although other historians suggest an earlier origin in an 1865 paper by James Clerk Maxwell. Hendrik Lorentz derived it a few years after Heaviside.\n^ \n^", "title": "Lorentz force"}
