{"summary": "Newport is a city in the southeast of Wales, Great Britain.", "full_text": "Monmouthshire , also known as the County of Monmouth , is one of thirteen historic counties of Wales and a former administrative county.\nIt corresponds approximately to the present principal areas of Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Newport and Torfaen, and those parts of Caerphilly and Cardiff east of the Rhymney River.\nThe eastern part of the county is mainly agricultural, while the western valleys had rich mineral resources. This led to the area becoming highly industrialised with coal mining and iron working being major employers from the 18th century to the late 20th century.\nMonmouthshire's Welsh status was ambiguous between the 16th and 20th centuries, with it considered by some to be part of England during this time.", "title": "Monmouthshire (historic)"}
