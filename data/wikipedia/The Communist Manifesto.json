{"summary": "The Manifesto of the Communist Party , more commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, is a short book.", "full_text": "The Communist Manifesto  is an 1848 political pamphlet by German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Commissioned by the Communist League and originally published in London  just as the revolutions of 1848 began to erupt, the Manifesto was later recognised as one of the world's most influential political manuscripts. It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle  and the problems of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.\nThe Communist Manifesto summarises Marx and Engels' theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism, and then finally communism.", "title": "The Communist Manifesto"}
