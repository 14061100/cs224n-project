{"summary": "Fujian  is a province on the southeast coast of China.", "full_text": "Fujian , formerly romanised as Foken, Fouken, or Hokkien, is a province on the southeast coast of mainland China. Fujian is bordered by Zhejiang to the north, Jiangxi to the west, and Guangdong to the south. The name Fujian came from the combination of Fuzhou and Jianzhou  two cities in Fujian, during the Tang dynasty. While its population is chiefly of Han origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China.\nMost of Fujian is administered by the People's Republic of China. However, the archipelagos of Kinmen and Matsu are under the control of the Republic of China. Thus, there are two provinces : the Fujian Province administered by the People's Republic of China and the Fujian Province of the Republic of China.", "title": "Fujian"}
