{"summary": "Cecil John Rhodes  was an English-born South African businessman and politician.", "full_text": "Cecil John Rhodes PC  was a British imperialist, businessman, mining magnate, and politician in South Africa. An ardent believer in British colonialism, Rhodes was the founder of the southern African territory of Rhodesia, which was named after him in 1895. South Africa's Rhodes University is also named after Rhodes. He set up the provisions of the Rhodes Scholarship, which is funded by his estate.\nHistorian Richard A. McFarlane has called Rhodes \"as integral a participant in southern African and British imperial history as George Washington or Abraham Lincoln are in their respective eras in United States history. Most histories of South Africa covering the last decades of the nineteenth century are contributions to the historiography of Cecil Rhodes.\" According to McFarlane, the aforementioned historiography \"may be divided into two broad categories: chauvinistic approval or utter vilification\". Paul Maylam identifies three perspectives: works that attempt to either venerate or debunk Rhodes, and \"the intermediate view, according to which Rhodes is not straightforwardly assessed as either hero or villain\".", "title": "Cecil Rhodes"}
