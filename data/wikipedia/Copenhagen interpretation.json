{"summary": "The Copenhagen interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics.", "full_text": "The Copenhagen interpretation is an expression of the meaning of quantum mechanics that was largely devised in the years 1925 to 1927 by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. It remains one of the most commonly taught interpretations of quantum mechanics.\nAccording to the Copenhagen interpretation, physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probabilities that measurements will produce certain results. The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement. This feature is known as wavefunction collapse.\nThere have been many objections to the Copenhagen Interpretation over the years. Some have objected to the discontinuous jumps when there is an observation, or the probabilistic element introduced upon observation; or to the subjectiveness of requiring an observer; or to the difficulty of defining a measuring device; or to the necessity of invoking classical physics to describe the \"laboratory\" in which the results are measured.\nAlternatives to the Copenhagen Interpretation include the many-worlds interpretation, the De Broglie-Bohm  interpretation, and quantum decoherence theories.", "title": "Copenhagen interpretation"}
