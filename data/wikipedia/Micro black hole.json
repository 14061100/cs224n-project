{"summary": "Hawking radiation is black body radiation which is emitted by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon.", "full_text": "Micro black holes, also called quantum mechanical black holes or mini black holes, are hypothetical tiny black holes, for which quantum mechanics effects play an important role.\nIt is possible that such quantum primordial black holes were created in the high-density environment of the early Universe , or possibly through subsequent phase transitions. They might be observed by astrophysicists in the near future, through the particles they are expected to emit by Hawking radiation.\nSome hypotheses involving additional space dimensions predict that micro black holes could be formed at energies as low as the TeV range, which are available in particle accelerators such as the LHC . Popular concerns have then been raised over end-of-the-world scenarios . However, such quantum black holes would instantly evaporate, either totally or leaving only a very weakly interacting residue. Beside the theoretical arguments, the cosmic rays bombarding the Earth do not produce any damage, although they reach center of mass energies in the range of hundreds of TeV.", "title": "Micro black hole"}
