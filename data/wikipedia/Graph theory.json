{"summary": "Graph theory is a field of mathematics about graphs.", "full_text": "In mathematics and computer science, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices or nodes or points and edges or arcs or lines that connect them. A graph may be undirected, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another; see Graph  for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.\nRefer to the glossary of graph theory for basic definitions in graph theory.\n\n", "title": "Graph theory"}
