{"summary": "A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle in particle physics that is a magnet with only one magnetic pole .", "full_text": "A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle in particle physics that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole . In more technical terms, a magnetic monopole would have a net \"magnetic charge\". Modern interest in the concept stems from particle theories, notably the grand unified and superstring theories, which predict their existence.\nMagnetism in bar magnets and electromagnets does not arise from magnetic monopoles. There is no conclusive experimental evidence that magnetic monopoles exist at all in our universe.\nSome condensed matter systems contain effective  magnetic monopole quasi-particles, or contain phenomena that are mathematically analogous to magnetic monopoles.", "title": "Magnetic monopole"}
