{"summary": "A Bachelor's degree is the certificate given to a university student after he has succeeded in an end of course examination.", "full_text": "A bachelor's degree  or baccalaureate  is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years . In some cases, it may also be the name of a second graduate degree, such as the Bachelor of Laws , Bachelor of Education , Bachelor of Civil Law , Bachelor of Music , Bachelor of Philosophy , or Bachelor of Sacred Theology  degrees, which in some countries are only offered after a first graduate/bachelor's degree.\nThe term \"bachelor\" in the 12th century referred to a knight bachelor, too young or poor to gather vassals under his own banner. By the end of the 13th century, it was also used by junior members of guilds or universities. By folk etymology or wordplay, the word baccalaureus came to be associated with bacca lauri  in reference to laurels being awarded for academic success or honours.\nUnder the British system, and those influenced by it, undergraduate academic degrees are differentiated either as pass degrees  or as honours degrees, the latter sometimes denoted by the appearance of \"\" after the degree abbreviation. An honours degree generally requires a higher academic standard than a pass degree, and in some universities a fourth year of study. In some countries, e.g., Australia and Canada, the honours degree should not be confused with the \"postgraduate\" bachelor's degree \"with honours\" or the baccalaureatus cum honore degree. It is a consecutive academic degree, which is the continuation of a completed  bachelor's degree program in the same field and is usually obtained in order to join a doctoral programme; it requires a minimum of one year, but may also take longer.", "title": "Bachelor's degree"}
