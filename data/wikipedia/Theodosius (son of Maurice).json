{"summary": "This is a list of the Emperors of the late Eastern Roman Empire, called Byzantine by modern historians.", "full_text": "Theodosius  was the eldest son of Byzantine Emperor Maurice  and was co-emperor from 590 until his deposition and execution during a military revolt in November 602. Along with his father-in-law Germanus, he was briefly proposed as successor to Maurice by the troops, but the army eventually favoured Phocas instead. Sent in an abortive mission to secure aid from Sassanid Persia by his father, Theodosius was captured and executed by Phocas's supporters a few days after Maurice. Nevertheless, rumours spread that he had survived the execution, and became popular to the extent that a man who purported to be Theodosius was entertained by the Persians as a pretext for launching a war against Byzantium.\n^ Kazhdan 1991, p. 2050.\n^ Martindale, Jones & Morris 1992, p. 1293.", "title": "Theodosius (son of Maurice)"}
