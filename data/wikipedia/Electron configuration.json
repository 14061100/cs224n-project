{"summary": "An electron configuration is the arrangement of electrons within an atom.", "full_text": "In atomic physics and quantum chemistry, the electron configuration is the distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule  in atomic or molecular orbitals. For example, the electron configuration of the neon atom is 1s2 2s2 2p6.\nElectronic configurations describe electrons as each moving independently in an orbital, in an average field created by all other orbitals. Mathematically, configurations are described by Slater determinants or configuration state functions.\nAccording to the laws of quantum mechanics, for systems with only one electron, an energy is associated with each electron configuration and, upon certain conditions, electrons are able to move from one configuration to another by the emission or absorption of a quantum of energy, in the form of a photon.\nKnowledge of the electron configuration of different atoms is useful in understanding the structure of the periodic table of elements. The concept is also useful for describing the chemical bonds that hold atoms together. In bulk materials, this same idea helps explain the peculiar properties of lasers and semiconductors.", "title": "Electron configuration"}
