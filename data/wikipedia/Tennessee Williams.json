{"summary": "Thomas Lanier \"Tennessee\" Williams III  was an American writer, perhaps best known for his play A Streetcar Named Desire.", "full_text": "Thomas Lanier \"Tennessee\" Williams III  was an American playwright and author of many stage classics. Along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller he is considered among the three foremost playwrights in 20th century American drama.\nAfter years of obscurity, he became suddenly famous with The Glass Menagerie , closely reflecting his own unhappy family background. This heralded a string of successes, including A Streetcar Named Desire , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , and Sweet Bird of Youth . His later work attempted a new style that did not appeal to audiences, and alcohol and drug dependence further inhibited his creative output. His drama A Streetcar Named Desire is often numbered on the short list of the finest American plays of the 20th century alongside Long Day's Journey into Night and Death of a Salesman.\nMuch of Williams' most acclaimed work was adapted for the cinema. He also wrote short stories, poetry, essays and a volume of memoirs. In 1979, four years before his death, Williams was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.", "title": "Tennessee Williams"}
