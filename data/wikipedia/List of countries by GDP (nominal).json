{"summary": "This is a list of countries of the world sorted by their gross domestic product .", "full_text": "Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity , to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem, but has its own drawbacks; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than nominal GDP. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\nThe first list includes data compiled by the United Nations Statistics Division for 2013, the second list largely includes data  compiled by the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook for 2014, the third list shows the World Bank's 2014 estimates, and the fourth list includes mostly 2014 estimates from the The World Factbook by the Central Intelligence Agency. Several economies which are not considered to be countries  are included in the lists because they appear in the sources as distinct economies. These economies are italicized and not ranked in the charts, but are listed where applicable.", "title": "List of countries by GDP (nominal)"}
