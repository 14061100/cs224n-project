{"summary": "Willard Sterling Boyle, CC  was a Canadian physicist and co-inventor of the charge-coupled device.", "full_text": "Lower Canada College  of Montreal is an elementary and secondary level private school. The boarding school was founded by the Church of St John the Evangelist in 1861 as St. John's School and changed its name to Lower Canada College in 1909, replacing an older school by that name that was founded in 1847.\nLCC offers education from Kindergarten through Grade 12. Students graduate from Grade 11, and then have the option of leaving the school and going on to a Pre-University college, unique to the Quebec system, or returning to LCC for the Pre-University year.\nThe annual fees for attending LCC range from $17,415 to $20,066.\nUntil recently, LCC was one of the few remaining schools with a covered outdoor ice hockey rink. This has been replaced by a new athletics centre as well as a new arena. In addition to hockey, LCC has been known for fielding strong Lions teams in Canadian football, soccer, basketball and rugby union. LCC's traditional rival in sports and other matters is Selwyn House School.\nOnce boys-only, LCC is now co-educational, with roughly 40 percent of the population being girls. Girls were first admitted to Grade 12 in 1992 and were phased into the other grades beginning in the 1995-96 school year.", "title": "Lower Canada College"}
