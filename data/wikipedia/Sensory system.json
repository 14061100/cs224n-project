{"summary": "The sensory system is the way animals find out about their nearby environment and their bodies.", "full_text": "The sensory nervous system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information. A sensory system consists of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, auditory , somatic sensation , gustatory , olfaction  and vestibular . In short, senses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind where we interpret the information, creating our perception of the world around us.\nThe receptive field is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each rod or cone can see, is its receptive field. Receptive fields have been identified for the visual system, auditory system and somatosensory system, so far.", "title": "Sensory system"}
