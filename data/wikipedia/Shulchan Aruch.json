{"summary": "The Shulchan Aruch  is a compilation of Jewish law, or halakha.", "full_text": "The Shulchan Aruch  also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \"the Code of Jewish Law.\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed, Israel, by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.\nThe halachic rulings in the Shulchan Aruch generally follow Sephardic law and customs whereas Ashkenazi Jews will generally follow the halachic rulings of Moses Isserles whose glosses to the Shulchan Aruch note where the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs differ. These glosses are widely referred to as the mappah  to the Shulchan Aruch's \"Set Table\". Almost all published editions of the Shulchan Aruch include this gloss, and the term \"Shulchan Aruch\" has come to denote both Karo's work as well as Isserlis', with Karo usually referred to as \"the mechaber\"  and Isserles as \"the Rema\".", "title": "Shulchan Aruch"}
