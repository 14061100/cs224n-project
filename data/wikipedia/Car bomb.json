{"summary": "A car bomb is a bomb device that is hidden within a vehicle.", "full_text": "A car bomb, or truck bomb, also known as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device , is an improvised explosive device placed inside a car or other vehicle and detonated.\nIt is commonly used as a weapon of assassination, terrorism or guerrilla warfare, to kill the occupants of the vehicle, people near the blast site, or to damage buildings or other property. Car bombs act as their own delivery mechanisms and can carry a relatively large amount of explosives without attracting suspicion; in larger vehicles and trucks, weights of at least 7,000 pounds  have been used, for example, in the Oklahoma City bombing. Car bombs are activated in a variety of ways; including opening the vehicle's doors, starting the engine, depressing the accelerator or brake pedals or simply lighting a fuse or setting a timing device. The gasoline in the vehicle's fuel tank may make the explosion of the bomb more powerful by dispersing and igniting the fuel.", "title": "Car bomb"}
