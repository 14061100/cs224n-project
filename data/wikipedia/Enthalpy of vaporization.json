{"summary": "The Enthalpy of vaporization, also called the latent heat of vaporization is the change in the enthalpy needed to change an amount of liquid into a gas.", "full_text": "The enthalpy of vaporization,  also known as the  heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation, is the enthalpy change required to transform a given quantity of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure .\nIt is often measured at the normal boiling point of a substance; although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298 K, the correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value.\nThe heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature Tr<<1.0. The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at the critical temperature  because above the critical temperature the liquid and vapor phases no longer exist, since the substance is a supercritical fluid.", "title": "Enthalpy of vaporization"}
