{"summary": "A cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes.", "full_text": "Cathode rays  are streams of electrons observed in vacuum tubes. If an evacuated glass tube is equipped with two electrodes and a voltage is applied, the glass opposite of the negative electrode is observed to glow, due to electrons emitted from and travelling perpendicular to the cathode . They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein Kathodenstrahlen, or cathode rays.\nElectrons were first discovered as the constituents of cathode rays. In 1897 British physicist J. J. Thomson showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later named the electron. Cathode ray tubes  use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set.", "title": "Cathode ray"}
