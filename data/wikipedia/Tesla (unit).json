{"summary": "The tesla  is the SI derived unit used to measure magnetic fields.", "full_text": "The tesla  is a unit of measurement of the strength of the magnetic field. It is a derived unit of the International System of Units, the modern form of the metric system.\nOne tesla is equal to one weber per square metre. The unit was announced during the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and is named in honour of Nikola Tesla.\nThe strongest fields encountered from permanent magnets are from Halbach spheres which can be over 4.5 T. The strongest field trapped in a laboratory superconductor as of July 2014 is 17.6 T. The record magnetic field has been produced by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory campus of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, the world's first 100-tesla, non-destructive magnetic field.", "title": "Tesla (unit)"}
