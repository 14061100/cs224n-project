The school was organized by a committee of Quakers from three \"Hicksite\" yearly meetings: Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia. Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, , Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott, . Swarthmore was established to be a college, \"...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country.\" By 1906 Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.\nSwarthmore is a member of the \"Tri-College Consortium\", a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford Colleges. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.\nSwarthmore students have won 30 Rhodes Scholarships, 8 Marshall Scholarships, 151 Fulbright Scholarships, 22 Truman Scholarships, 13 Luce Scholarships, 67 Watson Fellowships, 3 Soros Fellowships, 18 Goldwater Scholarships, 84 Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowships, 13 National Endowment for the Humanities Grants for Younger Scholars, 234 National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships, 35 Woodrow Wilson Fellowships, and 2 Mitchell Scholarships.", "title": "Swarthmore College"}
