{"summary": "The following is a list of country calling codes.", "full_text": "Regulation of the telephone numbers in Serbia is under the responsibility of the Regulatory Agency of Electronic Communication and Mail Services , independent from the government. The country calling code of Serbia is +381. The country has an open telephone numbering plan, with most numbers consisting of a 2- or 3-digit calling code and a 6-7 digits of customer number.\nThe telephone numbers in Kosovo are not under the purview of RATEL. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but retained the +381 calling code for fixed telephony until 2014. Following the Brussels Agreement, in September 2013, Serbia dropped its opposition to a separate international dialing code for Kosovo, leading to the allocation of the code +383. As of January 1, 2015, Kosovo's official dialing code is +383.\n^ Novi pun naziv RATEL-a  , RATEL, 01.07.2014.  \n^ Seeking EU talks, Serbia cedes ground on Kosovo phone code, Reuters, 9 September, 2013.", "title": "Telephone numbers in Serbia"}
