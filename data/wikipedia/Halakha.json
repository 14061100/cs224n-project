{"summary": "Halakha is the Hebrew word for the Jewish code of laws.", "full_text": "Halakha   is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 mitzvot , subsequent talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the Shulchan Aruch .\nJudaism classically draws no distinction in its laws between religious and non-religious life; Jewish religious tradition does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. Halakha guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but numerous aspects of day-to-day life. Halakha is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the root that means to behave .\nHistorically, in the diaspora, halakha served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law - both civil and religious law, since there is no differentiation in classical Judaism. Since the Age of Enlightenment, emancipation, and haskalah many have come to view the halakha as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on Rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the pure, written words written in the Jewish bible.\nUnder contemporary Israeli law, however, certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts and are therefore treated according to halakha. Some differences in halakha itself are found among Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities,  which are reflective of the historic and geographic diversity of various Jewish communities within the Diaspora.", "title": "Halakha"}
