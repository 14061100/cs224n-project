{"summary": "Abstract algebra is a part of math which studies algebraic structures.", "full_text": "In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra  is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra.\nAlgebraic structures, with their associated homomorphisms, form mathematical categories. Category theory is a powerful formalism for analyzing and comparing different algebraic structures.\nUniversal algebra is a related subject that studies the nature and theories of various types of algebraic structures as a whole. For example, universal algebra studies the overall theory of groups, as distinguished from studying particular groups.", "title": "Abstract algebra"}
