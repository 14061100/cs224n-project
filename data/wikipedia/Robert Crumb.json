{"summary": "Robert Crumb  is a famous American cartoonist and musician.", "full_text": "Robert Dennis Crumb  is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.\nCrumb rose to prominence after the 1968 debut of Zap Comix, the first successful underground comix publication. Popular creations of his from this era include countercultural characters such as Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural, and the images from his \"Keep on Truckin'\" strip. Following the decline of the underground in the mid-1970s, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily crosshatched pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, Weirdo , which was one of the most prominent publications of the alternative comics era.\nIn 1991, Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. He is married to cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, with whom he has frequently collaborated. Their daughter Sophie Crumb has also followed a cartooning career.", "title": "Robert Crumb"}
