{"summary": "If you can count the things in a set, it is called a countable set.", "full_text": "In mathematics, a countable set is a set with the same cardinality  as some subset of the set of natural numbers. A countable set is either a finite set or a countably infinite set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a natural number.\nSome authors use countable set to mean countably infinite alone. To avoid this ambiguity, the term at most countable may be used when finite sets are included and countably infinite, enumerable, or denumerable otherwise.\nGeorg Cantor introduced the term countable set, contrasting sets that are countable with those that are uncountable . Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called discrete mathematics.", "title": "Countable set"}
