{"summary": "Photochemistry is the study of chemical reactions that go with light.", "full_text": "Photochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the chemical effects of light. Generally, this term is used to describe a chemical reaction caused by absorption of ultraviolet , visible light  or infrared radiation .\nPhotochemical reactions are valuable in organic and inorganic chemistry because they proceed differently than thermal reactions. Many thermal reactions have their photochemical counterpart. Photochemical paths offer the advantage over thermal methods of forming thermodynamically disfavored products, overcoming large activation barriers in a short period of time, and allowing reactivity otherwise inaccessible by thermal processes.\nEveryday examples include photosynthesis, degradation of plastics or formation of vitamin D with sunlight.\n\n", "title": "Photochemistry"}
