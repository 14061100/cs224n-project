{"summary": "The word \"information\" is used in many different ways.", "full_text": "The Information is the seventh official studio album and tenth overall by American alternative rock musician Beck, released in October 3, 2006 on Interscope Records. It was produced and mixed by the established producer Nigel Godrich, a long-time Beck collaborator. Recording began in 2003 alongside Guero, but the album was not completed until 2006, three years after recording started. The album's music and lyrics hearken back to the collage of loose-limbed, quirky white-boy funk-rock, rap, and sampling techniques that brought Beck fame. Upon its release, Beck finally got to do things his way, stating \"I've been trying to do something like this for the last three albums.\" Rolling Stone magazine named it the 24th best album of 2006, while Spin magazine ranked it number 10 on their 40 Best Albums of 2006.", "title": "The Information"}
