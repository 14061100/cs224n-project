{"summary": "The Chandra X-ray Observatory   is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999.", "full_text": "The Chandra X-ray Observatory , previously known as the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility , is a space observatory launched on STS-93 by NASA on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, they are not detectable from Earth-based telescopes; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2015.\nChandra is one of the Great Observatories, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.", "title": "Chandra X-ray Observatory"}
