{"summary": "Classical physics is physics that was worked out before our more modern and complete theories.", "full_text": "Classical physics refers to theories of physics that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be \"modern,\" and its introduction represented a major paradigm shift, then the previous theories, or new theories based on the older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the realm of \"classical\" physics.\nAs such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily complex for a particular situation.", "title": "Classical physics"}
