{"summary": "Biffy Clyro, often called Biffy by fans, are a Scottish rock band.", "full_text": "Biffy Clyro are a Scottish rock band that formed in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, composed of Simon Neil , James Johnston  and Ben Johnston . Currently signed to 14th Floor Records, they have released six studio albums, three of which  reached the top five in the UK Albums Chart, with their sixth studio album Opposites claiming their first UK number one album.\nAfter their first three albums, the band expanded their following significantly in 2007 with the release of their fourth, Puzzle, creating more mainstream songs with simpler rhythms and distancing themselves from the more unusual dissonant style that was present in their previous three albums. Puzzle peaked at number 2 on the official UK album charts on 16 June 2007. The album went Gold in the UK, selling over 100,000 units, and later in 2012 went Platinum in the UK, having sold over 300,000 copies.\nTheir 2009 album, Only Revolutions, reached No. 3 in the UK chart and went gold within days of its release in 2009, going platinum later in 2010 and receiving a Mercury Music Prize nomination. Only Revolutions included the UK hit singles, \"Mountains\", \"That Golden Rule\" and \"Many of Horror\" all of which reached the UK Top Ten. The latter reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart after The X Factor 2010 winner Matt Cardle covered the song, and became the UK number one Christmas single for the year of 2010.\nIn 2011 the band was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. At the 2013 NME Awards they received the award for Best British Band. On 25 August 2013 Biffy Clyro headlined the main stage at Leeds & Reading Festival.
