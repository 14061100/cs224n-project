The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity , and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\nThe musical's original 1962 Broadway run won several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Author . A Funny Thing has enjoyed several Broadway and West End revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the musical, Zero Mostel.\n\n", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"}
