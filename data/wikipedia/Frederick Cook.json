{"summary": "Robert Edwin Peary, Sr.", "full_text": "Frederick Albert Cook  was an American explorer, physician, and ethnographer, noted for his claim of having reached the North Pole on April 21, 1908. This was a year before April 6, 1909, the date claimed by the American explorer Robert Peary, and the accounts were disputed for several years. His expedition did discover Meighen Island, the only discovery of an island in the American Arctic by a United States expedition.\nAfter reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the University of Copenhagen ruled in December 1909 that he had not proven that he reached the pole. In 1911 Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing to assert their success. His 1906 account of having reached the summit of Denali has also been discredited.\nThe first undisputed expedition to the North Pole on foot was in 1969 led by British explorer Wally Herbert .", "title": "Frederick Cook"}
