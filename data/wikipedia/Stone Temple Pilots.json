{"summary": "Stone Temple Pilots  is an American rock band that played in the 1990s and early 2000s.", "full_text": "Stone Temple Pilots  is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland , brothers Dean  and Robert DeLeo , and Eric Kretz . Since the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the dismissal of Weiland in 2013, who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington. In 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park. On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts.\nAfter forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. The band found immediate success in 1993 upon releasing their debut album, Core , and went on to become one of the most commercially successful bands of the 1990s. The band released four more studio albums: Purple , Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop , No. 4  and Shangri-La Dee Da , before separating in 2002, after which the band members partook in various projects . The band eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released a new self-titled album in 2010, and have been actively touring since, even after Weiland was fired from the band. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP High Rise in 2013.\nWhile initially displaying a sound typically identified as grunge early on in its career, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova and classic rock. The band's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved several tumultuous periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.", "title": "Stone Temple Pilots"}
