{"summary": "Nuclear engineering is a field of engineering dealing with application of atomic nuclei breakdown and other sub-atomic physics, based on the principles of nuclear physics.", "full_text": "Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of the breakdown  as well as the fusion of atomic nuclei and/or the application of other sub-atomic physics, based on the principles of nuclear physics. In the sub-field of nuclear fission, it particularly includes the interaction and maintenance of systems and components like nuclear reactors, nuclear power plants, and/or nuclear weapons. The field also includes the study of medical and other applications of  radiation, nuclear safety, heat/thermodynamics transport, nuclear fuel and/or other related technology , and the problems of nuclear proliferation.", "title": "Nuclear engineering"}
