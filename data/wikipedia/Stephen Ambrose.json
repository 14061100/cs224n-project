{"summary": "1993  was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Stephen Edward Ambrose  was an American historian and biographer of U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon. He was a longtime professor of history at the University of New Orleans and the author of many best selling volumes of American popular history.\nBeginning late in his life and continuing after his death, however, evidence and reports have continued to surface documenting longtime patterns of plagiarism and inaccuracies in many of his published writings and other work. In response to one of the early reports, Ambrose said he was not \"out there stealing other people's writings.\" In the wake of his death, a reviewer for the New York Times did not absolve him completely, but opined that \"he certainly deserved better from some of his envious peers\" and credited the historian with reaching \"an important lay audience without endorsing its every prejudice or sacrificing the profession's standards of scholarship.\"", "title": "Stephen Ambrose"}
