{"summary": "The Hughes Medal is awarded by the Royal Society of London \"in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications\".", "full_text": "Sir Alfred Brian Pippard, ScD, FRS , was a British physicist. He was Cavendish Professor of Physics from 1971 until 1984 and an Honorary Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, of which he was the first President. He was educated at Clifton College.\nPippard demonstrated the reality, as opposed to the mere abstract concept, of Fermi surfaces in metals by establishing the shape of the Fermi surface of copper through measuring the reflection and absorption of microwave electromagnetic radiation . He also introduced the notion of coherence length in superconductors in his proposal for the non-local generalisation of the Londons' equations concerning electrodynamics in superfluids and superconductors. The non-local kernel proposed by Pippard, inferred on the basis of Chambers' non-local generalisation of Ohm's law can be deduced within the framework of the BCS  theory of superconductivity .\nPippard was the author of Elements of Classical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics, Dynamics of Conduction Electrons, and The Physics of Vibration. He is also a co-author of the three-volumes encyclopaedia Twentieth Century Physics. As the Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, he complied Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics, based in large part on past examination questions for Cambridge physics students.\nPippard was the doctoral supervisor of Brian David Josephson  who in 1973 received the Nobel Prize in Physics  for his discovery of what is known as the Josephson effect.", "title": "Brian Pippard"}
