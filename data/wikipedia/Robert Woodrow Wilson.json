The award purse was also shared with a third scientist, Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa, for unrelated work.\nWhile working on a new type of antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel Township, New Jersey, they found a source of noise in the atmosphere that they could not explain. After removing all potential sources of noise, including pigeon droppings on the antenna, the noise was finally identified as CMB, which served as important corroboration of the Big Bang theory.", "title": "Robert Woodrow Wilson"}
