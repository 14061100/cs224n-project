{"summary": "Electromagnetic induction is where a voltage or current is produced in a conductor by a changing magnetic flux.", "full_text": "Electromagnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across a conductor exposed to time varying magnetic fields. Michael Faraday, who mathematically described Faraday's law of induction, is generally credited with its discovery in 1831.", "title": "Electromagnetic induction"}
