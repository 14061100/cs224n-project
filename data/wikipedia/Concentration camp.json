{"summary": "A concentration camp is a place which a government uses to keep people who are either against that government or who it thinks are too dangerous to remain free.", "full_text": "Internment is the imprisonment or confinement of people, commonly in large groups, without trial. Collins English dictionary adds that the term is especially used for the confinement \"of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects\". Thus, while it can simply mean imprisonment, it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement after having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.\nInterned persons may be held at prisons or at facilities known as internment camps. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as concentration camps.\nInternment also refers to the practice of neutral countries in time of war in detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment in their territories under the Hague Convention of 1907.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"", "title": "Concentration camp"}
