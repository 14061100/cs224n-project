{"summary": "A definition is an exact word or phrase of the meaning, nature, or limits of something.", "full_text": "A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term .  Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions  and extensional definitions . A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, instead of describing a pre-existing term. Definitions and axioms are the basis on which all of mathematics is constructed.", "title": "Definition"}
