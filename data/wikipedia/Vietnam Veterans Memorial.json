{"summary": "The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, also called the Wall, honors the men and women who died in the Vietnam War.", "full_text": "The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a 2-acre  national memorial in Washington, DC. It honors U.S. service members of the U.S. armed forces who fought in the Vietnam War, service members who died in service in Vietnam/South East Asia, and those service members who were unaccounted for  during the War.\nIts construction and related issues have been the source of controversies, some of which have resulted in additions to the memorial complex. The memorial currently consists of three separate parts: the Three Servicemen Memorial, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall, which is the best-known part of the memorial.\nThe main part of the memorial, which was completed in 1982, is in Constitution Gardens adjacent to the National Mall, just northeast of the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service, and receives around 3 million visitors each year. The Memorial Wall was designed by American architect Maya Lin. In 2007, it was ranked tenth on the \"List of America's Favorite Architecture\" by the American Institute of Architects. As a National Memorial it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.", "title": "Vietnam Veterans Memorial"}
