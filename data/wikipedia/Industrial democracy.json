{"summary": "Socialism is an economic system where the means of producing wealth  are owned by society as a whole, meaning the value produced belongs to everyone in society as opposed to a small class of private owners.", "full_text": "Industrial democracy is an arrangement which involves workers making decisions, sharing responsibility and authority in the workplace. While in participative management organizational designs workers are listened to and take part in the decision-making process, in organizations employing industrial democracy they also have the final decisive power .\nIn company law, the term generally used is co-determination, following the German word Mitbestimmung. In German companies with more than 1000 employees  resp. more than 2000 employees  half of the supervisory board of directors  is elected by the shareholders, and the other half by the workers.\nAlthough industrial democracy generally refers to the organization model in which workplaces are run directly by the people who work in them in place of private or state ownership of the means of production, there are also representative forms of industrial democracy. Representative industrial democracy includes decision-making structures such as the formation of committees and consultative bodies to facilitate communication between management, unions, and staff.", "title": "Industrial democracy"}
