{"summary": "ICBM is an acronym.", "full_text": "An intercontinental ballistic missile  is a guided ballistic missile with a minimum range of more than 5,500 kilometres  primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery . Similarly conventional, chemical and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs. Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles , allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target.\nEarly ICBMs had limited accuracy  that allowed them to be used only against the largest targets such as cities. They were seen as a \"safe\" basing option, one that would keep the deterrent force close to home where it would be difficult to attack. Attacks against  military targets, if desired, still demanded the use of a more precise manned bomber. This is due to the inverse-square law, which predicts that the amount of energy dispersed from a single point release of energy  dissipates by the inverse of the square of distance from the single point of release. The result is that the power of a nuclear explosion to rupture hardened structures is greatly decreased by the distance from the impact point of the nuclear weapon. So a near-direct hit is generally necessary, as only diminishing returns are gained by increasing bomb yield.\nSecond- and third-generation designs  dramatically improved accuracy to the point where even the smallest point targets can be successfully attacked.\nICBMs are differentiated by having greater range and speed than other ballistic missiles: intermediate-range ballistic missiles , medium-range ballistic missiles , short-range ballistic missiles  . There is no single, standardized definition of what ranges would be categorized as intercontinental, intermediate, medium, or short.", "title": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}
