{"summary": "9-1-1 or 911  is the emergency telephone number for the United States, Canada, and Argentina.", "full_text": "The North American Numbering Plan  is a telephone numbering plan that encompasses 25 distinct regions in twenty countries primarily in North America, including the Caribbean and the U.S. territories. Not all North American countries participate in the NANP. Each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has plenary control over local numbering resources.\nThe NANP was originally devised in the 1940s by AT&T for the Bell System to unify the diverse local numbering plans that had been established in the preceding decades. Since shortly after the breakup of the Bell System, the numbering plan has been administered by the North American Numbering Plan Administration , a service that is procured from the private sector by the Federal Communications Commission  in the United States. The FCC also serves as the U.S. regulator. Canadian numbering decisions are made by the Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium.\nThe NANP divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas  which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly called the area code. Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit telephone number unique only within its respective plan area consisting of a three-digit central office code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the public switched telephone network . For international call routing, the NANP has been assigned the international calling code 1 by the International Telecommunications Union . The North American Numbering Plan conforms with ITU Recommendation E.164, which establishes an international numbering framework.", "title": "Telephone numbers in the United States"}
