{"summary": "George Fitzgerald Smoot III  is an American professor of astrophysics and cosmology.", "full_text": "In astronomy and observational cosmology, The BOOMERanG experiment  was an experiment which measured the cosmic microwave background radiation of a part of the sky during three sub-orbital  balloon flights. It was the first experiment to make large, high fidelity images of the CMB temperature anisotropies, and is best known for the discovery in 2000 that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, with similar results from the competing MAXIMA experiment.\nBy using a telescope which flew at over 42,000 meters high, it was possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allowed massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a tiny part of the sky could be scanned.\nThe first was a test flight over North America in 1997. In the two subsequent flights in 1998 and 2003 the balloon was launched from McMurdo Station in the Antarctic. It was carried by the Polar vortex winds in a circle around the South Pole, returning after two weeks. From this phenomenon the telescope took its name.\nThe BOOMERanG team was led by Andrew E. Lange of Caltech and Paolo de Bernardis of the University of Rome La Sapienza.", "title": "MAXIMA experiment"}
