{"summary": "The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the United States of America.", "full_text": "The Supreme Court of the United States  is the highest federal court of the United States. Established pursuant to Article III of the United States Constitution in 1789, it has ultimate  appellate jurisdiction over all federal courts and over state court cases involving issues of federal law, plus original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is the final interpreter of federal constitutional law, although it may only act within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction.\nThe Court consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Once appointed, justices have life tenure unless they resign, retire, take senior status, or are removed after impeachment . In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. Each justice has one vote, and while many cases are decided unanimously, many of the highest profile cases often expose ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories. The Court meets in the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C.\n^ Safire, William, \"On language: POTUS and FLOTUS,\" New York Times, October 12, 1997.
