{"summary": "Yugoslavia was a country in Europe, mostly in Balkan Peninsula, its meaning South Slavs deriving from Slavs who came from area what is now Poland in 7th century.", "full_text": "The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's  military operation against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. According to NATO, the operation sought to stop human rights abuses in Kosovo, and it was the first time that the organisation used military force without the approval of the UN Security Council. The air strikes lasted from March 24, 1999 to June 10, 1999. The official NATO operation code name was Operation Allied Force; the United States called it Operation Noble Anvil, while in Yugoslavia the operation was incorrectly called \"Merciful Angel\" , as a result of a misunderstanding or mistranslation.\nThe NATO bombing marked the second major combat operation in its history, following the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 1999 bombings led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo and the establishment of UNMIK, a U.N. mission in Kosovo.\nThe bombing killed between 489 and 528 civilians, and destroyed bridges, industrial plants, public buildings, private businesses, as well as, barracks and military installations.", "title": "1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia"}
