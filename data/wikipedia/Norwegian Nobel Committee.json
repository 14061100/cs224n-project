{"summary": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee is the group which gives the Nobel Peace Prize every year.", "full_text": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee  selects the recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize each year on behalf of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's estate, based on instructions of Nobel's will.\nIts five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament and today roughly represent the political makeup of that body. In his will, Alfred Nobel tasked the Parliament of Norway with selecting the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize. At the time, Norway and Sweden were in a loose personal union. Despite its members being appointed by parliament, the committee is a private body tasked with awarding a private prize. In recent decades, most committee members have been retired politicians.\nThe committee is assisted by the Norwegian Nobel Institute, its secretariat, and the committee holds their meetings in the institute's building, where the winner is also announced. The award ceremony, however, takes place in Oslo City Hall .", "title": "Norwegian Nobel Committee"}
