{"summary": "Jacob \"Jack\" Kevorkian , mostly known as \"Dr.", "full_text": "Jack Kevorkian , was an American pathologist, euthanasia activist, painter, author, composer, and instrumentalist. He is best known for publicly championing a terminal patient's right to die via physician-assisted suicide; he claimed to have assisted at least 130 patients to that end. He was often portrayed in the media as \"Dr. Death\"; however, many consider him a hero as he helped set the platform for reform. He famously said, \"Dying is not a crime.\"\nIn 1999, Kevorkian was arrested and tried for his direct role in a case of voluntary euthanasia. He was convicted of second-degree murder and served eight years of a 10-to-25-year prison sentence. He was released on parole on June 1, 2007, on condition he would not offer advice nor participate nor be present in the act of any type of suicide involving euthanasia to any other person; as well as neither promote nor talk about the procedure of assisted suicide.\nAs an oil painter and a jazz musician, Kevorkian marketed limited quantities of his visual and musical artwork to the public.", "title": "Jack Kevorkian"}
