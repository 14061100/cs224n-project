{"summary": "Dipole can mean two things in physics.", "full_text": "In physics, the electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative electrical charges in a system of electric charges, that is, a measure of the charge system's overall polarity. The SI units are Coulomb-meter . This article is limited to static phenomena, and does not describe time-dependent or dynamic polarization. The magnitude of dipole moment determines the electric field strength.", "title": "Electric dipole moment"}
