{"summary": "Religious studies  is the academic study of religious beliefs, behaviors, and institutions from a secular viewpoint.", "full_text": "In secular usage, religious education is the teaching of a particular religion  and its varied aspects: its beliefs, doctrines, rituals, customs, rites, and personal roles. In Western and secular culture, religious education implies a type of education which is largely separate from academia, and which  regards religious belief as a fundamental tenet and operating modality, as well as a prerequisite for attendance.\nThe secular concept is substantially different from societies that adhere to religious law, wherein \"religious education\" connotes the dominant academic study, and in typically religious terms, teaches doctrines which define social customs as \"laws\" and the violations thereof as \"crimes\", or else misdemeanors requiring punitive correction.", "title": "Religious education"}
