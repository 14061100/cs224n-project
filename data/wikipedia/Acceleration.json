{"summary": "Acceleration is a measure of how fast velocity changes.", "full_text": "Acceleration, in physics, is the rate of change of velocity of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newton's Second Law. The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared . Accelerations are vector quantities  and add according to the parallelogram law. As a vector, the calculated net force is equal to the product of the object's mass  and the acceleration.\nFor example, when a car starts from a standstill  and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction. For this example, we can call the accelerating of the car forward a \"linear acceleration\", which passengers in the car might experience as force pushing them back into their seats. When changing directions, we might call this \"non-linear acceleration\", which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called deceleration. Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them away from their seats. Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration, as both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations  might be felt by passengers until their velocity  match that of the car.\n^ Crew, Henry . The Principles of Mechanics. BiblioBazaar, LLC. p. 43.
