{"summary": "Platonic realism is the theory of reality developed by Plato, and explained in his theory of Forms.", "full_text": "Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what it might be taken to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be explained?\" The debate over what the success of science centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables  as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism.", "title": "Scientific realism"}
