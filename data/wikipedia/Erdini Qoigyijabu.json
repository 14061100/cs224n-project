He is also the vice president of the Buddhist Association of China.\nNorbu was selected by the drawing of his name from a Golden Urn, a method used in the selection of, for example, the 11th Dalai Lama and the 8th Panchen Lama. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy selected by the 14th Dalai Lama and Chadrel Rinpoche, the then-incumbent abbott of Tashilhunpo Monastery, has been detained in a series of unknown locations by the Chinese Government since the exile government selected him. Neither the Chinese nor the Tibetan exile governments recognize each other's selection for the Panchen Lama.\n^ Gyatso, Tenzin . \"Reincarnation\". His Holiness The 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Dharamsala. Retrieved 26 April 2015. The Golden Urn system was actually used only in the cases of the Eleventh and Twelfth Dalai Lamas.
