{"summary": "Wolfgang Ernst Pauli  was an Austrian theoretical physicist known for his work on spin theory, and for the discovery of the pauli exclusion principle, which is important for the structure of matter and the whole of chemistry.", "full_text": "Wolfgang Ernst Pauli  was an Austrian-born Swiss theoretical physicist and one of the pioneers of quantum physics. In 1945, after having been nominated by Albert Einstein, Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"decisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principle or Pauli principle.\" The discovery involved spin theory, which is the basis of a theory of the structure of matter.", "title": "Wolfgang Pauli"}
