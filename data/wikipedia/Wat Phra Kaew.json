It was enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew temple in 1782 during the reign of Phutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I . This marked the beginning of the Chakri Dynasty of Thailand, whose present sovereign is Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Rama IX.\nThe Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about 66 centimetres  tall, carved from a single jade stone . It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the Lanna school of the northern Thailand.
