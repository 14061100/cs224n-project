{"summary": "Liberal arts is the term given to an education based on classical antiquity.", "full_text": "The liberal arts  are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person  to know in order to take an active part in civic life, something that  included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were the core liberal arts, while arithmetic, geometry, the theory of music, and astronomy also played a  part in education.\nIn modern times, liberal arts education is a term that can be interpreted in different ways. It can refer to certain areas of literature, languages, art history, music history, philosophy, history, mathematics, psychology, and science. It can also refer to studies on a liberal arts degree program. For example, Harvard University offers a Master of Liberal Arts degree, which covers biological and social sciences as well as the humanities. For both interpretations, the term generally refers to matters not relating to the professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.", "title": "Liberal arts"}
