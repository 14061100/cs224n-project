{"summary": "The International System of Units is the standard modern form of the metric system.", "full_text": "The International System of Units  defines seven units of measure as a basic set from which all other SI units are derived. The SI base units and their physical quantities are:\nmetre for length\nkilogram for mass\nsecond for time\nampere for electric current\nkelvin for temperature\ncandela for luminous intensity\nmole for the amount of substance\nThe SI base quantities form a set of mutually independent dimensions as required by dimensional analysis commonly employed in science and technology. However, in a given realization in these units they may well be interdependent, i.e. defined in terms of each other.\nThe names and symbols of SI base units are written in lowercase , except the symbols of those named after persons which are written with an initial capital letter .\nMany other units, such as the litre , are formally not part of the SI, but are accepted for use with SI.\n\n", "title": "SI base unit"}
