{"summary": "Calculus is a branch of mathematics which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a function.", "full_text": "Calculus is the mathematical study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. It has two major branches, differential calculus , and integral calculus ; these two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. Generally, modern calculus is considered to have been developed in the 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering and economics and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot.\nCalculus is a part of modern mathematics education. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has historically been called \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", or \"infinitesimal calculus\". The word \"calculus\" comes from Latin  and refers to a small stone used for counting. More generally, calculus  refers to any method or system of calculation guided by the symbolic manipulation of expressions. Some examples of other well-known calculi are propositional calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.\n^ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differential%20calculus\n^ http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integral+calculus?show=0&t=1421520369\n^ Fisher, Irving .
