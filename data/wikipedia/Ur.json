{"summary": "Ur was the one of the world's first cities, in Mesopotamia.", "full_text": "Ur  was an important Sumerian city-state in ancient Mesopotamia, located at the site of modern Tell el-Muqayyar  in south Iraq's Dhi Qar Governorate. Although Ur was once a coastal city near the mouth of the Euphrates on the Persian Gulf, the coastline has shifted and the city is now well inland, south of the Euphrates on its right bank, 16 kilometres  from Nasiriyah.\nThe city dates from the Ubaid period circa 3800 BC, and is recorded in written history as a City State from the 26th century BC, its first recorded king being Mesh-Ane-pada. The city's patron deity was Nanna , the Sumerian and Akkadian  moon god, and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god's name, URIM2KI being the classical Sumerian spelling of LAK-32.UNUGKI, literally \"the abode  of Nanna \".\nThe site is marked by the partially restored ruins of the Ziggurat of Ur, which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC , during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by Nabonidus, the Assyrian born last king of Babylon. The ruins cover an area of 1,200 metres  northwest to southeast by 800 metres  northeast to southwest and rise up to about 20 metres  above the present plain level.", "title": "Ur"}
