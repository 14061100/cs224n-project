Among its applications, it afforded insight into regression to the mean or \"regression to mediocrity\".\nThe machine consists of a vertical board with interleaved rows of pins. Balls are dropped from the top, and bounce left and right as they hit the pins. Eventually, they are collected into one-ball-wide bins at the bottom. The height of ball columns in the bins approximates a bell curve.\nOverlaying Pascal's triangle onto the pins shows the number of different paths that can be taken to get to each bin.\nA large-scale working model of this device can be seen at the Museum of Science, Boston in the Mathematica exhibit .\n^ Galton, Sir Francis .
