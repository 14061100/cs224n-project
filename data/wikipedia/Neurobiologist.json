{"summary": "Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system.", "full_text": "A neuroscientist is a trained scientist  who studies the scientific field of neuroscience or any of its related sub-fields. Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field encompassing study in fields such as biology, chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, engineering, and mathematics. Any individual from these fields who contributes to neuroscience-related research can be considered a neuroscientist.\nThese scientists generally work as researchers within a college, university, government agency, or private industry setting. In research-oriented careers, neuroscientists typically spend their time designing and carrying out scientific experiments that contribute to our knowledge of the nervous system and its function. Neuroscientists can engage in basic or applied research. Basic research seeks to add information to our current understanding of the nervous system, whereas applied research seeks to address a specific problem, such as developing a treatment for a neurological disorder. Biomedically-oriented neuroscientists typically engage in applied research. Neuroscientists also have a number of career opportunities outside the realm of research, including careers in science writing, government program management, science advocacy, and secondary education. These individuals most commonly hold doctorate degrees in the sciences, but may also hold a masters or medical degree.", "title": "Neurobiologist"}
