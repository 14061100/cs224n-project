{"summary": "1990  was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "The Cardinal and Theological Virtues is a fresco by Raphael as part of his Stanza della Segnatura in the Palazzi Vaticani in Vatican City. It is 6.6m wide at the base. The cardinal virtues are personified as three women in a bucolic landscape, and the theological virtues by cupids:\nFortitude, a woman holding an oak branch, with the branch shaken by the cupid Charity\nPrudence, with two faces, looking in a mirror, with a cupid Hope behind her holding a flaming torch\nTemperance, holding reins in her hand, guarding a cupid Faith, who points at the sky with his right hand\nAnother interpretation might see Prudence as holding the reins and Temperance with two faces. Prudence is traditionally called auriga virtutum ; it guides the other virtues by setting rule and measure and Temperance moderates the attraction of the pleasures of the senses and provides balance in the use of created goods. See the Catechism of the Catholic Church .", "title": "The Cardinal Virtues"}
