The capital is Roseau, located on the leeward side of the island.\nThe island was discovered by the Spanish, but colonised predominately by the French. Great Britain took it over in 1763 after the Seven Years' War and gradually established English as the official language. The island republic gained independence in 1978.\nIts name is pronounced with emphasis on the third syllable, related to its former Dominique. Dominica has been nicknamed the \"Nature Isle of the Caribbean\" for its unspoiled natural beauty. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by geothermal-volcanic activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest hot spring, Boiling Lake. The island has lush mountainous rainforests, and is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The Sisserou parrot , is found only on Dominica and is the island's national bird and features on the national flag. Dominica's economy depends on tourism and agriculture.", "title": "Dominica"}
