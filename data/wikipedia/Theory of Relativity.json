{"summary": "The theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in the early 1900s.", "full_text": "The theory of relativity, or simply relativity in physics, usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity.\nConcepts introduced by the theories of relativity include:\nMeasurements of various quantities are relative to the velocities of observers. In particular, space contracts and time dilates.\nSpacetime: space and time should be considered together and in relation to each other.\nSpace is a physical entity that can be changed, space is not just nothing, space can affect mass \nThe speed of light is nonetheless invariant, the same for all observers.\nThe term \"theory of relativity\" was based on the expression \"relative theory\"  used in 1906 by Max Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression \"theory of relativity\" .", "title": "Theory of Relativity"}
