{"summary": "In geography, a plain is a large area of land with no hills or mountains.", "full_text": "The Pannonian Basin or Carpathian Basin is a large basin in East-Central Europe. The geomorphological term Pannonian Plain is more widely used for roughly the same region though with a somewhat different sense - meaning only the lowlands, the plain that remained when the Pliocene Pannonian Sea dried out. It is a geomorphological subsystem of the Alps-Himalaya system. Most of the plain consists of the Great Hungarian Plain  and the Little Hungarian Plain , divided by the Transdanubian Mountains.\nThe Pannonian Basin is situated in the southeastern part of Central Europe, or at the boundary between Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe . It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, the Dinarides and the Balkan mountains. The Rivers Danube and Tisza divide the basin roughly in half. It extends roughly between Vienna in the northwest, Zagreb in the southwest, Belgrade in the southeast and Satu Mare in the northeast.\nIn terms of modern state boundaries, the basin is centred in the territory of Hungary, but it also extends to Northern Serbia, Central Croatia and Slavonia, western Slovakia, the Eastern Slovak Lowland , besides the border regions of northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, some western portions of Romania, and the eastern tips of Slovenia and Austria. The name \"Pannonian\" is taken from that of Pannonia, a province of the Roman Empire. Only Western part of the territory of modern Hungary  was part of the ancient Pannonia province, which is less than 29% of modern Hungary, therefore Hungarian geographers avoid the Pannonian Basin and Pannonian Plain terms.", "title": "Pannonian Plain"}
