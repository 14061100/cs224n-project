{"summary": "Biophysics is a science where the laws of physics are used to study biology, the science on life and living things.", "full_text": "Biophysics is an interdisciplinary science using methods of, and theories from, physics to study biological systems. Biophysics spans all scales of biological organization, from the molecular scale to whole organisms and ecosystems. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering, computational biology and  systems biology. It has been suggested as a bridge between biology and physics.\nThe term \"biophysics\" was originally introduced by Karl Pearson in 1892.", "title": "Biophysics"}
