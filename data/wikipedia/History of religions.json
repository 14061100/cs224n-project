This period of religious history begins with the invention of writing about 5,200 years ago .

The timeline of religion is a comparative chronology of religion.\nThe word \"religion\" as it is used today does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that \"what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history\". The history of other cultures' interaction with the religious category is therefore their interaction with an idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of Christianity.", "title": "History of religions"}
