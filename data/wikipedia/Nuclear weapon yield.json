{"summary": "A nuclear weapon is a weapon that suddenly releases the energy in the nucleus of certain types of atoms.", "full_text": "The explosive yield of a nuclear weapon is the amount of energy discharged when a nuclear weapon is detonated, expressed usually in TNT equivalent , either in kilotons  or megatons , but sometimes also in terajoules . Because the precise amount of energy released by TNT is and was subject to measurement uncertainties, especially at the dawn of the Atomic Age, the accepted convention is that one kt of TNT is simply defined to be 1012 calories equivalent, this being very roughly equal to the energy yield of 1,000 tons of TNT.\nThe yield-to-weight ratio is the amount of weapon yield compared to the mass of the weapon. The practical maximum yield-to-weight ratio for fusion weapons  has been estimated to 6 megatons of TNT per metric ton of bomb mass . Yields of 5.2 megatons/ton and higher have been reported for large weapons constructed for single-warhead use in the early 1960s. Since this time, the smaller warheads needed to achieve the increased net damage efficiency  of multiple warhead systems, has resulted in decreases in the yield/weight ratio for single modern warheads.\n^ The B-41 Bomb", "title": "Nuclear weapon yield"}
