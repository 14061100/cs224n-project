{"summary": "World Chess Champions are players who have won a match or tournament for the World Championship at chess.", "full_text": "The World Chess Championship  is played to determine the World Champion in chess.\nThe official world championship is generally regarded to have begun in 1886, when the two leading players in Europe and the United States, Johann Zukertort and Wilhelm Steinitz respectively, played a match. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion. From 1948 to 1993, the championship was administered by FIDE, the World Chess Federation. In 1993, the reigning champion  broke away from FIDE, which led to the creation of the rival PCA championship. The titles were unified at the World Chess Championship 2006.\nCurrent world champion Magnus Carlsen won the World Chess Championship 2013 against Viswanathan Anand and successfully defended his title against Anand in the World Chess Championship 2014.\nIn addition, there is a separate event for women only, for the title of Women's World Champion, as well as separate competitions and titles for juniors , seniors , and computers. Computers are barred from competing for all titles, except the last one.", "title": "World Chess Championship"}
