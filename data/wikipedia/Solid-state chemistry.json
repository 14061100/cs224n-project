{"summary": "Solid-state chemistry,  is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials.", "full_text": "Solid-state chemistry, also sometimes referred to as materials chemistry, is the study of the synthesis, structure, and properties of solid phase materials, particularly, but not necessarily exclusively of, non-molecular solids. It therefore has a strong overlap with solid-state physics, mineralogy, crystallography, ceramics, metallurgy, thermodynamics, materials science and electronics with a focus on the synthesis of novel materials and their characterization.\n\n", "title": "Solid-state chemistry"}
