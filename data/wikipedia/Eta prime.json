{"summary": "Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or ETA  is a terrorist nationalist militant organization.", "full_text": "The eta  and eta prime meson  are mesons made of a mixture of up, down and strange quarks and their antiquarks. The charmed eta meson  and bottom eta meson  are forms of quarkonium; they have the same spin and parity as the light eta but are made of charm quarks and bottom quarks respectively. The top quark is too heavy to form a similar meson, due to its very fast decay.", "title": "Eta prime"}
