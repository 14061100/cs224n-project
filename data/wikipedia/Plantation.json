{"summary": "A plantation is a large farm which is specialized on farming one type of crop.", "full_text": "A plantation is a large piece of land  usually in a tropical or semitropical area where one crop is specifically planted for widespread commercial sale and usually tended by resident laborers. The crops grown include fast-growing trees , cotton, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, sisal, oil seeds , rubber trees, and various fruits. Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations were located.\nAmong the earliest examples of plantations were the latifundia of the Roman Empire, which produced large quantities of wine and olive oil for export. Plantation agriculture grew rapidly with the increase in international trade and the development of a worldwide economy that followed the expansion of European colonial empires. Like every economic activity, it has changed over time. Earlier forms of plantation agriculture were associated with large disparities of wealth and income, foreign ownership and political influence, and exploitative social systems such as indentured labour and slavery.", "title": "Plantation"}
