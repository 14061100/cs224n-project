{"summary": "Wayne's World is a 1992 American comedy movie from Paramount Pictures, starring Mike Myers and Dana Carvey.", "full_text": "Wayne's World was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled \"Wayne's Power Minute\"  on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned two films, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell , an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar . Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show \"live\" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first \"Wayne's World\" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of 1988/1989.\n^ \"Metalheads Of 'Wayne's World' Are Headed For The Big Screen\". Chicago Tribune. 1991-08-17.
