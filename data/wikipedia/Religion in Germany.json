However, the 2011 census reported a slightly higher percentage of 66.8% for adherents of Christianity. The second largest religion is Islam with approximately 4 million adherents , of which 1 million  have German citizenship. There is also a smaller but growing presence of other religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism.\nDuring the last decades, the two largest churches, namely the Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany and the Roman Catholic Church, have lost significant number of adherents. Both accounted for about 29% of the population in 2014. An estimated 33.5% of the country's population is not affiliated with any church or religion and around 1% of the population belongs to some other religious group. Since the reunification of Germany the number of non-religious people has grown, especially because of the former East Germany was a communist puppet state. Various churches were put under the pressure by the communist government for roughly 40 years, resulting in people's abandonment of religion.", "title": "Religion in Germany"}
