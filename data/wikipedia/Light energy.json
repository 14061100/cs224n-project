{"summary": "Solar energy is energy that is present in sunlight.", "full_text": "In radiometry, radiant energy is the energy of electromagnetic radiation. The SI unit of radiant energy is the joule . The quantity of radiant energy may be calculated by integrating radiant flux  with respect to time. The symbol Qe is often used throughout literature to denote radiant energy . In branches of physics other than radiometry, electromagnetic energy is referred to using E or W. The term is used particularly when electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a source into the surrounding environment. This radiation may be visible or invisible to the human eye.", "title": "Light energy"}
