The first working laser was a ruby laser made by Theodore H. \"Ted\" Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories on May 16, 1960.\nRuby lasers produce pulses of coherent visible light at a wavelength of 694.3 nm, which is a deep red color. Typical ruby laser pulse lengths are on the order of a millisecond.", "title": "Ruby laser"}
