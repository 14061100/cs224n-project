{"summary": "Private property is a concept used in law.", "full_text": "Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities. Private property is distinguishable from public property, which is owned by a state entity; and collective property, which is owned by a group of non-governmental entities. Private property is further distinguished from personal property, which refers to property for personal use and consumption. Private property is a legal concept that is defined and enforced by the political system.\nCategorization of collective property can be indeterminable, such as in a not-for-profit private university; or determinable, such as in the case of a legal partnership.\n^ McConnell, Campbell; Brue, Stanley; Flynn, Sean .

That is, private property is defined and exists only because of politics.", "title": "Private property"}
