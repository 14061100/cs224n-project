{"summary": "The Passion of the Christ is the title of a movie that was produced and directed by Mel Gibson based on sister Catherine Emmerich's visions.", "full_text": "The Passion of the Christ  is a 2004 American epic biblical drama film directed by Mel Gibson and starring Jim Caviezel as Jesus Christ. It depicts the Passion of Jesus largely according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. It also draws on pious accounts such as the Friday of Sorrows along with other devotional writings, such as those attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich.\nThe film covers primarily the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, beginning with the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane, the insomnia and grievance of the Virgin Mary, but ending with a brief depiction of his resurrection. Flashbacks of Jesus as a child and as a young man with Mary his mother, giving the Sermon on the Mount, teaching the Twelve Apostles, and at the Last Supper are some of the images depicted. The film was shot in Italy, and the dialogue is entirely in reconstructed vernacular Hebrew and Latin with subtitles.\nThe film has been controversial and received mixed reviews, with some critics claiming that the extreme violence in the film \"obscures its message.\" Catholic sources have questioned the authenticity of the non-biblical material upon which the film drew. The film, however, was a major commercial hit, grossing in excess of $600 million during its theatrical release. The Passion of the Christ is the highest grossing R-rated film in United States history, the highest grossing religious film, and the highest grossing non-English-language film of all time.", "title": "The Passion of the Christ"}
