{"summary": "Pentium  is an x86 microprocessor.", "full_text": "Pentium is a brand used for a series of x86-compatible microprocessors produced by Intel. In its current form, a Pentium processor is an entry-level product that Intel rates as \"two stars\", meaning that it is above the low-end Atom and Celeron products but below the faster Core i3, i5 and i7 lines as well as the high-end Xeon processors.\n\nThe name Pentium is originally derived from the Greek word pente , meaning \"five\" , and the Latin ending -ium. The current Pentium processors only share the name but are in fact based on the same processor chips that are used in the Intel Core but are typically used with a lower clock frequency, a partially disabled L3 cache and some of the advanced features such as hyper-threading and virtualization disabled.\n^ \"Processor Rating\".
