The term is sometimes used to refer to a cessation of all hostility amongst all humanity. For example, World Peace could be crossing boundaries via human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine, diplomats and/or an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the United Nations and the 5 permanent members of its Security Council  have worked to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. However, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since that time.", "title": "World peace"}
