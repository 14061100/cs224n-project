{"summary": "Musicology means the study of music by a scholar.", "full_text": "Musicology  is the scholarly analysis of, and research on, music, a part of humanities. A person who studies music is a musicologist. For broad treatments, see the entry on \"musicology\" in Grove's dictionary, the entry on \"Musikwissenschaft\" in Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, and the classic approach of Adler .\nTraditionally, historical musicology  has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and systematic musicology are approximately equal in size. Ethnomusicology is the study of non-Western music. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. Cognitive musicology is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, music education is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with teacher education, educational research, and related fields.", "title": "Musicology"}
