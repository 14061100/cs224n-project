{"summary": "A variable star is a star that is sometimes brighter or dimmer.", "full_text": "A variable star is a star whose brightness as seen from Earth  fluctuates.\nThis variation may be caused by a change in emitted light or by something partly blocking the light, so variable stars are classified as either:\nIntrinsic variables, whose luminosity actually changes; for example, because the star periodically swells and shrinks.\nExtrinsic variables, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it.\nMany, possibly most, stars have at least some variation in luminosity: the energy output of our Sun, for example, varies by about 0.1% over an 11-year solar cycle.", "title": "Variable star"}
