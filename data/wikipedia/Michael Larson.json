{"summary": "1984  was a leap year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Paul Michael Larson  was a contestant on the American television game show Press Your Luck in 1984. Larson is notable for winning $110,237  in cash and prizes, at the time the largest one-day total ever won on a game show. He was able to win by memorizing the patterns used on the Press Your Luck game board.\nOriginally from southwestern Ohio, Larson used his cash winnings for taxes and real estate investments. However, he also had problems with the law and was involved in illegal schemes. As a result, Larson lost all of his winnings within two years of the show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired the 2003 Game Show Network documentary Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal.", "title": "Michael Larson"}
