{"summary": "Many philosophies and religions say that a soul is the part of a living human being which is supernatural and lives after death.", "full_text": "The soul, in many religious, philosophical and mythological traditions, is the incorporeal and, in many conceptions, immortal essence of a living thing. According to most of the Abrahamic religions, only human beings have immortal souls. For example, the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas attributed \"soul\"  to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal. Other religions  teach that all biological organisms have souls, while the rest teach that even non-biological entities  possess souls. This latter belief is called animism.\nGreek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle understood the psyche  to be crowned with the logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teachings as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence .\nAnima mundi is the concept of a \"world soul\" connecting all living organisms on the planet.", "title": "Soul"}
