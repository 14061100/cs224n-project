{"summary": "The Bundesversammlung, or Federal Convention, is a special federal body in Germany.", "full_text": "The Federal Convention, also known as the Federal Assembly , is a special constitutional body in the political and federal institutional system of Germany, convened solely for the purpose of electing the President of the Federal Republic of Germany , either every five years or within 30 days of the premature termination of a presidential term. The Federal Convention mirrors the aggregated majority situation of the Bundestag and the parliaments of the 16 German federal states.\nThe Basic Law mandates that a maximum of three votes can be held. On the first two rounds a candidate must receive an absolute majority of delegates to be elected. After that, in the third round, a plurality of all delegates voting is sufficient for election to the office of Federal President. Any delegate may nominate candidates; unusually every parliamentary group puts forth candidates, and there may sometimes be consensus candidates who are supported by several of the major parties.", "title": "Bundesversammlung (Germany)"}
