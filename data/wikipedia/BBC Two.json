It covers a wide range of subject matter, but tending towards more \"highbrow\" programmes than the more mainstream and popular BBC One. Like the BBC's other domestic TV and radio channels, it is funded by the television licence, and is therefore commercial-free. It is a comparatively well-funded public service network, regularly attaining a much higher audience share than most public service networks worldwide.\nOriginally styled BBC2, it was the third British television station to be launched , and from 1 July 1967, Europe's first television channel to broadcast regularly in colour. It was envisaged as a home for less mainstream and more ambitious programming, and while this tendency has continued to date, most special-interest programmes of a kind previously broadcast on BBC Two, for example the BBC Proms, now tend to appear on BBC Four instead.\nA high-definition version of the channel launched on 26 March 2013, replacing BBC HD.\n^ \"BBC Two HD channel goes live, replacing BBC HD\".
