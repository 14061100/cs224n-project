It is the territory's second oldest institution of higher learning, and the only collegiate university. The University was originally founded as a federation of three existing colleges, Chung Chi College, New Asia College and United College, the oldest of which was founded in 1949.\nToday, CUHK is organised into nine constituent colleges and eight academic faculties. Though the original University Charter stipulates Chinese as the principal language, English is currently the main medium of instruction, with Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese retained by a minority of colleges and departments only. As of 2013, four Nobel laureates are associated with the University, making it the only tertiary institution in the territory with recipients of the Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Medal and Veblen Prize as faculty in residence.", "title": "Chinese University of Hong Kong"}
