{"summary": "Political views and ideas which are far from the mainstream are called extremist.", "full_text": "Extremism means, literally: driving  to the limit, to the extreme or the quality or state of being extreme, advocacy of extreme measures or views. \nNowadays, the term is mostly used in a political or religious sense, for an ideology that is considered  to be far outside the  mainstream attitudes of society. But extremism can, for example, also be meant in an economic sense.\nThe term \"extremism\" is usually meant to be pejorative: to express  disapproval, but it may also be meant in a more academic, purely descriptive, non-condemning sense.\nExtremists are usually contrasted with centrists or moderates. For example, in contemporary discussions in Western countries of Islam or of Islamic political movements, the distinction between extremist  and moderate  Muslims is typically stressed.\nPolitical agendas perceived as extremist often include those from the far left or far right, as well as radicalism, reactionism, fundamentalism, and fanaticism.", "title": "Extremism"}
