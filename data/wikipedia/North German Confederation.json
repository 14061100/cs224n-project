{"summary": "The North German Confederation , was a military alliance of 22 states of northern Germany.", "full_text": "The North German Confederation  was a federation of 22 previously independent states of northern Germany, with nearly 30 million inhabitants. It was the first modern German nation state and the basis for the later German Empire , when several south German states such as Bavaria joined.\nAfter several unsuccessful proposals from several sides to reform the German Confederation , the North German major power Prussia left the German Confederation with some allies. It came to war between those states on one hand and states such as Austria on the other. After a quick decision in the Austro-Prussian War of July 1866, Prussia and its allies founded the North German Federation. At first, it was a military alliance between independent states , but the states already had the intention to later form a federation or confederation with a constitution. This was realised in 1867. The North German Confederation is historically important for the economic and judicial unification of Germany; many of its laws were taken over by the German Empire.", "title": "North German Confederation"}
