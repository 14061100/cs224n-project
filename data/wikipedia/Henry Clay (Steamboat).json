{"summary": "Year 1852  was a leap year starting on Thursday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Henry Clay was an American side paddle wheel steamboat that was involved in the Hudson River's worst steam disaster, near Riverdale, in The Bronx, New York, on July 28, 1852. The Henry Clay launched in August 1851, was in service between Albany, New York and New York City in competition with other steamships and the Hudson River Railroad which had been completed along the east shore of the Hudson River to East Albany by 1851.\nOn July 28, 1852, she was sailing on the Hudson River from the river port of Albany, New York, to New York City. As she neared Riverdale, New York, a fire broke out aboard. Reports indicated that upwards of five hundred people were on board with only two lifeboats, which proved useless. Many of the victims came from prestigious families which made the disaster more newsworthy. Among the known victims was Stephen Allen, a former mayor of New York City. Congress, previously reluctant to pursue further steamboat legislation, was forced by the public to push through new regulations.", "title": "Henry Clay (Steamboat)"}
