{"summary": "In the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell published equations that describe how charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic force per unit charge.", "full_text": "In vector calculus, the divergence theorem, also known as Gauss's theorem or Ostrogradsky's theorem, is a result that relates the flow  of a vector field through a surface to the behavior of the vector field inside the surface.\nMore precisely, the divergence theorem states that the outward flux of a vector field through a closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the region inside the surface. Intuitively, it states that the sum of all sources minus the sum of all sinks gives the net flow out of a region.\nThe divergence theorem is an important result for the mathematics of engineering, in particular in electrostatics and fluid dynamics.\nIn physics and engineering, the divergence theorem is usually applied in three dimensions. However, it generalizes to any number of dimensions. In one dimension, it is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of calculus. In two dimensions, it is equivalent to Green's theorem.\nThe theorem is a special case of the more general Stokes' theorem.", "title": "Divergence theorem"}
