{"summary": "Leonhard Euler   was a Swiss mathematician and physicist.", "full_text": "Leonhard Euler   was a revolutionary Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician and engineer who made extremely important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics like infinitesimal calculus and graph theory while also inventing several branches like topology and analytic number theory. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and notation, particularly for mathematical analysis, such as the notion of a mathematical function. He is also renowned for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.\nEuler was the most eminent mathematician of the 18th century and is held to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all times. His collected works fill 60 to 80 quarto volumes, more than anybody in the field. He spent most of his adult life in St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.\nA statement attributed to Pierre-Simon Laplace expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\"", "title": "Leonhard Euler"}
