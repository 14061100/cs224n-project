The original network run of the show lasted for nearly five years to amass 1,225 episodes.\nIt continues to enjoy an intense cult following. In 2004 and 2007, Dark Shadows was ranked #19 and #23 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.\nSince 2006, the series has continued as a series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, featuring many of the original cast, including David Selby, Lara Parker, and Kathryn Leigh Scott.", "title": "Dark Shadows"}
