{"summary": "Blondie is an American new wave pop-rock band who were most popular in the 1970s and 1980s.", "full_text": "Blondie is an American rock band founded by singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein. The band was a pioneer in the early American new wave and punk scenes of the mid-late 1970s. Its first two albums contained strong elements of these genres, and although successful in the United Kingdom and Australia, Blondie was regarded as an underground band in the United States until the release of Parallel Lines in 1978. Over the next three years, the band achieved several hit singles including \"Call Me\", \"Atomic\" and \"Heart of Glass\" and became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles incorporating elements of disco, pop, rap, and reggae, while retaining a basic style as a new wave band.\nBlondie broke up after the release of its sixth studio album The Hunter in 1982. Debbie Harry continued to pursue a solo career with varied results after taking a few years off to care for partner Chris Stein, who was diagnosed with pemphigus, a rare autoimmune disease of the skin.\nThe band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and a number one single in the United Kingdom with \"Maria\" in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK No.1 single .\nThe group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Blondie has sold 40 million records worldwide and is still active today. The band's ninth studio album, Panic of Girls, was released in 2011, and their tenth, Ghosts of Download, was released in 2014.", "title": "Blondie (band)"}
