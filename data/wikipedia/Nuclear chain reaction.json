{"summary": "A nuclear reaction is a process involving an atomic nucleus or more than one nucleus.", "full_text": "A nuclear chain reaction occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent nuclear reactions, thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series of these reactions. The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes . The nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction.", "title": "Nuclear chain reaction"}
