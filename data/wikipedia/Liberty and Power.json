{"summary": "1990  was a common year starting on Monday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Liberty and Power is a group weblog established in 2003 and is part of the History News Network of the Center for History and New Media. The members share a libertarian or classical liberal perspective. They are primarily university professors and represent diverse fields. Past guest bloggers have included Nicholas Von Hoffman, a former 60 Minutes commentator. Most, but not all, of the members are critical of the Iraq war.\nLiberty and Power played an important role in shaping coverage of several news stories. For example, journalists Debra Pickett of the Chicago Sun-Times, Ellen Barry of the Los Angeles Times, and Jerry Mitchell of the Clarion-Ledger quoted David T. Beito because of his entries on the Emmett Till case. Beito had conducted the first interviews in decades with Henry Lee Loggins, an alleged participant in the crime, and Willie Reed, a trial witness.\nEntries opposing the Academic Bill of Rights sparked a running debate on Liberty and Power with David Horowitz, the chief sponsor of the bill. They were also instrumental in two articles on the subject for the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians.", "title": "Liberty and Power"}
