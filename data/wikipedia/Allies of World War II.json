{"summary": "The Allied Powers  were a group of nations that fought against the Axis countries in World War II.", "full_text": "The Allies of World War II, called the United Nations from the 1 January 1942 declaration, were the countries that together opposed the Axis powers during the Second World War . The Allies promoted the alliance as seeking to stop German, Japanese and Italian aggression.\nThe anti-German coalition at the start of the war  consisted of France, Poland and Great Britain, soon to be joined by the British Commonwealth . Poland was a minor factor after its defeat in 1939; France was a minor factor after its defeat in 1940. After first having cooperated with Germany in partitioning Poland whilst remaining neutral in the Allied-Axis conflict, the Soviet Union perforce joined the Allies in June 1941 after being invaded by Germany. The United States provided war material and money all along, and officially joined in December 1941 after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. As of 1942, the \"Big Three\" leaders of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States controlled Allied policy; relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were especially close. China had been already at war with Japan since 1937 but officially joined the Allies in 1941. The Big Three and China were referred as a \"trusteeship of the powerful\", then were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in Declaration by United Nations and later the \"Four Policemen\" of \"United Nations\" for the Allies. Other key Allies included British India, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia as well as Free France; there were numerous others. Together they called themselves the \"United Nations\" and in 1945 created the modern UN.", "title": "Allies of World War II"}
