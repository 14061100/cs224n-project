{"summary": "George Fitzgerald Smoot III  is an American professor of astrophysics and cosmology.", "full_text": "The Harvard Bridge  is a steel haunched girder bridge between Back Bay, Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, carrying Massachusetts Avenue  over the Charles River. It is the longest bridge over the Charles River at 659.82 meters . It is locally known for being measured, inaccurately, in the idiosyncratic unit of length called the smoot.\nAfter several legislative attempts fraught with antipathy on the part of Boston, it was built jointly by Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, between 1887 and 1891. It originally included a swing span. The bridge was revised over the years until its superstructure was completely replaced in the late 1980s due to unacceptable vibration and the collapse of a similar bridge. The bridge was named for the Reverend John Harvard.", "title": "Harvard Bridge"}
