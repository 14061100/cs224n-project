{"summary": "The Tabernacle was a tent used in the Book of Exodus as a temple or dwelling place of God.", "full_text": "The Tabernacle , according to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable dwelling place for the divine presence from the time of the Exodus from Egypt through the conquering of the land of Canaan. Built of gold, silver, brass, furs, jewels, and other valuable materials taken out of Egypt at God's orders and according to specifications revealed by God  to Moses at Mount Sinai, it was transported  by the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land. The First Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God some three hundred years later.\nThe fullest description of the Tabernacle describes an inner shrine  housing the Ark of the Covenant which is under the veil of the covering suspended by four pillars and an outer chamber  with beaten gold made into what is generally described as a lampstand or candlestick with six branches, each holding three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms as described in Exodus 25, standing diagonally, partially covering a table for showbread, and altar of incense. This description is generally identified as part of the Priestly source , written in the 6th or 5th century BCE. Many scholars contend that it is of a far later date than Moses, and that the description reflects the structure of the Temple of Solomon, while some hold that the description derives from memories of a real pre-monarchic shrine, perhaps the sanctuary at Shiloh. Traditional scholars contend that it describes an actual tabernacle used in the time of Moses and thereafter. According to historical criticism an earlier, pre-exilic source  describes the Tabernacle as a simple tent-sanctuary.", "title": "Tabernacle"}
