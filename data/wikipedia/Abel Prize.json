{"summary": "Mathematics, sometimes shortened to maths  or math  is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns.", "full_text": "The Abel Prize  is an international prize awarded annually by the Government of Norway to one or more outstanding mathematicians.\nNamed after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel , the award was established in 2001 by the Government of Norway and complements its sister prize in the humanities, the Holberg Prize.\nAlong with the Fields Medal, the Abel Prize has often been described as the mathematician's \"Nobel Prize\". It comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner  .\nThe prize board has also established an Abel symposium, administered by the Norwegian Mathematical Society. The award ceremony takes place in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, where the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded between 1947 and 1989.\nThe establishment of the Abel Prize was first proposed by Sophus Lie  in 1899 when he learned that Alfred Nobel's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. Lie's death marked an interruption in the establishment of the award, and King Oscar II's attempt to establish the award in 1902 was unsuccessful, complicated by the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway three years later.", "title": "Abel prize"}
