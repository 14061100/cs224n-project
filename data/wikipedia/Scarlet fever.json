{"summary": "Scarlet fever is an infectious disease that is caused by bacteria.", "full_text": "Scarlet fever, also called scarlatina in older literature, is an infectious disease which most commonly affects children. Signs and symptoms include sore throat, fever, and a characteristic red rash.\nScarlet fever is usually spread by inhalation. No vaccine is known, but the disease is effectively treated with antibiotics. Most of the clinical features are caused by erythrogenic toxin, a substance produced by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes  when it is infected by a certain bacteriophage.\nBefore the availability of antibiotics, scarlet fever was a major cause of death across the globe. It also sometimes caused late complications, such as glomerulo-nephritis and endocarditis leading to heart valve disease, all of which were protracted and often fatal afflictions at the time.\nStrains of group A streptococci that produce the erythrogenic toxin are not inherently more dangerous than other strains that do not; they are merely more easily diagnosed because of the characteristic rash.", "title": "Scarlet fever"}
