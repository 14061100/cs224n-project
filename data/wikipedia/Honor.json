{"summary": "Honour, spelt honor in the United States, is the idea of the trustworthiness and social status of a person by the society, by judgement of his actions.", "full_text": "Honour  is an abstract concept entailing a perceived quality of worthiness and respectability that affects both the social standing and the self-evaluation of an individual or corporate body such as a family, school, regiment or nation. Accordingly, individuals  are assigned worth and stature based on the harmony of their actions with a specific code of honour, and the moral code of the society at large.\nDr Samuel Johnson, in his A Dictionary of the English Language , defined honour as having several senses, the first of which was \"nobility of soul, magnanimity, and a scorn of meanness.\" This sort of honour derives from the perceived virtuous conduct and personal integrity of the person endowed with it. On the other hand, Johnson also defined honour in relationship to \"reputation\" and \"fame\"; to \"privileges of rank or birth\", and as \"respect\" of the kind which \"places an individual socially and determines his right to precedence.\" This sort of honour is not so much a function of moral or ethical excellence, as it is a consequence of power. Finally, with respect to sexuality, honour has traditionally been associated with  \"chastity\" or \"virginity\", or in case of married men and women, \"fidelity\". Some have argued that honour should be seen more as a rhetoric, or set of possible actions, than as a code.", "title": "Honor"}
