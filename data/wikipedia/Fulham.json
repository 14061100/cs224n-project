Fulham was formerly the seat of the diocese of \"Fulham and Gibraltar\", and Fulham Palace served as the former official home of the Bishop of London , the grounds of which are now divided between public allotments and an elegant botanical garden.\nHaving been through many transformations in its history, today it is a green London area within very close reach of many famously extravagant places such as Chelsea and Kensington and this is reflected in the high local house prices. It was included within Savills' 2007 list of \"prime\" London areas. Two football clubs, Fulham and Chelsea, are situated within Fulham.
