{"summary": "System  is a group of related things, that work with each other.", "full_text": "A system is a set of interacting or interdependent component parts forming a complex/intricate whole.\nEvery system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning.\nFields that study the general properties of systems include systems science, systems theory, systems modeling, systems engineering, cybernetics, dynamical systems, thermodynamics, complex systems, system analysis and design and systems architecture. They investigate the abstract properties of systems' matter and organization, looking for concepts and principles that are independent of domain, substance, type, or temporal scale.\nSome systems share common characteristics, including:\nA system has structure, it contains parts  that are directly or indirectly related to each other;\nA system has behavior, it exhibits processes that fulfill its function or purpose;\nA system has interconnectivity: the parts and processes are connected by structural and/or behavioral relationships;\nA system's structure and behavior may be decomposed via subsystems and sub-processes to elementary parts and process steps;\nA system has behavior that, in relativity to its surroundings, may be categorized as both fast and strong.\nThe term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure and/or behavior. Alternatively, and usually in the context of complex social systems, the term institution is used to describe the set of rules that govern structure and/or behavior.", "title": "System"}
