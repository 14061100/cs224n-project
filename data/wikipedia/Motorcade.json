{"summary": "A motorcade  is a number of vehicles driving in the same direction on official business.", "full_text": "A motorcade, or autocade, is a procession of vehicles. The term motorcade was coined by Lyle Abbot , and is formed after cavalcade on the false notion that \"-cade\" was a suffix meaning \"procession\". In fact, there is no such suffix in either French or Latin, although -cade has now since become a productive suffix in English, leading to the alternative names carcade, autocade, and even Hoovercade . Eric Partridge called the name a \"monstrosity\", and Lancelot Hogben considered the word to be a \"counterfeit coinage\". The original suffix in cavalcade is actually \"-ade\".", "title": "Motorcade"}
