{"summary": "Progressive Judaism, sometimes called Reform Judaism is a movement within Judaism.", "full_text": "Reform Judaism, also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism, is a major confessional division within Judaism, which emphasizes the evolving nature of the religion, the superiority of its ethical aspects compared to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a progressive revelation not centered on the theophany on Mount Sinai. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principals were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates.\n\"Reform Judaism\" as a proper term specifically refers to two denominations, the American Union for Reform Judaism and the British Movement for Reform Judaism. Along with other movements sharing the same basic convictions, such as Liberal Judaism, they are members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, founded in 1926; Reconstructionist Judaism, espousing an unrelated doctrine, entered the Union in 1990.", "title": "Reform Judaism"}
