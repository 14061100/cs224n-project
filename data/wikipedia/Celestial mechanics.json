{"summary": "In astronomy, an epoch  is a moment in time for which the position or the orbital elements of a celestial body are specified.", "full_text": "Celestial mechanics is the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of celestial objects. Historically, celestial mechanics applies principles of physics  to astronomical objects, such as stars and planets, to produce ephemeris data. As an astronomical field of study, celestial mechanics includes the sub-fields of Orbital mechanics , which deals with the orbit of an artificial satellite; and Lunar theory, which deals with the orbit of the Moon.", "title": "Celestial mechanics"}
