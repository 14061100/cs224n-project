{"summary": "Guglielmo Marconi 25 April 1874-20 July 1937 was an Italian inventor, known for being a major part of inventing long distance radio communication and for his development of Marconi's law and a radio telegraph system.", "full_text": "Marconi's law is the relation between height of antennas and maximum signaling distance of radio transmissions. Guglielmo Marconi enunciated at one time an empirical law that, for simple vertical sending and receiving antennas of equal height, the maximum working telegraphic distance varied as the square of the height of the antenna. It has been stated that the rule was tested in experiments made on Salisbury Plain in 1897, and also by experiments made by Italian naval officers on behalf of the Royal Italian Navy in 1900 and 1901. Captain Quintino Bonomo gave a report of these experiments in an official report.\n\n", "title": "Marconi's law"}
