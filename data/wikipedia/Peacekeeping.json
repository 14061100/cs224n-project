Such assistance may come in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers  can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel.\nThe United Nations is not the only organization to implement peacekeeping missions. Non-UN peacekeeping forces include the NATO mission in Kosovo  and the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula or the ones organized by the EU like EUFOR RCA . The Nonviolent Peaceforce is one NGO widely considered to have expertise in general peacemaking by non-governmental volunteers or activists.\n^ \"United Nations Peacekeeping\".
