After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and embarked on war with France in the ongoing Hundred Years' War  between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt  and saw him come close to conquering France. After months of negotiation with Charles VI of France, the Treaty of Troyes  recognized Henry V as regent and heir-apparent to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, Catherine of Valois . Following Henry V's sudden and unexpected death in France two years later, he was succeeded by his infant son, who reigned as Henry VI .", "title": "Henry V of England"}
