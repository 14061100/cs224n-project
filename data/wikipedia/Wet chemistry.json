{"summary": "Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase.", "full_text": "Wet chemistry is a form of analytical chemistry that uses classical methods such as observation to analyze materials. It is called wet chemistry since most analyzing is done in the liquid phase. Wet chemistry is also called bench chemistry since many tests are performed at lab benches. Wet chemistry is now rarely done manually except for demonstration purposes. This is due to technological advancements in the field of chemistry.", "title": "Wet chemistry"}
