His name is the source of the term \"maverick,\" first cited in 1867, which means \"independently minded.\" Various accounts of the origins of the term held that Maverick came to be considered independently minded by his fellow ranchers because he refused to brand his cattle.

Unbranded cattle which were not part of the herd came to be labelled \"mavericks\". He is the grandfather of U.S. Congressman Maury Maverick, who coined the term gobbledygook .", "title": "Samuel Maverick"}
