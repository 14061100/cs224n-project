{"summary": "An electron shell is the outside part of an atom around the atomic nucleus.", "full_text": "In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell, or a principal energy level, may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"1 shell\" , followed by the \"2 shell\" , then the \"3 shell\" , and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond with the principal quantum numbers  or are labeled alphabetically with letters used in the X-ray notation .\nEach shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight  electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18  and so on. The general formula is that the nth shell can in principle hold up to 2 electrons. Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, this is not a strict requirement: atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells.  For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration.\nThe electrons in the outermost occupied shell  determine the chemical properties of the atom; it is called the valence shell.\nEach shell consists of one or more subshells, and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals.", "title": "Electron shell"}
