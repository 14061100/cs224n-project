{"summary": "Time zones give specific areas on the Earth a time of day that is earlier or later than the neighboring time zones.", "full_text": "A time zone is a region that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial, and social purposes. Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time.\nMost of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time  by a whole number of hours , but a few are offset by 30 or 45 minutes . Some higher latitude countries use daylight saving time for part of the year, typically by changing clocks by an hour. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding nautical time zones. This also creates a permanent daylight saving time effect.", "title": "Time zone"}
