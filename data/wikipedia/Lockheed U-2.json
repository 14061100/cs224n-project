It provides day and night, very high-altitude , all-weather intelligence gathering. The U-2 has also been used for electronic sensor research, satellite calibration, and communications purposes.\nEarly versions of the U-2 were involved in several events through the Cold War, being flown over the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and Cuba. In 1960, Gary Powers was shot down in a CIA U-2A over the Soviet Union by a surface-to-air missile. Another U-2, piloted by Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., was lost in a similar fashion in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\nThe U-2 is one of a handful of aircraft types to have served the USAF for over 50 years. The newest models  entered service in the 1980s. The current model, the U-2S, received its most recent technical upgrade in 2012. They have taken part in post-Cold War conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and supported several multinational NATO operations.", "title": "Lockheed U-2"}
