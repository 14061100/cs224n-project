{"summary": "John Enoch Powell, MBE  was a British politician in the Conservative Party.", "full_text": "John Enoch Powell, MBE  was a British politician, classical scholar, linguist, and poet. He served as a Conservative Member of Parliament , Ulster Unionist Party  MP , and Minister of Health . He attained most prominence in 1968, when he made a controversial speech on immigration, now widely referred to as the Rivers of Blood speech. In response, he was dismissed from his position as Shadow Defence Secretary  in the Shadow Cabinet of Edward Heath.\nA poll at the time suggested that 74% of the UK population agreed with Powell's opinions and his supporters claim that this large public following which Powell attracted helped the Conservatives to win the 1970 general election, and perhaps cost them the February 1974 general election, when Powell turned his back on the Conservatives by endorsing a vote for Labour, who returned as a minority government in early March following a hung parliament. He returned to the House of Commons in October 1974 as the Ulster Unionist Party MP for the Northern Irish constituency of South Down until he was defeated in the 1987 general election.\nBefore entering politics, he had been a classical scholar, becoming a full professor of ancient Greek at the age of 25. During the Second World War, he served in both staff and intelligence positions, reaching the rank of brigadier in his early thirties. He also wrote poetry, his first works being published in 1937, as well as many books on classical and political subjects.", "title": "Enoch Powell"}
