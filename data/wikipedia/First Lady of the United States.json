{"summary": "The First Lady of the United States is the wife of the President of the United States.", "full_text": "The First Lady of the United States  is an unofficial title and position traditionally held by the wife of the president, concurrent with his term of office. Historically, if a president is not married, or if the president's wife is unable to act as First Lady, the president usually asks a female relative or friend to act as White House hostess. The current First Lady is Michelle Obama who, as a result of the re-election of her husband Barack Obama on November 6, 2012, is scheduled to serve until January 20, 2017.\nThe position of the First Lady is unofficial and carries no official duties. Nonetheless, first ladies have traditionally held this highly visible position in U.S. government. The role of the First Lady has evolved over the centuries. She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House. She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president.", "title": "First Lady of the United States"}
