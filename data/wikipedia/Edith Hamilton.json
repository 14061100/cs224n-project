{"summary": "1963  was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar.", "full_text": "Edith Hamilton  was an American educator and author who was \"recognized as the greatest woman Classicist\". She was sixty-two years old when The Greek Way, her first book, was published in 1930. It was instantly successful, and is the earliest expression of her belief in \"the calm lucidity of the Greek mind\" and \"that the great thinkers of Athens were unsurpassed in their mastery of truth and enlightenment\".\nIn 1957, when the Book-of-the-Month Club selected The Greek Way  as a featured book, it enhanced her efforts at directing the American mind towards Ancient Greece, despite it having been published twenty-seven years earlier. Moreover, by then, she already had published other books, among them The Roman Way , Mythology , and The Echo of Greece ; to date, at the high school and university levels, Mythology remains the premier introductory text about its subject. The New York Times has described her as the Classical Scholar who \"brought into clear and brilliant focus the Golden Age of Greek life and thought ... with Homeric power and simplicity in her style of writing\".\n^ US Census 1930\n^", "title": "Edith Hamilton"}
