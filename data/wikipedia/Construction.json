{"summary": "Construction is the process of erection or assembly of any building or infrastructure on a site.", "full_text": "Construction is the process of creating and building infrastructure or a facility. It differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction is typically done on location for a known client. Construction as an industry is six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.\nLarge scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. A Project manager normally manages the job, and a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect supervises it. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential. Those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider the zoning requirements, the environmental impact of the job, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction site safety, availability and transportation of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc.\n^ \"Construction\", Merriam-Webster.com , retrieved May 16, 2015 \n^ Halpin, Daniel W.; Senior, Bolivar A. , Construction Management , Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, p. 9, ISBN 9780470447239, retrieved May 16, 2015 \n^ Chitkara, K.
