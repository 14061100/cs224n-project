{"summary": "The National Health Service is a government run health care organization that provides health and medical services to citizens and residents of the United Kingdom.", "full_text": "Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has a publicly funded health care referred to as the National Health Service  though only the NHS in England uses this name officially. The terms National Health Service or NHS are also used to refer to the four systems collectively.\nThe systems are primarily funded through central taxation and each provides a comprehensive range of health services, the vast majority of which are free at the point of use for people legally resident in the United Kingdom. Each system operates independently and is accountable to its own political authority. However, some functions might be routinely performed on behalf of the UK Department of Health or for one of the other three systems. For example, Northern Ireland has no high security mental hospitals and thus depends on using hospitals in Great Britain, routinely Carstairs State Mental Hospital in Scotland for male patients and Rampton Secure Hospital in England for female patients.", "title": "National Health Service"}
