{"summary": "A scientific model is a simplified abstract view of a complex reality.", "full_text": "Ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the principles which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or \"ecosystem laws\"  are considered formally analogous to the principles of energetics.", "title": "Models of nature"}
