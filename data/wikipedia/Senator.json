{"summary": "In a modern democracy, a senate is a group of people who are part of a legislature.", "full_text": "A Senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature or parliament. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate , so-called as an assembly of the senior  and therefore allegedly wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.\nThus, the literal meaning of the word \"senate\" is: Assembly of Elders.\nMany countries have an assembly named a senate, composed of senators who may be elected, appointed, have inherited the title, or gained membership by other methods, depending on the country. Modern senates typically serve to provide a chamber of \"sober second thought\" to consider legislation passed by a lower house, whose members are usually elected.", "title": "Senator"}
