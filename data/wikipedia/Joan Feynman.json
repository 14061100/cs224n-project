{"summary": "Joan Feynman  is an American astrophysicist.", "full_text": "Joan Feynman  is an American astrophysicist. She has made important contributions to the study of solar wind particles and fields; sun-Earth relations; and magnetospheric physics. In particular, Feynman is known for developing an understanding of the origin of auroras. She is also known for creating a model that predicts the number of high-energy particles likely to hit a spacecraft over its lifetime, and for uncovering a method for predicting sun spot cycles. Feynman is the younger sister of physicist Richard Feynman.\n^ \"1940 United States Federal Census - Joan Feynman\". Retrieved 1 April 2013. \n^ Hirshberg, Charles . \"My Mother, the Scientist\".
