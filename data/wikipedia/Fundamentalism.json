{"summary": "Fundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century.", "full_text": "The term Fundamentalism  usually has a religious connotation indicating unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs, but fundamentalism has come to be applied to a broad tendency among certain groups, mainly, although not exclusively, in religion. This tendency is most often characterized by a markedly strict literalism as applied to certain specific scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, and a strong sense of the importance of maintaining ingroup and outgroup distinctions, leading to an emphasis on purity and the desire to return to a previous ideal from which it is believed that members have begun to stray. Rejection of diversity of opinion as applied to these established \"fundamentals\" and their accepted interpretation within the group is often the result of this tendency.\nDepending upon the context, Fundamentalism can be used as a pejorative rather than neutral characterization, similar to the ways in which referencing political perspectives as \"right-wing\" or \"left-wing\" can, for some, have negative connotations.", "title": "Fundamentalism"}
