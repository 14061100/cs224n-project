{"summary": "The National Assembly for Wales  is a devolved assembly with the power to make laws in Wales.", "full_text": "The National Assembly for Wales  is a devolved assembly with power to make legislation in Wales. It is commonly also known as the Welsh Assembly. The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs . Members are elected for four-year terms under an additional members system, where 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation.\nThe Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved.", "title": "National Assembly for Wales"}
