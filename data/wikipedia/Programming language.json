{"summary": "A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do.", "full_text": "A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.\nThe earliest programming languages preceded the invention of the digital computer and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms and player pianos. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, and many more still are being created every year. Many programming languages require computation to be specified in an imperative form , while other languages use other forms of program specification such as the declarative form .\nThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax  and semantics . Some languages are defined by a specification document , while other languages  have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference.\n^ Ettinger, James  Jacquard's Web, Oxford University Press", "title": "Programming language"}
