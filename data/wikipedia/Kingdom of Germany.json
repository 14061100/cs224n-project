{"summary": "Eastern Francia  was the land of Louis the German after the Treaty of Verdun of 843. That treaty divided Carolingian Empire of the Franks into an East, West, and Middle.", "full_text": "The Kingdom of Germany or German Kingdom  developed out of the eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire. Like Anglo-Saxon England and medieval France, it began as \"a conglomerate, an assemblage of a number of once separate and independent... gentes  and regna .\" East Francia  was formed in embryo by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and was ruled by the Carolingian dynasty until 911, after which the kingship was elective. The initial electors were the rulers of the stem duchies, who generally chose one of their own. After 962, when Otto I was crowned emperor, the kingdom formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire, which also included Italy , Bohemia  and Burgundy .\nThe term rex teutonicorum  first came into use in the chancery of Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy , perhaps as a polemical tool against the Emperor Henry IV. In the twelfth century, in order to stress the imperial and transnational character of their office, the emperors began to employ the title rex Romanorum  on their election . Distinct titulature for Germany, Italy and Burgundy, which traditionally had their own courts, laws, and chanceries, gradually dropped from use. After the Reichsreform and Reformation settlement, the German part of the Holy Roman Empire was divided into Reichskreise , which effectively defined Germany against imperial Italy and the Bohemian Kingdom. There are nevertheless relatively few references to a German realm and an instability in the term's use.", "title": "Kingdom of Germany"}
