{"summary": "A central processing unit  is an important part of almost every computer.", "full_text": "A central processing unit  is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output  operations specified by the instructions. The term has been used in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term \"CPU\" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit , distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.\nThe form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit  that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that fetches instructions from memory and \"executes\" them by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.\nMost modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a single integrated circuit  chip. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip . Some computers employ a multi-core processor, which is a single chip containing two or more CPUs called \"cores\"; in that context, single chips are sometimes referred to as \"sockets\". Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered central.\n\n", "title": "Central processing unit"}
