{"summary": "Nidwalden is a canton of Switzerland.", "full_text": "The Council of States  is the smaller chamber of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, and is considered the Assembly's upper house. There are 46 Councillors.\nTwenty of the country's cantons are represented by two Councillors each. Six cantons, traditionally called \"half cantons\", are represented by one Councillor each for historical reasons. These are Obwalden, Nidwalden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden.\nThe Councillors serve for four years, and are not bound in their vote to instructions from the Cantonal authorities. Under the Swiss Federal Constitution, the mode of election is left to the cantons, the proviso being that it must be a democratic method. However, all cantons now provide for the councillors to be chosen by popular election. In all cantons except for Zug and Appenzell Innerrhoden, the Councillors are elected concurrently with the members of the National Council. In the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden the representatives are elected by the physically convened popular assembly . With the exception of the Canton of Jura, where a proportional representation election system is used, the representatives are elected by majority vote.\nAs of 2008, there are 10 women in the Council of States, representing 22% of its membership.\n\n", "title": "Swiss Council of States"}
