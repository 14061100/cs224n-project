{"summary": "Prince Edward Island  is a province in Canada.", "full_text": "Prince Edward Island  is a province of Canada consisting of the island of the same name, as well as several much smaller islands.\nIt is one of the three Maritime Provinces and is the smallest province in both land area and population. It is the only province of Canada to have no land boundary. The island has several informal names: \"Garden of the Gulf,\" referring to the pastoral scenery and lush agricultural lands throughout the province; and \"Birthplace of Confederation\" or \"Cradle of Confederation\", referring to the Charlottetown Conference in 1864, although PEI did not join Confederation until 1873, when it became the seventh Canadian province. The backbone of the economy is farming, as it produces 25% of Canada's potatoes. Historically, PEI is one of Canada's older settlements and demographically still reflects older immigration to the country, with Celtic, Anglo Saxon and French last names being overwhelmingly dominant to this day.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the province of Prince Edward Island has 140,204 residents. It is located about 200 km north of Halifax, Nova Scotia and 600 km east of Quebec City. It consists of the main island and 231 minor islands. Altogether, the entire province has a land area of 5,685.73 km2 .\nThe main island is 5,620 km2  in size, which is slightly larger than the U.S. state of Delaware, is the 104th-largest island in the world, and is Canada's 23rd-largest island.", "title": "Prince Edward Island"}
