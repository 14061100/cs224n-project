{"summary": "Symptoms are changes in the human body.", "full_text": "A symptom  is a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient, reflecting the presence of an unusual state, or of a disease. A symptom is subjective, observed by the patient, and cannot be measured directly, whereas a sign is objectively observable by others. For example, paresthesia is a symptom , whereas erythema is a sign . Symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain diagnoses, helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being pathognomonic.\nThe term is sometimes also applied to physiological states outside the context of disease, as for example when referring to \"symptoms of pregnancy\".", "title": "Symptom"}
