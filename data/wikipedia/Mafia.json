{"summary": "The Mafia is a crime group working in many parts of the world that was created in Italy more than 200 years ago.", "full_text": "A mafia is a type of organized crime syndicate whose primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as gambling, drug-trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud.\nThe term was originally applied to the Sicilian Mafia, but has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, e.g., \"the Russian Mafia\" or \"the Japanese Mafia\". The term is applied informally by the press and public; the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms - e.g., the original Sicilian and Italian-American Mafia call themselves \"Cosa Nostra\" and the \"Japanese Mafia\" calls itself yakuza.\nWhen used alone and without any qualifier, \"Mafia\" or \"the Mafia\" typically refers to either the Sicilian Mafia or the Italian-American Mafia, and sometimes Italian organized crime in general.", "title": "Mafia"}
