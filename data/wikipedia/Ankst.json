After a handful of low key cassette releases, the label relocated to Cardiff and became a more serious concern, providing a launch-pad for several popular Welsh artists, including Llwybr Llaethog, Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. The Rough Guide to Wales described Ankst as \"one of the most prolific, eclectic and innovative\" of the 1990s Welsh music labels.\nBetween 1988 and 1997, the label put out some 80 releases before splitting in 1997 into two separate companies. Ankst Management  and Ankstmusik, the label , featuring such bands as Tystion, Ectogram, Zabrinski, Rheinallt H Rowlands, MC Mabon and Wendykurk.\nAnkst moved into film making in the 2000s, releasing the Bafta-winning Y Lleill in 2005.\nAlun Llwyd also co-manages, with Kevin Tame, the Cardiff-based indie label Turnstile, home of Perfume Genius, Christopher Owens, Gruff Rhys, Cate Le Bon and others.\n^ a b c Adams, Owen . \"Label of love: Ankst\".
