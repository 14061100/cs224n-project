{"summary": "The Branch Davidians  are a religious group that split in 1955 from the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists , The movement is also known as \"The Branch\".", "full_text": "The Branch Davidians  are a religious group that originated in 1955 from a schism in the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists , a reform movement that began as an offshoot from the Seventh-day Adventist Church  around 1930. Some of those who accepted the reform message had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of their supplemental teachings.\nFrom its inception in 1930, the reform movement believed themselves to be living in a time when Bible prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's Second Coming. The name \"Branch Davidian\" is most widely known for the Waco siege of 1993 on their property  near Waco, Texas. The 51-day siege, by the ATF, FBI, and Texas National Guard, resulted in the deaths of the Branch Davidians' leader, David Koresh, as well as 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children, and four ATF agents.\nToday, the original Davidian Seventh-day Adventists and the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists are two different and distinct groups. The doctrinal beliefs differ on such teachings as the Holy Spirit and its nature, the feast days and requirements, and who had the prophetic office since Victor Houteff's death.", "title": "Branch Davidian"}
