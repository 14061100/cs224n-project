The images may be individual still photographs or sequences of images constituting videos or movies. The word camera comes from camera obscura, which means \"dark chamber\" and is the Latin name of the original device for projecting an image of external reality onto a flat surface. The modern photographic camera evolved from the camera obscura. The functioning of the camera is very similar to the functioning of the human eye.", "title": "Camera"}
