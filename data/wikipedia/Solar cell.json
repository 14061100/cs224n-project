{"summary": "A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy.", "full_text": "See also Photovoltaics\n\nA solar cell, or photovoltaic cell, is an electrical device that converts the energy of light directly into electricity by the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon. It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as current, voltage, or resistance, vary when exposed to light. Solar cells are the building blocks of photovoltaic modules, otherwise known as solar panels.\nSolar cells are described as being photovoltaic irrespective of whether the source is sunlight or an artificial light. They are used as a photodetector , detecting light or other electromagnetic radiation near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\nThe operation of a photovoltaic  cell requires 3 basic attributes:\nThe absorption of light, generating either electron-hole pairs or excitons.\nThe separation of charge carriers of opposite types.\nThe separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\nIn contrast, a solar thermal collector supplies heat by absorbing sunlight, for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect electrical power generation from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" , on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell , or to a device that splits water directly into hydrogen and oxygen using only solar illumination.", "title": "Solar cell"}
