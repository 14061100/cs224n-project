{"summary": "Max Born  was a German physicist and mathematician who was important in the development of quantum mechanics.", "full_text": "Walter Maurice Elsasser  was a German-born American physicist considered a \"father\" of the presently accepted dynamo theory as an explanation of the Earth's magnetism. He proposed that this magnetic field resulted from electric currents induced in the fluid outer core of the Earth. He revealed the history of the Earth's magnetic field through pioneering the study of the magnetic orientation of minerals in rocks.\nThe Olin Hall at the Johns Hopkins University has a Walter Elsasser Memorial in the lobby.", "title": "Walter Elsasser"}
