{"summary": "The New Age , also called the New Age movement is a kind of spiritual belief and way of life held by some westerners.", "full_text": "Religious pluralism is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:\nAs the name of the worldview according to which one's religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions.\nAs acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid. This may be considered a form of either toleration  or moral relativism.\nThe understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. This is called Perennialism  or Traditionalism.\nSometimes as a synonym for ecumenism, i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different denominations within a single religion.\nAs term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations.\nAs a social norm and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.", "title": "Religious pluralism"}
