{"summary": "An ion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms.", "full_text": "An ion  is an atom or a molecule in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge.\nIons can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization. In chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a net positive charge and is known as a cation. If an atom gains electrons, it has a net negative charge and is known as an anion. An ion consisting of a single atom is an atomic or monatomic ion; if it consists of two or more atoms, it is a molecular or polyatomic ion. Because of their electric charges, cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic compounds, such as salts.\nIn the case of physical ionization of a medium, such as a gas, what are known as \"ion pairs\" are created by ion impact, and each pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion.\n^ \"Ion\" entry in Collins English Dictionary, HarperCollins Publishers, 1998.\n^", "title": "Ion"}
