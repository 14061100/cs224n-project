{"summary": "Professional wrestling, pro wrestling or simply wrestling is a kind of sport.", "full_text": "Professional wrestling  is an athletic form of entertainment based on a fictionized, highly exaggerated portrayal of a combat sport. Taking the form of live events held by touring promotions, it portrays a unique style of combat based on a combination of adopted styles, which include classical wrestling, catch wrestling and various forms of martial arts, as well as an innovative style based on grappling , striking and aerialism. An additional aspect of weaponry is used to varying degrees.\nThe content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are executed in special manners designed to both protect from, yet simulate pain. These facts were once kept highly secret but are now openly declared as the truth. By and large, the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media  will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle.\nAlthough the combative content is staged and communicated between the wrestlers, there are legitimate physical hazards resulting in serious injury and death in limited cases, as the production of the content is highly realistic.\n^ Barthes, Roland . \"The World Of Wrestling\".
