{"summary": "Harold Clayton Lloyd, Sr.", "full_text": "Harold Clayton Lloyd, Sr.  was an American actor, comedian, film director, film producer, screenwriter, and stunt performer who is most famous for his silent comedy films.\nHarold Lloyd ranks alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as one of the most popular and influential film comedians of the silent film era. Lloyd made nearly 200 comedy films, both silent and \"talkies\", between 1914 and 1947. He is best known for his bespectacled \"Glasses\" character, a resourceful, success-seeking go-getter who was perfectly in tune with 1920s-era United States.\nHis films frequently contained \"thrill sequences\" of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, for which he is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street in Safety Last!  is one of the most enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd did many of these dangerous stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand .\nAlthough Lloyd's individual films were not as commercially successful as Chaplin's on average, he was far more prolific , and made more money overall .", "title": "Harold Lloyd"}
