{"summary": "Electrical conductivity is the measure of a material's ability to accommodate the transport of an electric charge.", "full_text": "In electromagnetism, current density is the electric current per unit area of cross section. It is defined as a vector whose magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area at a given point in space . In SI units, the electric current density is measured in amperes per square metre.", "title": "Current density"}
