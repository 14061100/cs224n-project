Simone became fully convinced her rejection had been entirely due to her race. Soon after Simone moved to New York City where she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music.. To fund her musical education and become a classical pianist, she began playing at a small club in Atlantic City.\nSimone recorded more than forty albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974, and had a hit in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\".\nHer musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.", "title": "Nina Simone"}
