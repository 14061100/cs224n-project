{"summary": "The transition metals are a group of metals that are found in the middle of the periodic table.", "full_text": "In chemistry, the term transition metal  has two possible meanings:\nThe IUPAC definition defines a transition metal as \"an element whose atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell\".\nMost scientists describe a \"transition metal\" as any element in the d-block of the periodic table, which includes groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and actinide series are also considered transition metals and are called \"inner transition metals\".\nEnglish chemist Charles Bury first used the word transition in 1921 when he referred to a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons  from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32. These elements are now known as the d-block.", "title": "Transition metal"}
