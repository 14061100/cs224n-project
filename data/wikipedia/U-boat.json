{"summary": "An U-boat was a type of military submarine used by Germany.", "full_text": "U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \"undersea boat\". While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one  refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role , enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the islands of the United Kingdom and  to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean.\nAustro-Hungarian navy submarines were also known as U-boats.\n\n", "title": "U-boat"}
