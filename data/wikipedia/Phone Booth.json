In the USA and in some parts of Canada, \"telephone booth\"  is the commonly used term for the structure, while in the Commonwealth of Nations  it is a \"telephone box\" .\nSuch a booth usually has lighting, a door to provide privacy, and windows to let others know if the booth is in use. The booth may be furnished with a printed directory of local telephone numbers, and a booth in a formal setting, such as a hotel, may be furnished with paper and pen and even a seat. An outdoor booth may be made of metal and plastic to withstand the elements and heavy use, while an indoor booth  may have more elaborate architecture and furnishings. Most outdoor booths feature the name and logo of the telephone service provider.\n^ The Plight of the Dartmoor Telephone Boxes\n^ Discussion Note on Phone Boxes, Kiosks and ATM machines at Urban Design London\n^ Sag, Ivan; Baldwin, Timothy; Bond, Francis; Copestake, Ann; Flickinger, Dan. \"Multiword Expressions: A Pain in the Neck for NLP\" .
