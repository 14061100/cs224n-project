{"summary": "The Chancellor of Germany  is the leader of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.", "full_text": "The Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  is, under the German 1949 constitution, the head of government of Germany. It is historically a continuation of the office of Chancellor  that was originally established as the office of Chancellor of the North German Confederation in 1867. The 1949 constitution increased the role of the Chancellor compared to the 1919 Weimar Constitution by making the Chancellor much more independent of the influence of the Federal President and granting the Chancellor the right to set the guidelines for all policy areas, thus making him the real chief executive. The role is generally comparable to that of Prime Minister in other parliamentary democracies.\nThere have been eight chancellors since 1949. The current Chancellor of Germany is Angela Merkel, who was elected in 2005. She is the first female Chancellor since the establishment of the original office in 1867, and known in German as Bundeskanzlerin, the feminine form of Bundeskanzler. Merkel is also the first Chancellor elected since the fall of the Berlin Wall to have been raised in the former East Germany.", "title": "Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)"}
