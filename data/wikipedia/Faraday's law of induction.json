It is one of the basic laws of electromagnetism.", "full_text": "Electromagnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force across a conductor exposed to time varying magnetic fields. Michael Faraday, who mathematically described Faraday's law of induction, is generally credited with its discovery in 1831.", "title": "Faraday's law of induction"}
