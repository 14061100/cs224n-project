{"summary": "The criticism of Buddhism is much like the criticism of any other religion.", "full_text": "Criticism of Buddhism, much like the criticism of religion in general, can be found from those who disagree with or question the assertions, beliefs or other factors of various schools of Buddhism. Some Buddhist denominations, many predominantly Buddhist nations, and individual Buddhist leaders have been criticized in one way or another. Sources of criticism can come from, for example, agnostics, skeptics, \"anti-religion\" philosophers, rationalists, proponents of other religions, or by Buddhists espousing reform or simply expressing their dislike.\nThere are two criteria of criticism of any system of thoughts; one is based on rational evaluation of its doctrines, texts, teachings and practice, and the other criterion pertains to the consistency or inconsistency of the practitioners in applying the teachings.", "title": "Criticism of Buddhism"}
