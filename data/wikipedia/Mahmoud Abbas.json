Abbas is a member of the Fatah party.\nMahmoud Abbas was elected to serve until 9 January 2009 but, due to Palestinian internal conflict, he unilaterally extended his term for another year and continued in office, even half a decade after that second deadline expired. As a result, Fatah's main rival, Hamas announced that it would not recognise the extension or view Abbas as rightful president. Abbas was chosen as the President of the Palestinian Authority by the Palestine Liberation Organization's Central Council on 23 November 2008, a job he had held unofficially since 8 May 2005.\nAbbas served as the first Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority from March to September 2003.
