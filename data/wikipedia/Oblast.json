{"summary": "Oblast is a type of administrative division in Slavic countries and some countries of the former Soviet Union.", "full_text": "An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The term is analogous to \"state\" or \"province\".\nOfficial terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ, but some still use a cognate of the Russian term, e.g. voblast  is used for provinces of Belarus, and oblys  for Regions of Kazakhstan.\nThe word \"oblast\" is a loanword in English, but it is nevertheless often translated as \"area\", \"zone\", \"province\", or \"region\". The last translation may lead to confusion, because \"raion\" may be used for other kinds of administrative subdivision, which may be translated as \"region\" or \"district\", depending on the context.\n\n", "title": "Oblast"}
