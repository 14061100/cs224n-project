{"summary": "Special relativity  is a theory in physics that was developed and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 because of some weaknesses that had been discovered in older physics.", "full_text": "The relativistic Doppler effect is the change in frequency  of light, caused by the relative motion of the source and the observer , when taking into account effects described by the special theory of relativity.\nThe relativistic Doppler effect is different from the non-relativistic Doppler effect as the equations include the time dilation effect of special relativity and do not involve the medium of propagation as a reference point. They describe the total difference in observed frequencies and possess the required Lorentz symmetry.", "title": "Transverse doppler effect"}
