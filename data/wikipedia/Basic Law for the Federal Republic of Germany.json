{"summary": "The Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany is the name of Germany's constitution.", "full_text": "The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany  is the constitutional law of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nIt was approved on 8 May 1949 in Bonn, and, with the signature of the western Allies of World War II on 12 May, came into effect on 23 May. Its original field of application  comprised the states of the Trizone that were initially included in the then West German Federal Republic of Germany, but not West Berlin.\nThe German word Grundgesetz may be translated as either Basic Law or Fundamental Law . The term Verfassung  was not used, as the drafters regarded the Grundgesetz as temporary for the provisional West German state and that a constitution be formally enacted under the provision of Article 146 of the Basic Law for an ultimate reunified Germany.\nThe authors of the Basic Law sought to ensure that a potential dictator would never again have the chance to come into power in the country. Although some of the Basic Law is based on the Weimar republic constitution, the authors also ensured that human rights and human dignity was made the central and core part of the Basic Law. The principles of democracy, republicanism, social responsibility, and federalism are key components of the Basic Law; these principles are constitutionally entrenched, and they cannot be removed or repealed by the normal amendment process.", "title": "Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany"}
