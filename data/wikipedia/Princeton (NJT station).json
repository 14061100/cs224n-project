{"summary": "Princeton is a community in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States.", "full_text": "Princeton is the northern terminus of the Princeton Branch commuter rail service operated by New Jersey Transit , and is located on the Princeton University campus in Princeton, New Jersey. At the branch's southern end at Princeton Junction, connections are available to NJT's Northeast Corridor Line and peak-hour Amtrak trains. The shuttle train between the two stations is known as the \"Dinky\", and has also been known as the \"PJ&B\", for \"Princeton Junction and Back\". At 2.9 mi , it is the shortest scheduled commuter rail line in the United States.\nPlans to relocate Princeton Station 460 ft  south, proposed by the university and approved by NJT and the Princeton Regional Planning Board, were met with opposition from some commuters, residents, alumni, and transportation advocates. A few legal challenges were still pending as of January 2015, even after the opening of the new station. Initial studies have been conducted to build a bus transitway along the Dinky right-of-way as part of a proposed Bus Rapid Transit system.\nThe historic 1918 train station closed permanently on August 23, 2013. Approximately 1,200 ft  to the southeast, a temporary station operated from August 26, 2013 through November 9, 2014, accompanied by various bus routes shuttling among the old station, the temporary station, and Princeton Junction. The new permanent Princeton Station, designed by architect Rick Joy, opened on November 17, 2014, with construction continuing on a complex of arts and dining buildings in the surrounding area.", "title": "Princeton (NJT station)"}
