{"summary": "A duchy is a territory or domain ruled by a duke or duchess.", "full_text": "A duchy  is a country, territory, fief, or domain ruled by a duke or duchess. The term is used almost exclusively in Europe, where in present-day there is no sovereign Duchy  left.\nThe term \"Duke\"  should not be confounded with the title \"Grand Duke\" , as there exists a significant difference of rank between the two.\nIn common European cultural heritage, a Grand Duke is the third highest monarchic rank, after Emperor and King. Its synonym in many eastern European languages  is Grand Prince, whereas most western European languages  use the expression Grand Duke. Unlike a duke, the sovereign Grand Duke is considered to be part of \"Royalty\" . The correct form of address is His Royal Highness .\nIn contrast to this, the rank of a Duke differs from one country to the next. In Germany, for example, a Duke is listed in the aristocratic hierarchy below an Emperor , King , Grand Duke , Elector  and Sovereign Prince  -in that order-, whereas in Britain the Duke comes third after King/Queen and Prince .\nIn all countries existed an important difference between \"Sovereign Dukes\" and Dukes subordinate to a King or Emperor. Some historic Duchies were sovereign in areas that would become part of nation state realms only during the Modern era, such as Germany  and Italy . In contrast, others were subordinate districts of those Kingdoms that unified either partially or completely during the Medieval era, such as France, Spain, Sicily, Naples and the Papal States. In England, the term is used in respect of non-territorial entities.\n\n", "title": "Duchy"}
