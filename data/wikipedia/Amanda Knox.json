{"summary": "Amanda Marie Knox  is an American author who was imprisoned without bail bond in Italy for 4 years during the trial and acquittal of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, her British college housemate, in Perugia, Italy.", "full_text": "Amanda Marie Knox  is an American woman who spent almost four years in an Italian prison following the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher, one of the women who shared her apartment, before being definitively acquitted by the Supreme Court of Cassation. Knox, then twenty years old, had raised the alarm after returning from spending the night with her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Following an interrogation, the conduct of which is a matter of dispute, Knox implicated herself and an employer. Knox and Sollecito were initially accused of murdering Kercher while acting with the employer, but he was released and substituted for Rudy Guede whose bloodstained fingerprints had been found on Kercher's possessions.\nPre trial publicity in Italian media portrayed Knox in a negative light, leading to complaints that the prosecution was using character assassination tactics. A guilty verdict at Knox's initial trial and her 26-year sentence caused international controversy, as US experts expressed the opinion that forensic evidence at the crime scene was incompatible with her involvement. A prolonged legal process, including a successful prosecution appeal against her acquittal at a second-level trial, continued after Knox was freed in 2011 and returned to the US. On March 27, 2015 Italy's highest court definitively exonerated Knox and Sollecito. Knox's conviction for Calunnia was upheld, and she is currently being tried on a criminal defamation charge for saying police struck her during the interrogation.", "title": "Amanda Knox"}
