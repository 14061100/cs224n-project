{"summary": "Most chemical elements are stable: If they are not part of a chemical reaction, they do not change.", "full_text": "The decay energy is the energy released by a radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is the process in which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting ionizing particles and radiation. This decay, or loss of energy, results in an atom of one type, called the parent nuclide transforming to an atom of a different type, called the daughter nuclide.", "title": "Decay energy"}
