{"summary": "The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves.", "full_text": "A rifle is a firearm designed to be fired from the shoulder, with a barrel that has a helical groove or pattern of grooves  cut into the barrel walls. The raised areas of the rifling are called \"lands,\" which make contact with the projectile , imparting spin around an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile and prevents tumbling, in the same way that a properly thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-efficient pointed bullets  and thus improves range and accuracy. The word \"rifle\" originally referred to the grooving, and a rifle was called a \"rifled gun.\" Rifles are used in warfare, hunting and shooting sports.\nTypically, a bullet is propelled by the contained deflagration of an explosive compound , although other means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, hunting small game, formal target shooting and casual shooting .", "title": "Rifle"}
