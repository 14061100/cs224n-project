{"summary": "Validity is an idea that is used in everyday language and in logic.", "full_text": "In logic, an argument is valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion. A formula is valid if and only if it is true under every interpretation, and an argument form  is valid if and only if every argument of that logical form is valid.\n^ http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/\n^ Beall, Jc and Restall, Greg, \"Logical Consequence\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , Edward N.
