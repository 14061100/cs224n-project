{"summary": "Edna Mae Durbin, known as Deanna Durbin , was a Canadian actress and singer.", "full_text": "Edna Mae Durbin , known professionally as Deanna Durbin, was a Canadian-born American actress and singer, who appeared in musical films in the 1930s and 1940s. With the technical skill and vocal range of a legitimate lyric soprano, she performed everything from popular standards to operatic arias.\nDurbin made her first film appearance with Judy Garland in Every Sunday , and subsequently signed a contract with Universal Studios. Her success as the ideal teenage daughter in films such as Three Smart Girls  was credited with saving the studio from bankruptcy. In 1938, at the age of 17, Durbin was awarded the Academy Juvenile Award.\nAs she matured Durbin grew dissatisfied with the girl-next-door roles assigned to her, and attempted to portray a more womanly and sophisticated style. The film noir Christmas Holiday  and the whodunit Lady on a Train  were, however, not as well received as her musical-comedies and romances had been.\nDurbin retired from acting and singing in 1949, and withdrew from public life. She married film producer-director Charles Henri David in 1950, and the couple moved to a farmhouse near Paris.", "title": "Deanna Durbin"}
