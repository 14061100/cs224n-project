{"summary": "Aage Niels Bohr  was a Danish physicist and the fourth son of Margrethe Bohr and Niels Bohr.", "full_text": "Aage Niels Bohr  was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\". Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments. Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he is one of four pairs of fathers and sons who have won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n", "title": "Aage Niels Bohr"}
