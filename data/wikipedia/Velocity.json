{"summary": "Velocity is a measure of how fast something has moved in a particular direction.", "full_text": "The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of motion . Velocity is an important concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.\nVelocity is a physical vector quantity; both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The scalar absolute value  of velocity is called \"speed\", a quantity that is measured in metres per second  in the SI  system. For example, \"5 metres per second\" is a scalar , whereas \"5 metres per second east\" is a vector.\nIf there is a change in speed, direction, or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration.", "title": "Velocity"}
