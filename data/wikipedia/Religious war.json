{"summary": "Anabaptists are Protestant Christians of the Radical Reformation of 16th century Europe.", "full_text": "A religious war or holy war  is a war primarily caused or justified by differences in religion. The account of the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites in the Book of Joshua, the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries, and the Christian Crusades  and Wars of Religion  are the classic examples but a religious aspect has been part of warfare as early as the battles of the Mesopotamian city-states.\nIn the modern era, arguments are common over the extent to which religious, economic, or ethnic aspects of a conflict predominate: examples include the Yugoslav Wars and the civil war in Sudan. In several ongoing conflicts including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Syrian civil war, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, religious arguments are overtly present but variously described as fundamentalism or religious extremism depending upon the observer's sympathies. At the same time, members of many religions have been and are active members of the modern anti-war movement", "title": "Religious war"}
