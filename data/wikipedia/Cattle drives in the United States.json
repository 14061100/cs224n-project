{"summary": "A cattle drive is the process of moving a herd of cattle from one place to another, usually moved and herded by cowboys on horses.", "full_text": "Cattle drives were a major economic activity in the 19th-century American West, particularly between 1866 and 1886, when 20 million cattle were herded from Texas to railheads in Kansas, for shipments to stockyards in Chicago and points east. The long distances covered, the need for periodic rests by riders and animals, and the establishment of railheads led to the development of \"cow towns\" across the frontier.\nBecause of extensive treatment of cattle drives in fiction and film, the cowboy became the worldwide iconic image of the American. Cattle drives still occur in the American West.", "title": "Cattle drives in the United States"}
