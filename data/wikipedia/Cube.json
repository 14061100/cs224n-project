{"summary": "A cube is a block with all right angles and whose height, width and depth are all the same.", "full_text": "In geometry, a cube is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square faces, facets or sides, with three meeting at each vertex.\nThe cube is the only regular hexahedron and is one of the five Platonic solids and has 12 edges, 6 faces and 8 vertices.\nThe cube is also a square parallelepiped, an equilateral cuboid and a right rhombohedron. It is a regular square prism in three orientations, and a trigonal trapezohedron in four orientations.\nThe cube is dual to the octahedron. It has cubical or octahedral symmetry.", "title": "Cube"}
