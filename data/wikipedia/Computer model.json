{"summary": "A computer-based model is a computer program that is designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation.", "full_text": "A computer simulation is a simulation, run on a single computer, or a network of computers, to reproduce behavior of a system. The simulation uses an abstract model  to simulate the system. Computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics , astrophysics, climatology, chemistry and biology, human systems in economics, psychology, social science, and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system's model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.\nComputer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes to network-based groups of computers running for hours to ongoing simulations that run for days. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible  using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. Over 10 years ago, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program Other examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; a 2.64-million-atom model of the complex maker of protein in all organisms, a ribosome, in 2005; a complete simulation of the life cycle of Mycoplasma genitalium in 2012; and the Blue Brain project at EPFL , begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level.\nBecause of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification.", "title": "Computer model"}
