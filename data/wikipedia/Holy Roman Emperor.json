{"summary": "Holy Roman Emperor was the title that was given to the ruler of a loose group of places in mostly central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire.", "full_text": "The Holy Roman Emperor  was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. From an autocracy in Carolingian times the title evolved into an elected monarchy chosen by the Prince-electors. Until the Reformation the Emperor elect  was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title.\nThe title was held in conjunction with the rule of the Kingdom of Germany and the Kingdom of Italy . In theory, the Holy Roman Emperor was primus inter pares  among the other Roman Catholic monarchs; in practice, a Holy Roman Emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances made him.\nVarious royal houses of Europe, at different times, effectively became hereditary holders of the title, in particular in later times the Habsburgs. After the Reformation many of the subject states and most of those in Germany were Protestant while the Emperor continued to be Catholic. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last Emperor  as a result of the collapse of the polity during the Napoleonic wars.", "title": "Holy Roman Emperor"}
