{"summary": "The nucleus is the center of an atom.", "full_text": "Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies atomic nuclei and their constituents and interactions. The most commonly known application of nuclear physics is nuclear power generation, but the research has led to applications in many fields, including nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear weapons, ion implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology and archaeology.\nThe field of particle physics evolved out of nuclear physics and is typically taught in close association with nuclear physics.", "title": "Nucleus (physics)"}
