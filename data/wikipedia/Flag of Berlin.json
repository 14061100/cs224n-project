{"summary": "April is the fourth month of the year, and comes between March and May.", "full_text": "The flag of Berlin has three stripes of red-white-red, the two outer stripes each occupying a fifth of its height, the middle the remaining three fifths. It is defaced with a bear in the case of the civil flag, and the coat of arms of Berlin on the state flag.\nThe civil flag of West Berlin was adopted on 26 May 1954. Designed by Ottfried Neubecker, it came in second in the contest of 1952, the winner being rejected by the Senate. The emblem of the bear is apparently a pun on the city's name . The bear is placed slightly to the left.\nThe state flag replaces the bear with the full coat of arms, with escutcheon. Being the state flag for West Berlin, it became the flag of the whole city after the reunification of Germany in 1990. Previously to that, it had also been a naval ensign on the basis that neither German one could be used. It is in the proportion 3:5.\n\n", "title": "Flag of Berlin"}
