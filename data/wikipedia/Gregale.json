It also affects other islands of the Western Mediterranean.\nThe name derives from the Italian grecale, which refers to the island of Zakynthos, in Greece.\nThis is likely to be the Euroclydon storm, from Greek Euros  and kludo  or Latin Aquilo  \"northeaster\" or the island Clauda , which wrecked the apostle Paul's ship on the coast of Malta on his way to Rome .", "title": "Gregale"}
