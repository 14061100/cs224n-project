{"summary": "Anna Eleanor Roosevelt  was the longest-serving First Lady of the United States, holding the post from 1933 to 1945 during her husband President Franklin D.", "full_text": "Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt  was the second wife of James Roosevelt I , the mother of President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt, her only child, and subsequently the mother-in-law of Eleanor Roosevelt.\nDelano grew up in Newburgh, New York, and spent three years in Hong Kong. She gave birth to Franklin in 1882, and was a devoted mother to him for the remainder of her life, including home schooling and living close by in adulthood. She had a complex relationship with her daughter-in-law Eleanor, which has led to media portrayals of her as a domineering and fearsome mother-in-law, though these are at odds with other views. She died in 1941, with her son, now President, at her side.", "title": "Sara Roosevelt"}
