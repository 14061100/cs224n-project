{"summary": "The Kennedy Space Center is next to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, USA .", "full_text": "The John F. Kennedy Space Center  is one of ten National Aeronautics and Space Administration field centers and the Center of Excellence for launch and payload processing systems. Located on the east coast of Florida, KSC is adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station . The management of the two entities work very closely together, share resources, and even own facilities on each other's property.\nKSC has been NASA's primary launch center of human spaceflight since December 1968. Launch operations for the Apollo, Skylab and Space Shuttle programs were carried out from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 and managed by KSC. Though the first Apollo flights, and all Project Mercury and Project Gemini flights took off from CCAFS, the launches were managed by KSC and its previous organization, the Launch Operations Directorate. Starting with the fourth Gemini mission, the NASA launch control center in Florida  began handing off control of the vehicle to the Mission Control Center shortly after liftoff; prior missions held control throughout the entire mission.\nAdditionally, the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions, researches food production and In-Situ Resource Utilization for off Earth exploration, and more. Since 2010, the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships, even adding a new launch pad  in 2015.\nThere are about 700 facilities grouped across the center's 144,000 acres. Among the unique facilities at KSC are the 525 ft tall Vehicle Assembly Building for stacking NASA's largest rockets, Operations and Checkout Building which houses the astronaut crew quarters, and 3-mile-long Shuttle Landing Facility. There is also a Visitor Complex open to the public on site.", "title": "Kennedy Space Center"}
