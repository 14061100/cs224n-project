{"summary": "A dam is a large wall or barrier that obstructs or stops the flow of water, forming a reservoir or a lake.", "full_text": "A dam is a barrier that impounds water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for such activities as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability. Hydropower is often used in conjunction with dams to generate electricity. A dam can also be used to collect water or for storage of water which can be evenly distributed between locations. Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water, while other structures such as floodgates or levees  are used to manage or prevent water flow into specific land regions.\nThe word dam can be traced back to Middle English, and before that, from Middle Dutch, as seen in the names of many old cities.\n^ \"Bartleby.com: Great Books Online -- Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more\". bartleby.com.

However, there is one village, Obdam, that is already mentioned in 1120. The word seems to be related to the Greek word taphos, meaning \"grave\" or \"grave hill\". So the word should be understood as \"dike from dug out earth\". The names of more than 40 places  from the Middle Dutch era  such as Amsterdam  and Rotterdam, also bear testimony to the use of the word in Middle Dutch at that time.", "title": "Dam"}
