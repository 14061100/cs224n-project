{"summary": "White supremacy is the belief that white people are better than other races.", "full_text": "White supremacy or white supremacism is a form of racism centered upon the belief, and promotion of the belief, that white people are superior in certain characteristics, traits, and attributes to people of other racial backgrounds and that therefore whites should politically, economically and socially rule non-whites. The term is also typically used to describe a political ideology that perpetuates and maintains the social, political, historical and/or industrial domination by white people . Different forms of white supremacism put forth different conceptions of who is considered white, and different white supremacists identify various racial and cultural groups as their primary enemy. White supremacists have typically defined Jews, Catholics, even if white, and Native Americans as undesirable.\nIn academic usage, particularly in usage drawing on critical race theory, the term \"white supremacy\" can also refer to a political or socio-economic system where whites enjoy a structural advantage  over other ethnic groups, both at a collective and an individual level.", "title": "White supremacist"}
