{"summary": "A nuclear weapon is a weapon that suddenly releases the energy in the nucleus of certain types of atoms.", "full_text": "Ivy Mike was the codename given to the first test of a full-scale thermonuclear device, in which part of the explosive yield comes from nuclear fusion. It was detonated on November 1, 1952 by the United States on Enewetak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean, as part of Operation Ivy. The device was the first full test of the Teller-Ulam design, a staged fusion bomb, and was the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb.\nDue to its physical size and fusion fuel type , the Mike device was not suitable for use as a weapon; it was intended as an extremely conservative proof of concept experiment to validate the concepts used for multi-megaton detonations. A simplified and lightened bomb version  was prepared, and scheduled to be tested in operation Castle Yankee, as a backup in case the non-cryogenic \"Shrimp\" fusion device  failed to work; that test was cancelled when the Bravo device was tested successfully, making the cryogenic designs obsolete.", "title": "Ivy Mike"}
