{"summary": "The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies  is an independent research organization, which started in July 2006. Its office is in Kabul, Afghanistan.", "full_text": "Peace and conflict studies is a social science field that identifies and analyses violent and nonviolent behaviours as well as the structural mechanisms attending conflicts  with a view towards understanding those processes which lead to a more desirable human condition. A variation on this, peace studies , is an interdisciplinary effort aiming at the prevention, de-escalation, and solution of conflicts by peaceful means, thereby seeking \"victory\" for all parties involved in the conflict. This is in contrast to war studies , which has as its aim on the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts, primarily by violent means to the satisfaction of one or more, but not all, parties involved. Disciplines involved may include political science, geography, economics, psychology, sociology, international relations, history, anthropology, religious studies, and gender studies, as well as a variety of others. Relevant sub-disciplines of such fields, such as peace economics, may be regarded as belonging to peace and conflict studies also.", "title": "Peace studies"}
