{"summary": "Mount Redoubt, also called Redoubt Volcano, is a volcano in the U.S.", "full_text": "Redoubt Volcano, or Mount Redoubt, is an active stratovolcano in the largely volcanic Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located at the head of the Chigmit Mountains subrange in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, the mountain is just west of Cook Inlet, in the Kenai Peninsula Borough about 180 km  southwest of Anchorage. At 10,197 feet, in just over 5 miles  Mount Redoubt attains 9,150 feet  of prominence over its surrounding terrain. It is the highest summit in the Aleutian Range.\nActive for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted four times since it was first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two questionable eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000 ft  and caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume; the flight landed safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700 sq mi . The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American volcanologist Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal.", "title": "Mount Redoubt"}
