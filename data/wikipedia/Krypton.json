{"summary": "Krypton is a noble gas which means it does not react with many other elements.", "full_text": "Krypton  is a chemical element with symbol Kr and atomic number 36. It is a member of group 18  elements. A colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere, is isolated by fractionally distilling liquefied air, and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps. Krypton is inert for most practical purposes.\nKrypton, like the other noble gases, can be used in lighting and photography. Krypton light has a large number of spectral lines, and krypton's high light output in plasmas allows it to play an important role in many high-powered gas lasers , which pick out one of the many spectral lines to amplify. There is also a specific krypton fluoride laser. The high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes caused  the official length of a meter to be defined in terms of the wavelength of the 605 nm  spectral line of krypton-86.", "title": "Krypton"}
