{"summary": "An inductor is an electrical device used in electrical circuits because of magnetic charge.", "full_text": "In electromagnetism and electronics, inductance is the property of an electrical conductor by which a change in current flowing through it induces an electromotive force in both the conductor itself and in any nearby conductors by mutual inductance.\nThese effects are derived from two fundamental observations of physics: a steady current creates a steady magnetic field described by Oersted's law, and a time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force in nearby conductors, which is described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, a changing electric current through a circuit that contains inductance induces a proportional voltage, which opposes the change in current . The varying field in this circuit may also induce an e.m.f. in neighbouring circuits .\nThe term inductance was coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1886. It is customary to use the symbol L for inductance, in honour of the physicist Heinrich Lenz. In the SI system, the measurement unit for inductance is the henry with the unit symbol H, named in honor of Joseph Henry, who discovered inductance independently of, but not before, Faraday.", "title": "Inductance"}
