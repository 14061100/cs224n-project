{"summary": "In astronomy, magnitude is the logarithmic measure of the brightness of an object.", "full_text": "The apparent magnitude  of a celestial object is a measure of its brightness as seen by an observer on Earth, adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The brighter an object appears, the lower its magnitude value . In addition, the magnitude scale is logarithmic: a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of about 2.5.\nGenerally, the visible spectrum  is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude. However, other spectra are also used . In the visible spectrum, Sirius is the brightest star after the Sun. In the near-infrared J-band, Betelgeuse is the brightest. The apparent magnitude of stars is measured with a bolometer.", "title": "Apparent magnitude"}
