{"summary": "Totalitarianism is a word used to describe modern regimes  where the government controls every part of public and private behavior, including the way that people think, behave, and talk.", "full_text": "Totalitarianism is a political system where the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible. Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through an all-encompassing propaganda campaign, which is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror.\nThe concept of totalitarianism was first developed in the 1920s by the Weimar German jurist, and later Nazi academic, Carl Schmitt and Italian fascists. Schmitt used the term, Totalstaat in his influential work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, The Concept of the Political . The concept became prominent in Western anti-communist political discourse during the Cold War era, in order to highlight perceived similarities between Nazi Germany and other Fascist states on the one hand, and Soviet Communist Party states on the other.\nOther movements and governments have also been described as totalitarian. The leader of the historic Spanish reactionary conservative movement called the Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right declared his intention to \"give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity...\" and went on to say \"Democracy is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either parliament submits or we will eliminate it.\"", "title": "Totalitarian"}
