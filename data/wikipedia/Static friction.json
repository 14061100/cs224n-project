{"summary": "Friction is a force that acts to stop the movement of two touching things.", "full_text": "Friction is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, and material elements sliding against each other. There are several types of friction:\nDry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into static friction  between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces.\nFluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.\nLubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces.\nSkin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes deformation.\nWhen surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy . This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation and/or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of tribology.\nFriction is not itself a fundamental force. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from first principles impractical and necessitates the use of empirical methods for analysis and the development of theory.", "title": "Static friction"}
