{"summary": "The Admiralty was the name of the ministry which controlled the British Royal Navy.", "full_text": "The Admiralty was the organization responsible for the command of the Royal Navy in the Kingdom of England, and later in Great Britain, and until 1964 in the United Kingdom. Originally exercised by a single person, the Lord High Admiral, the Admiralty was from the early 18th century onwards almost invariably put \"in commission\" and exercised by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who sat on the Board of Admiralty.\nIn 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new Admiralty Board, which is a committee of the tri-service Defence Council of the United Kingdom and part of the Ministry of Defence. The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a Navy Board . It is common for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to as simply The Admiralty.\nThe title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the monarch from 1964 to 2011. The title was awarded to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh by Queen Elizabeth II on his 90th birthday. There also continues to be a Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom and a Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, both of which are honorary offices.\n\n", "title": "Admiralty"}
