{"summary": "Potential energy is the stored or pent-up energy of an object.", "full_text": "In physics, potential energy is the energy that an object has due to its position in a force field or that a system has due to the configuration of its shield. Common types include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of a electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units  is the joule, which has the symbol J.\nThe term potential energy was introduced by the 19th century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine, although it has links to Greek philosopher Aristotle's concept of potentiality. Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that depends only on the body's position in space. These forces can be represented by a vector at every point in space forming a vector field of forces, or a force field.\nIf the work of a force field acting on a body that moves from a start to an end position is determined only by these two positions, and does not depend on the trajectory of the body, then there is a function known as potential energy that can be evaluated at the two positions to determine this work. Furthermore, the force field is determined by this potential energy and is described as derivable from a potential.", "title": "Potential energy"}
