{"summary": "\n\nPamela Andrews is a pious, innocent fifteen-year-old who works as Lady B's maidservant in Bedfordshire. The novel starts after Lady B has died, when her son, the squire Mr. B, begins to pay Pamela more attention, first giving her his mother's clothes, then trying to seduce her in the Summer House. When he wants to pay her to keep the attempt secret, she refuses and tells Mrs. Jervis, the housekeeper, her best friend at the house. Undaunted, he hides in her closet and pops out and tries to kiss her as she undresses for bed. Pamela debates returning to her impoverished parents to preserve her innocence, but remains undecided.\nMr. B claims that he plans to marry her to Mr. Williams, his chaplain in Lincolnshire, and gives money to her parents in case she will let him take advantage of her. She refuses and decides to go back to her parents, but Mr. B intercepts her letters to her parents and tells them that she is having a love affair with a poor clergyman and that he will send her to a safe place to preserve her honour. Pamela is then driven to Lincolnshire Estate and begins a journal, hoping it will be sent to her parents one day. The Lincolnshire Estate housekeeper, Mrs. Jewkes, is no Mrs. Jervis: she is a rude, \"odious\", \"unwomanly\" woman who is devoted to Mr. B; Pamela suspects that she might even be \"an atheist!\". Mrs. Jewkes constrains Pamela to be her bedfellow. Mr. B promises that he won't approach her without her leave, and then in fact stays away from Lincolnshire for a long time.\nPamela meets Mr. Williams and they agree to communicate by putting letters under a sunflower in the garden. Mrs. Jewkes continues to maltreat Pamela, even beating her after she calls her a \"Jezebel\". Mr. Williams asks the village gentry for help; though they pity Pamela, none will help her because of Mr. B's social position. Sir Simon even argues that no one will hurt her, and no family name will be tarnished since Pamela belongs to the poor Andrews family. Mr. Williams proposes marriage to her to escape Mr. B's wickedness.\nMr. Williams is attacked and beaten by robbers. Pamela wants to escape when Mrs. Jewkes is away, but is terrified by two nearby cows that she thinks are bulls. Mr. Williams accidentally reveals his correspondence with Pamela to Mrs. Jewkes; Mr. B jealously says that he hates Pamela, as he has claimed before. He has Mr. Williams arrested and plots to marry Pamela to one of his servants. Desperate, Pamela thinks of running away and making them believe she has drowned in the pond. She tries unsuccessfully to climb a wall, and, when she is injured, she gives up.\nMr. B returns and sends Pamela a list of articles that would rule their partnership; she refuses because it means she would be his mistress. With Mrs. Jewkes' complicity, Mr. B gets into bed with Pamela disguised as the housemaid Nan, but, when Pamela falls into a fit and seems like to die, he seems to repent and is kinder in his seduction attempts. She implores him to stop altogether. In the garden he implicitly says he loves her but can't marry her because of the social gap.\n\nA gypsy fortuneteller approaches Pamela and passes her a bit of paper warning her against a sham-marriage. Pamela has hidden a parcel of letters under a rosebush; Mrs. Jewkes seizes them and gives them to Mr. B, who then feels pity for what he has put her through and decides to marry her. She still doubts him and begs him to let her return to her parents. He is vexed but lets her go. She feels strangely sad when she bids him goodbye. On her way home he sends her a letter wishing her a good life; moved, she realises she is in love. When she receives a second note asking her to come back because he is ill, she accepts.\nPamela and Mr. B talk of their future as husband and wife and she agrees with everything he says. She explains why she doubted him. This is the end of her trials: she is more submissive to him and owes him everything now as a wife. Mr. Williams is released. Neighbours come to the estate and all admire Pamela. Pamela's father comes to take her away but he is reassured when he sees Pamela happy.\nFinally, she marries Mr. B in the chapel. But when Mr. B has gone to see a sick man, his sister Lady Davers comes to threaten Pamela and considers her not really married. Pamela escapes by the window and goes in Colbrand's chariot to be taken away to Mr. B. The following day, Lady Davers enters their room without permission and insults Pamela. Mr. B, furious, wants to renounce his sister, but Pamela wants to reconcile them. Lady Davers, still contemptuous towards Pamela, mentions Sally Godfrey, a girl Mr. B seduced in his youth, now mother of his child. He is cross with Pamela because she dared approach him when he was in a temper.\nLady Davers accepts Pamela. Mr. B explains to Pamela what he expects of his wife. They go back to Bedfordshire. Pamela rewards the good servants with money and forgives John, who betrayed her. They visit a farmhouse where they meet Mr. B's daughter and learn that her mother is now happily married in Jamaica; Pamela proposes taking the girl home with them. The neighbourhood gentry who once despised Pamela now praise her.\n\n", "full_text": "PAMELA\n\nOR\n\nVIRTUE REWARDED\n\nBy Samuel Richardson\n\n\n\n\nPUBLISHERS' NOTE\n\n\nSamuel Richardson, the first, in order of time, of the great English\nnovelists, was born in 1689 and died at London in 1761. He was a printer\nby trade, and rose to be master of the Stationers' Company. That he also\nbecame a novelist was due to his skill as a letter-writer, which brought\nhim, in his fiftieth year, a commission to write a volume of model\n\"familiar letters\" as an aid to persons too illiterate to compose\ntheir own. The notion of connecting these letters by a story which\nhad interested him suggested the plot of \"Pamela\" and determined its\nepistolary form--a form which was retained in his later works.\n\nThis novel (published 1740) created an epoch in the history of English\nfiction, and, with its successors, exerted a wide influence upon\nContinental literature. It is appropriately included in a series which\nis designed to form a group of studies of English life by the masters\nof English fiction. For it marked the transition from the novel of\nadventure to the novel of character--from the narration of entertaining\nevents to the study of men and of manners, of motives and of sentiments.\nIn it the romantic interest of the story (which is of the slightest) is\nsubordinated to the moral interest in the conduct of its characters in\nthe various situations in which they are placed. Upon this aspect of the\n\"drama of human life\" Richardson cast a most observant, if not always\na penetrating glance. His works are an almost microscopically detailed\npicture of English domestic life in the early part of the eighteenth\ncentury.\n\n\n\n\n\nPAMELA, or VIRTUE REWARDED\n\n\n\n\nLETTER I\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI have great trouble, and some comfort, to acquaint you with. The\ntrouble is, that my good lady died of the illness I mentioned to you,\nand left us all much grieved for the loss of her; for she was a dear\ngood lady, and kind to all us her servants. Much I feared, that as I\nwas taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person, I should be quite\ndestitute again, and forced to return to you and my poor mother, who\nhave enough to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my lady's goodness\nhad put me to write and cast accounts, and made me a little expert at my\nneedle, and otherwise qualified above my degree, it was not every family\nthat could have found a place that your poor Pamela was fit for: but\nGod, whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch,\nput it into my good lady's heart, on her death-bed, just an hour before\nshe expired, to recommend to my young master all her servants, one by\none; and when it came to my turn to be recommended, (for I was sobbing\nand crying at her pillow) she could only say, My dear son!--and so broke\noff a little; and then recovering--Remember my poor Pamela--And these\nwere some of her last words! O how my eyes run--Don't wonder to see the\npaper so blotted.\n\nWell, but God's will must be done!--And so comes the comfort, that I\nshall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents!\nFor my master said, I will take care of you all, my good maidens; and\nfor you, Pamela, (and took me by the hand; yes, he took my hand before\nthem all,) for my dear mother's sake, I will be a friend to you, and you\nshall take care of my linen. God bless him! and pray with me, my dear\nfather and mother, for a blessing upon him, for he has given mourning\nand a year's wages to all my lady's servants; and I having no wages as\nyet, my lady having said she should do for me as I deserved, ordered the\nhousekeeper to give me mourning with the rest; and gave me with his own\nhand four golden guineas, and some silver, which were in my old lady's\npocket when she died; and said, if I was a good girl, and faithful and\ndiligent, he would be a friend to me, for his mother's sake. And so I\nsend you these four guineas for your comfort; for Providence will not\nlet me want: And so you may pay some old debt with part, and keep the\nother part to comfort you both. If I get more, I am sure it is my duty,\nand it shall be my care, to love and cherish you both; for you have\nloved and cherished me, when I could do nothing for myself. I send them\nby John, our footman, who goes your way: but he does not know what he\ncarries; because I seal them up in one of the little pill-boxes, which\nmy lady had, wrapt close in paper, that they mayn't chink; and be sure\ndon't open it before him.\n\nI know, dear father and mother, I must give you both grief and pleasure;\nand so I will only say, Pray for your Pamela; who will ever be\n\nYour most dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nI have been scared out of my senses; for just now, as I was folding up\nthis letter in my late lady's dressing-room, in comes my young master!\nGood sirs! how was I frightened! I went to hide the letter in my bosom;\nand he, seeing me tremble, said, smiling, To whom have you been writing,\nPamela?--I said, in my confusion, Pray your honour forgive me!--Only to\nmy father and mother. He said, Well then, let me see how you are come on\nin your writing! O how ashamed I was!--He took it, without saying more,\nand read it quite through, and then gave it me again;--and I said, Pray\nyour honour forgive me!--Yet I know not for what: for he was always\ndutiful to his parents; and why should he be angry that I was so to\nmine? And indeed he was not angry; for he took me by the hand, and said,\nYou are a good girl, Pamela, to be kind to your aged father and mother.\nI am not angry with you for writing such innocent matters as these:\nthough you ought to be wary what tales you send out of a family.--Be\nfaithful and diligent; and do as you should do, and I like you the\nbetter for this. And then he said, Why, Pamela, you write a very pretty\nhand, and spell tolerably too. I see my good mother's care in your\nlearning has not been thrown away upon you. She used to say you loved\nreading; you may look into any of her books, to improve yourself, so you\ntake care of them. To be sure I did nothing but courtesy and cry,\nand was all in confusion, at his goodness. Indeed he is the best of\ngentlemen, I think! But I am making another long letter: So will only\nadd to it, that I shall ever be Your dutiful daughter, PAMELA ANDREWS.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER II\n\n\n[In answer to the preceding.]\n\nDEAR PAMELA,\n\nYour letter was indeed a great trouble, and some comfort, to me and your\npoor mother. We are troubled, to be sure, for your good lady's death,\nwho took such care of you, and gave you learning, and, for three or\nfour years past, has always been giving you clothes and linen, and every\nthing that a gentlewoman need not be ashamed to appear in. But our chief\ntrouble is, and indeed a very great one, for fear you should be brought\nto anything dishonest or wicked, by being set so above yourself. Every\nbody talks how you have come on, and what a genteel girl you are; and\nsome say you are very pretty; and, indeed, six months since, when I saw\nyou last, I should have thought so myself, if you was not our child. But\nwhat avails all this, if you are to be ruined and undone!--Indeed, my\ndear Pamela, we begin to be in great fear for you; for what signify all\nthe riches in the world, with a bad conscience, and to be dishonest! We\nare, 'tis true, very poor, and find it hard enough to live; though once,\nas you know, it was better with us. But we would sooner live upon the\nwater, and, if possible, the clay of the ditches I contentedly dig, than\nlive better at the price of our child's ruin.\n\nI hope the good 'squire has no design: but when he has given you so much\nmoney, and speaks so kindly to you, and praises your coming on; and, oh,\nthat fatal word! that he would be kind to you, if you would do as you\nshould do, almost kills us with fears.\n\nI have spoken to good old widow Mumford about it, who, you know, has\nformerly lived in good families; and she puts us in some comfort; for\nshe says it is not unusual, when a lady dies, to give what she has about\nher person to her waiting-maid, and to such as sit up with her in her\nillness. But, then, why should he smile so kindly upon you? Why should\nhe take such a poor girl as you by the hand, as your letter says he has\ndone twice? Why should he stoop to read your letter to us; and commend\nyour writing and spelling? And why should he give you leave to read his\nmother's books?--Indeed, indeed, my dearest child, our hearts ache for\nyou; and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness, so taken with\nhis kind expressions, (which, truly, are very great favours, if he\nmeans well) that we fear--yes, my dear child, we fear--you should be too\ngrateful,--and reward him with that jewel, your virtue, which no riches,\nnor favour, nor any thing in this life, can make up to you.\n\nI, too, have written a long letter, but will say one thing more; and\nthat is, that, in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes, we have\ntrusted in God's goodness, and been honest, and doubt not to be happy\nhereafter, if we continue to be good, though our lot is hard here; but\nthe loss of our dear child's virtue would be a grief that we could not\nbear, and would bring our grey hairs to the grave at once.\n\nIf, then, you love us, if you wish for God's blessing, and your own\nfuture happiness, we both charge you to stand upon your guard: and,\nif you find the least attempt made upon your virtue, be sure you leave\nevery thing behind you, and come away to us; for we had rather see you\nall covered with rags, and even follow you to the churchyard, than\nhave it said, a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her\nvirtue.\n\nWe accept kindly your dutiful present; but, till we are out of pain,\ncannot make use of it, for fear we should partake of the price of our\npoor daughter's shame: so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch,\nover the window, for a while, lest we should be robbed. With our\nblessings, and our hearty prayers for you, we remain,\n\n            Your careful, but loving Father and Mother,\n                                      JOHN AND ELIZABETH ANDREWS.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER III\n\n\nDEAR FATHER,\n\nI must needs say, your letter has filled me with trouble, for it has\nmade my heart, which was overflowing with gratitude for my master's\ngoodness, suspicious and fearful: and yet I hope I shall never find him\nto act unworthy of his character; for what could he get by ruining such\na poor young creature as me? But that which gives me most trouble is,\nthat you seem to mistrust the honesty of your child. No, my dear father\nand mother, be assured, that, by God's grace, I never will do any thing\nthat shall bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. I will die a\nthousand deaths, rather than be dishonest any way. Of that be assured,\nand set your hearts at rest; for although I have lived above myself for\nsome time past, yet I can be content with rags and poverty, and bread\nand water, and will embrace them, rather than forfeit my good name,\nlet who will be the tempter. And of this pray rest satisfied, and think\nbetter of Your dutiful DAUGHTER till death.\n\nMy master continues to be very affable to me. As yet I see no cause to\nfear any thing. Mrs. Jervis, the housekeeper, too, is very civil to\nme, and I have the love of every body. Sure they can't all have designs\nagainst me, because they are civil! I hope I shall always behave so as\nto be respected by every one; and that nobody would do me more hurt than\nI am sure I would do them. Our John so often goes your way, that I will\nalways get him to call, that you may hear from me, either by writing,\n(for it brings my hand in,) or by word of mouth.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IV\n\n\nDEAR MOTHER,\n\nFor the last was to my father, in answer to his letter; and so I will\nnow write to you; though I have nothing to say, but what will make me\nlook more like a vain hussy, than any thing else: However, I hope I\nshan't be so proud as to forget myself. Yet there is a secret pleasure\none has to hear one's self praised. You must know, then, that my Lady\nDavers, who, I need not tell you, is my master's sister, has been a\nmonth at our house, and has taken great notice of me, and given me good\nadvice to keep myself to myself. She told me I was a pretty wench, and\nthat every body gave me a very good character, and loved me; and bid me\ntake care to keep the fellows at a distance; and said, that I might do,\nand be more valued for it, even by themselves.\n\nBut what pleased me much was, what I am going to tell you; for at table,\nas Mrs. Jervis says, my master and her ladyship talking of me, she told\nhim she thought me the prettiest wench she ever saw in her life; and\nthat I was too pretty to live in a bachelor's house; since no lady he\nmight marry would care to continue me with her. He said, I was vastly\nimproved, and had a good share of prudence, and sense above my\nyears; and that it would be pity, that what was my merit should be my\nmisfortune.--No, says my good lady, Pamela shall come and live with me,\nI think. He said, with all his heart; he should be glad to have me so\nwell provided for. Well, said she, I'll consult my lord about it. She\nasked how old I was; and Mrs. Jervis said, I was fifteen last February.\nO! says she, if the wench (for so she calls all us maiden servants)\ntakes care of herself, she'll improve yet more and more, as well in her\nperson as mind.\n\nNow, my dear father and mother, though this may look too vain to be\nrepeated by me; yet are you not rejoiced, as well as I, to see my master\nso willing to part with me?--This shews that he has nothing bad in his\nheart. But John is just going away; and so I have only to say, that I\nam, and will always be,\n\n                         Your honest as well as dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nPray make use of the money. You may now do it safely.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER V\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nJohn being to go your way, I am willing to write, because he is so\nwilling to carry any thing for me. He says it does him good at his heart\nto see you both, and to hear you talk. He says you are both so sensible,\nand so honest, that he always learns something from you to the purpose.\nIt is a thousand pities, he says, that such worthy hearts should not\nhave better luck in the world! and wonders, that you, my father, who are\nso well able to teach, and write so good a hand, succeeded no better in\nthe school you attempted to set up; but was forced to go to such hard\nlabour. But this is more pride to me, that I am come of such honest\nparents, than if I had been born a lady.\n\nI hear nothing yet of going to Lady Davers; and I am very easy at\npresent here: for Mrs. Jervis uses me as if I were her own daughter,\nand is a very good woman, and makes my master's interest her own. She is\nalways giving me good counsel, and I love her next to you two, I think,\nbest of any body. She keeps so good rule and order, she is mightily\nrespected by us all; and takes delight to hear me read to her; and all\nshe loves to hear read, is good books, which we read whenever we are\nalone; so that I think I am at home with you. She heard one of our men,\nHarry, who is no better than he should be, speak freely to me; I think\nhe called me his pretty Pamela, and took hold of me, as if he would have\nkissed me; for which, you may be sure, I was very angry: and she took\nhim to task, and was as angry at him as could be; and told me she was\nvery well pleased to see my prudence and modesty, and that I kept all\nthe fellows at a distance. And indeed I am sure I am not proud, and\ncarry it civilly to every body; but yet, methinks, I cannot bear to be\nlooked upon by these men-servants, for they seem as if they would look\none through; and, as I generally breakfast, dine, and sup, with Mrs.\nJervis, (so good she is to me,) I am very easy that I have so little to\nsay to them. Not but they are civil to me in the main, for Mrs. Jervis's\nsake, who they see loves me; and they stand in awe of her, knowing her\nto be a gentlewoman born, though she has had misfortunes. I am going on\nagain with a long letter; for I love writing, and shall tire you. But,\nwhen I began, I only intended to say, that I am quite fearless of any\ndanger now: and, indeed, cannot but wonder at myself, (though your\ncaution to me was your watchful love,) that I should be so foolish as\nto be so uneasy as I have been: for I am sure my master would not demean\nhimself, so as to think upon such a poor girl as I, for my harm. For\nsuch a thing would ruin his credit, as well as mine, you know: who, to\nbe sure, may expect one of the best ladies in the land. So no more at\npresent, but that I am\n\n                                           Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VI\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nMy master has been very kind since my last; for he has given me a suit\nof my late lady's clothes, and half a dozen of her shifts, and six fine\nhandkerchiefs, and three of her cambric aprons, and four holland ones.\nThe clothes are fine silk, and too rich and too good for me, to be sure.\nI wish it was no affront to him to make money of them, and send it to\nyou: it would do me more good.\n\nYou will be full of fears, I warrant now, of some design upon me, till I\ntell you, that he was with Mrs. Jervis when he gave them me; and he gave\nher a mort of good things, at the same time, and bid her wear them in\nremembrance of her good friend, my lady, his mother. And when he gave me\nthese fine things, he said, These, Pamela, are for you; have them made\nfit for you, when your mourning is laid by, and wear them for your good\nmistress's sake. Mrs. Jervis gives you a very good word; and I would\nhave you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto, and\nevery body will be your friend.\n\nI was so surprised at his goodness, that I could not tell what to say.\nI courtesied to him, and to Mrs. Jervis for her good word; and said, I\nwished I might be deserving of his favour, and her kindness: and nothing\nshould be wanting in me, to the best of my knowledge.\n\nO how amiable a thing is doing good!--It is all I envy great folks for.\n\nI always thought my young master a fine gentleman, as every body says he\nis: but he gave these good things to us both with such a graciousness,\nas I thought he looked like an angel.\n\nMrs. Jervis says, he asked her, If I kept the men at a distance? for, he\nsaid, I was very pretty; and to be drawn in to have any of them, might\nbe my ruin, and make me poor and miserable betimes. She never is wanting\nto give me a good word, and took occasion to launch out in my praise,\nshe says. But I hope she has said no more than I shall try to deserve,\nthough I mayn't at present. I am sure I will always love her, next to\nyou and my dear mother. So I rest\n\n                                    Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VII\n\n\nDEAR FATHER,\n\nSince my last, my master gave me more fine things. He called me up to my\nlate lady's closet, and, pulling out her drawers, he gave me two suits\nof fine Flanders laced headclothes, three pair of fine silk shoes, two\nhardly the worse, and just fit for me, (for my lady had a very little\nfoot,) and the other with wrought silver buckles in them; and several\nribands and top-knots of all colours; four pair of white fine cotton\nstockings, and three pair of fine silk ones; and two pair of rich stays.\nI was quite astonished, and unable to speak for a while; but yet I was\ninwardly ashamed to take the stockings; for Mrs. Jervis was not there:\nIf she had, it would have been nothing. I believe I received them very\nawkwardly; for he smiled at my awkwardness, and said, Don't blush,\nPamela: Dost think I don't know pretty maids should wear shoes and\nstockings?\n\nI was so confounded at these words, you might have beat me down with a\nfeather. For you must think, there was no answer to be made to this: So,\nlike a fool, I was ready to cry; and went away courtesying and blushing,\nI am sure, up to the ears; for, though there was no harm in what he\nsaid, yet I did not know how to take it. But I went and told all to Mrs.\nJervis, who said, God put it into his heart to be good to me; and I must\ndouble my diligence. It looked to her, she said, as if he would fit me\nin dress for a waiting-maid's place on Lady Davers's own person.\n\nBut still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head, and made all\nthese gifts nothing near to me what they would have been. But yet, I\nhope, there is no reason; for what good could it do to him to harm such\na simple maiden as me? Besides, to be sure no lady would look upon\nhim, if he should so disgrace himself. So I will make myself easy; and,\nindeed, I should never have been otherwise, if you had not put it into\nmy head; for my good, I know very well. But, may be, without these\nuneasinesses to mingle with these benefits, I might be too much puffed\nup: So I will conclude, all that happens is for our good; and God bless\nyou, my dear father and mother; and I know you constantly pray for a\nblessing upon me; who am, and shall always be,\n\n                                    Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII\n\n\nDEAR PAMELA,\n\nI cannot but renew my cautions on your master's kindness, and his free\nexpression to you about the stockings. Yet there may not be, and I hope\nthere is not, any thing in it. But when I reflect, that there possibly\nmay, and that if there should, no less depends upon it than my child's\neverlasting happiness in this world and the next; it is enough to make\none fearful for you. Arm yourself, my dear child, for the worst; and\nresolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue. What though the\ndoubts I filled you with, lessen the pleasure you would have had in your\nmaster's kindness; yet what signify the delights that arise from a few\npaltry fine clothes, in comparison with a good conscience?\n\nThese are, indeed, very great favours that he heaps upon you, but so\nmuch the more to be suspected; and when you say he looked so amiably,\nand like an angel, how afraid I am, that they should make too great an\nimpression upon you! For, though you are blessed with sense and prudence\nabove your years, yet I tremble to think, what a sad hazard a poor\nmaiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the\ntemptations of this world, and a designing young gentleman, if he should\nprove so, who has so much power to oblige, and has a kind of authority\nto command, as your master.\n\nI charge you, my dear child, on both our blessings, poor as we are, to\nbe on your guard; there can be no harm in that. And since Mrs. Jervis is\nso good a gentlewoman, and so kind to you, I am the easier a great deal,\nand so is your mother; and we hope you will hide nothing from her, and\ntake her counsel in every thing. So, with our blessings, and assured\nprayers for you, more than for ourselves, we remain,\n\nYour loving FATHER AND MOTHER.\n\nBe sure don't let people's telling you, you are pretty, puff you up; for\nyou did not make yourself, and so can have no praise due to you for\nit. It is virtue and goodness only, that make the true beauty. Remember\nthat, Pamela.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IX\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI am sorry to write you word, that the hopes I had of going to wait on\nLady Davers, are quite over. My lady would have had me; but my master,\nas I heard by the by, would not consent to it. He said her nephew might\nbe taken with me, and I might draw him in, or be drawn in by him; and he\nthought, as his mother loved me, and committed me to his care, he ought\nto continue me with him; and Mrs. Jervis would be a mother to me. Mrs.\nJervis tells me the lady shook her head, and said, Ah! brother! and that\nwas all. And as you have made me fearful by your cautions, my heart\nat times misgives me. But I say nothing yet of your caution, or my own\nuneasiness, to Mrs. Jervis; not that I mistrust her, but for fear she\nshould think me presumptuous, and vain and conceited, to have any fears\nabout the matter, from the great distance between such a gentleman, and\nso poor a girl. But yet Mrs. Jervis seemed to build something upon Lady\nDavers's shaking her head, and saying, Ah! brother! and no more. God, I\nhope, will give me his grace: and so I will not, if I can help it, make\nmyself too uneasy; for I hope there is no occasion. But every little\nmatter that happens, I will acquaint you with, that you may continue to\nme your good advice, and pray for\n\n                               Your sad-hearted PAMELA.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER X\n\n\nDEAR MOTHER,\n\nYou and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in\nso many weeks; but a sad, sad scene, has been the occasion of it. For to\nbe sure, now it is too plain, that all your cautions were well grounded.\nO my dear mother! I am miserable, truly miserable!--But yet, don't be\nfrightened, I am honest!--God, of his goodness, keep me so!\n\nO this angel of a master! this fine gentleman! this gracious benefactor\nto your poor Pamela! who was to take care of me at the prayer of his\ngood dying mother; who was so apprehensive for me, lest I should be\ndrawn in by Lord Davers's nephew, that he would not let me go to Lady\nDavers's: This very gentleman (yes, I must call him gentleman, though he\nhas fallen from the merit of that title) has degraded himself to offer\nfreedoms to his poor servant! He has now shewed himself in his true\ncolours; and, to me, nothing appear so black, and so frightful.\n\nI have not been idle; but had writ from time to time, how he, by sly\nmean degrees, exposed his wicked views; but somebody stole my letter,\nand I know not what has become of it. It was a very long one. I fear, he\nthat was mean enough to do bad things, in one respect, did not stick at\nthis. But be it as it will, all the use he can make of it will be, that\nhe may be ashamed of his part; I not of mine: for he will see I was\nresolved to be virtuous, and gloried in the honesty of my poor parents.\n\nI will tell you all, the next opportunity; for I am watched very\nnarrowly; and he says to Mrs. Jervis, This girl is always scribbling;\nI think she may be better employed. And yet I work all hours with\nmy needle, upon his linen, and the fine linen of the family; and am,\nbesides, about flowering him a waistcoat.--But, oh! my heart's broke\nalmost; for what am I likely to have for my reward, but shame and\ndisgrace, or else ill words, and hard treatment! I'll tell you all soon,\nand hope I shall find my long letter.\n\n                                       Your most afflicted DAUGHTER.\n\nMay-be, I he and him too much: but it is his own fault if I do. For why\ndid he lose all his dignity with me?\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XI\n\n\nDEAR MOTHER,\n\nWell, I can't find my letter, and so I'll try to recollect it all, and\nbe as brief as I can. All went well enough in the main for some time\nafter my letter but one. At last, I saw some reason to suspect; for he\nwould look upon me, whenever he saw me, in such a manner, as shewed not\nwell; and one day he came to me, as I was in the summer-house in the\nlittle garden, at work with my needle, and Mrs. Jervis was just gone\nfrom me; and I would have gone out, but he said, No don't go, Pamela;\nI have something to say to you; and you always fly me when I come near\nyou, as if you were afraid of me.\n\nI was much out of countenance, you may well think; but said, at last, It\ndoes not become your good servant to stay in your presence, sir, without\nyour business required it; and I hope I shall always know my place.\n\nWell, says he, my business does require it sometimes; and I have a mind\nyou should stay to hear what I have to say to you.\n\nI stood still confounded, and began to tremble, and the more when he\ntook me by the hand; for now no soul was near us.\n\nMy sister Davers, said he, (and seemed, I thought, to be as much at a\nloss for words as I,) would have had you live with her; but she would\nnot do for you what I am resolved to do, if you continue faithful and\nobliging. What say'st thou, my girl? said he, with some eagerness;\nhad'st thou not rather stay with me, than go to my sister Davers? He\nlooked so, as filled me with affrightment; I don't know how; wildly, I\nthought.\n\nI said, when I could speak, Your honour will forgive me; but as you have\nno lady for me to wait upon, and my good lady has been now dead this\ntwelvemonth, I had rather, if it would not displease you, wait upon Lady\nDavers, because--\n\nI was proceeding, and he said, a little hastily--Because you are a\nlittle fool, and know not what's good for yourself. I tell you I will\nmake a gentlewoman of you, if you be obliging, and don't stand in your\nown light; and so saying, he put his arm about me, and kissed me!\n\nNow, you will say, all his wickedness appeared plainly. I struggled and\ntrembled, and was so benumbed with terror, that I sunk down, not in a\nfit, and yet not myself; and I found myself in his arms, quite void\nof strength; and he kissed me two or three times, with frightful\neagerness.--At last I burst from him, and was getting out of the\nsummer-house; but he held me back, and shut the door.\n\nI would have given my life for a farthing. And he said, I'll do you no\nharm, Pamela; don't be afraid of me. I said, I won't stay. You won't,\nhussy! said he: Do you know whom you speak to? I lost all fear, and all\nrespect, and said, Yes, I do, sir, too well!--Well may I forget that I\nam your servant, when you forget what belongs to a master.\n\nI sobbed and cried most sadly. What a foolish hussy you are! said he:\nHave I done you any harm? Yes, sir, said I, the greatest harm in the\nworld: You have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me,\nand have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us, by\ndemeaning yourself, to be so free to a poor servant. Yet, sir, I will be\nbold to say, I am honest, though poor: and if you was a prince, I would\nnot be otherwise.\n\nHe was angry, and said, Who would have you otherwise, you foolish slut!\nCease your blubbering. I own I have demeaned myself; but it was only to\ntry you. If you can keep this matter secret, you'll give me the better\nopinion of your prudence; and here's something, said he, putting some\ngold in my hand, to make you amends for the fright I put you in. Go,\ntake a walk in the garden, and don't go in till your blubbering is over:\nand I charge you say nothing of what is past, and all shall be well, and\nI'll forgive you.\n\nI won't take the money, indeed, sir, said I, poor as I am I won't take\nit. For, to say truth, I thought it looked like taking earnest, and so\nI put it upon the bench; and as he seemed vexed and confused at what he\nhad done, I took the opportunity to open the door, and went out of the\nsummer-house.\n\nHe called to me, and said, Be secret; I charge you, Pamela; and don't go\nin yet, as I told you.\n\nO how poor and mean must those actions be, and how little must they make\nthe best of gentlemen look, when they offer such things as are unworthy\nof themselves, and put it into the power of their inferiors to be\ngreater than they!\n\nI took a turn or two in the garden, but in sight of the house, for fear\nof the worst; and breathed upon my hand to dry my eyes, because I would\nnot be too disobedient. My next shall tell you more.\n\nPray for me, my dear father and mother: and don't be angry I have not\nyet run away from this house, so late my comfort and delight, but now my\nterror and anguish. I am forced to break off hastily.\n\n                                 Your dutiful and honest DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XII\n\n\nDEAR MOTHER,\n\nWell, I will now proceed with my sad story. And so, after I had dried\nmy eyes, I went in, and began to ruminate with myself what I had best to\ndo. Sometimes I thought I would leave the house and go to the next\ntown, and wait an opportunity to get to you; but then I was at a loss to\nresolve whether to take away the things he had given me or no, and how\nto take them away: Sometimes I thought to leave them behind me, and only\ngo with the clothes on my back, but then I had two miles and a half,\nand a byway, to the town; and being pretty well dressed, I might come to\nsome harm, almost as bad as what I would run away from; and then may-be,\nthought I, it will be reported, I have stolen something, and so was\nforced to run away; and to carry a bad name back with me to my dear\nparents, would be a sad thing indeed!--O how I wished for my grey russet\nagain, and my poor honest dress, with which you fitted me out, (and hard\nenough too it was for you to do it!) for going to this place, when I\nwas not twelve years old, in my good lady's days! Sometimes I thought of\ntelling Mrs. Jervis, and taking her advice, and only feared his command\nto be secret; for, thought I, he may be ashamed of his actions, and\nnever attempt the like again: And as poor Mrs. Jervis depended upon him,\nthrough misfortunes, that had attended her, I thought it would be a sad\nthing to bring his displeasure upon her for my sake.\n\nIn this quandary, now considering, now crying, and not knowing what to\ndo, I passed the time in my chamber till evening; when desiring to be\nexcused going to supper, Mrs. Jervis came up to me, and said, Why must I\nsup without you, Pamela? Come, I see you are troubled at something; tell\nme what is the matter.\n\nI begged I might be permitted to be with her on nights; for I was afraid\nof spirits, and they would not hurt such a good person as she. That\nwas a silly excuse, she said; for why was not you afraid of spirits\nbefore?--(Indeed I did not think of that.) But you shall be my\nbed-fellow with all my heart, added she, let your reason be what it\nwill; only come down to supper. I begged to be excused; for, said I,\nI have been crying so, that it will be taken notice of by my\nfellow-servants; and I will hide nothing from you, Mrs. Jervis, when we\nare alone.\n\nShe was so good to indulge me; but made haste to come up to bed; and\ntold the servants, that I should be with her, because she could not\nrest well, and would get me to read her to sleep; for she knew I loved\nreading, she said.\n\nWhen we were alone, I told her all that had passed; for I thought,\nthough he had bid me not, yet if he should come to know I had told, it\nwould be no worse; for to keep a secret of such a nature, would be, as\nI apprehended, to deprive myself of the good advice which I never wanted\nmore; and might encourage him to think I did not resent it as I ought,\nand would keep worse secrets, and so make him do worse by me. Was I\nright, my dear mother?\n\nMrs. Jervis could not help mingling tears with my tears; for I cried all\nthe time I was telling her the story, and begged her to advise me what\nto do; and I shewed her my dear father's two letters, and she praised\nthe honesty and editing of them, and said pleasing things to me of you\nboth. But she begged I would not think of leaving my service; for,\nsaid she, in all likelihood, you behaved so virtuously, that he will\nbe ashamed of what he has done, and never offer the like to you again:\nthough, my dear Pamela, said she, I fear more for your prettiness than\nfor anything else; because the best man in the land might love you:\nso she was pleased to say. She wished it was in her power to live\nindependent; then she would take a little private house, and I should\nlive with her like her daughter.\n\nAnd so, as you ordered me to take her advice, I resolved to tarry to see\nhow things went, except he was to turn me away; although, in your first\nletter, you ordered me to come away the moment I had any reason to be\napprehensive. So, dear father and mother, it is not disobedience, I\nhope, that I stay; for I could not expect a blessing, or the good fruits\nof your prayers for me, if I was disobedient.\n\nAll the next day I was very sad, and began my long letter. He saw me\nwriting, and said (as I mentioned) to Mrs. Jervis, That girl is always\nscribbling; methinks she might find something else to do, or to that\npurpose. And when I had finished my letter, I put it under the toilet in\nmy late lady's dressing-room, whither nobody comes but myself and Mrs.\nJervis, besides my master; but when I came up again to seal it, to my\ngreat concern, it was gone; and Mrs. Jervis knew nothing of it; and\nnobody knew of my master's having been near the place in the time; so I\nhave been sadly troubled about it: But Mrs. Jervis, as well as I, thinks\nhe has it, some how or other; and he appears cross and angry, and seems\nto shun me, as much as he said I did him. It had better be so than\nworse!\n\nBut he has ordered Mrs. Jervis to bid me not pass so much time in\nwriting; which is a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take\nnotice of, as I am not idle other ways, if he did not resent what he\nthought I wrote upon. And this has no very good look.\n\nBut I am a good deal easier since I lie with Mrs. Jervis; though, after\nall, the fears I live in on one side, and his frowning and displeasure\nat what I do on the other, make me more miserable than enough.\n\nO that I had never left my little bed in the loft, to be thus exposed\nto temptations on one hand, or disgusts on the other! How happy was I\nawhile ago! How contrary now!--Pity and pray for\n\n                                         Your afflicted\n                                                  PAMELA.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIII\n\n\nMy DEAREST CHILD,\n\nOur hearts bleed for your distress, and the temptations you are exposed\nto. You have our hourly prayers; and we would have you flee this evil\ngreat house and man, if you find he renews his attempts. You ought to\nhave done it at first, had you not had Mrs. Jervis to advise with. We\ncan find no fault in your conduct hitherto: But it makes our hearts ache\nfor fear of the worst. O my child! temptations are sore things,--but\nyet, without them, we know not ourselves, nor what we are able to do.\n\nYour danger is very great; for you have riches, youth, and a fine\ngentleman, as the world reckons him, to withstand; but how great will be\nyour honour to withstand them! And when we consider your past conduct,\nand your virtuous education, and that you have been bred to be more\nashamed of dishonesty than poverty, we trust in God, that He will enable\nyou to overcome. Yet, as we can't see but your life must be a burthen to\nyou, through the great apprehensions always upon you; and that it may be\npresumptuous to trust too much to our own strength; and that you are\nbut very young; and the devil may put it into his heart to use some\nstratagem, of which great men are full, to decoy you: I think you had\nbetter come home to share our poverty with safety, than live with so\nmuch discontent in a plenty, that itself may be dangerous. God direct\nyou for the best! While you have Mrs. Jervis for an adviser and\nbed-fellow, (and, O my dear child! that was prudently done of you,)\nwe are easier than we should be; and so committing you to the divine\nprotection, remain\n\n                            Your truly loving, but careful,\n                                                     FATHER and MOTHER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIV\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nMrs. Jervis and I have lived very comfortably together for this\nfortnight past; for my master was all that time at his Lincolnshire\nestate, and at his sister's, the Lady Davers. But he came home\nyesterday. He had some talk with Mrs. Jervis soon after, and mostly\nabout me. He said to her, it seems, Well, Mrs. Jervis, I know Pamela has\nyour good word; but do you think her of any use in the family? She told\nme she was surprised at the question, but said, That I was one of the\nmost virtuous and industrious young creatures that ever she knew. Why\nthat word virtuous, said he, I pray you? Was there any reason to suppose\nher otherwise? Or has any body taken it into his head to try her?--I\nwonder, sir, says she, you ask such a question! Who dare offer any thing\nto her in such an orderly and well-governed house as yours, and under a\nmaster of so good a character for virtue and honour? Your servant, Mrs.\nJervis, says he, for your good opinion: but pray, if any body did, do\nyou think Pamela would let you know it? Why, sir, said she, she is a\npoor innocent young creature, and I believe has so much confidence in\nme, that she would take my advice as soon as she would her mother's.\nInnocent! again, and virtuous, I warrant! Well, Mrs. Jervis, you abound\nwith your epithets; but I take her to be an artful young baggage; and\nhad I a young handsome butler or steward, she'd soon make her market of\none of them, if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a husband.\nAlack-a-day, sir, said she, it is early days with Pamela; and she does\nnot yet think of a husband, I dare say: and your steward and butler are\nboth men in years, and think nothing of the matter. No, said he, if they\nwere younger, they'd have more wit than to think of such a girl; I'll\ntell you my mind of her, Mrs. Jervis: I don't think this same favourite\nof yours so very artless a girl as you imagine. I am not to dispute with\nyour honour, said Mrs. Jervis; but I dare say, if the men will let her\nalone, she'll never trouble herself about them. Why, Mrs. Jervis, said\nhe, are there any men that will not let her alone, that you know of?\nNo, indeed, sir, said she; she keeps herself so much to herself, and yet\nbehaves so prudently, that they all esteem her, and shew her as great a\nrespect as if she was a gentlewoman born.\n\nAy, says he, that's her art, that I was speaking of: but, let me tell\nyou, the girl has vanity and conceit, and pride too, or I am mistaken;\nand, perhaps, I could give you an instance of it. Sir, said she, you can\nsee farther than such a poor silly woman as I am; but I never saw any\nthing but innocence in her--And virtue too, I'll warrant ye! said he.\nBut suppose I could give you an instance, where she has talked a little\ntoo freely of the kindnesses that have been shewn her from a certain\nquarter; and has had the vanity to impute a few kind words, uttered in\nmere compassion to her youth and circumstances, into a design upon her,\nand even dared to make free with names that she ought never to mention\nbut with reverence and gratitude; what would you say to that?--Say, sir!\nsaid she, I cannot tell what to say. But I hope Pamela incapable of such\ningratitude.\n\nWell, no more of this silly girl, says he; you may only advise her,\nas you are her friend, not to give herself too much licence upon the\nfavours she meets with; and if she stays here, that she will not write\nthe affairs of my family purely for an exercise to her pen, and her\ninvention. I tell you she is a subtle, artful gipsy, and time will shew\nit you.\n\nWas ever the like heard, my dear father and mother? It is plain he did\nnot expect to meet with such a repulse, and mistrusts that I have told\nMrs. Jervis, and has my long letter too, that I intended for you; and\nso is vexed to the heart. But I can't help it. I had better be thought\nartful and subtle, than be so, in his sense; and, as light as he makes\nof the words virtue and innocence in me, he would have made a less angry\nconstruction, had I less deserved that he should do so; for then, may\nbe, my crime should have been my virtue with him naughty gentleman as he\nis!\n\nI will soon write again; but must now end with saying, that I am, and\nshall always be, Your honest DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XV\n\n\nDEAR MOTHER,\n\nI broke off abruptly my last letter; for I feared he was coming; and so\nit happened. I put the letter in my bosom, and took up my work, which\nlay by me; but I had so little of the artful, as he called it, that I\nlooked as confused as if I had been doing some great harm.\n\nSit still, Pamela, said he, mind your work, for all me.--You don't tell\nme I am welcome home, after my journey to Lincolnshire. It would be\nhard, sir, said I, if you was not always welcome to your honour's own\nhouse.\n\nI would have gone; but he said, Don't run away, I tell you. I have a\nword or two to say to you. Good sirs, how my heart went pit-a-pat!\nWhen I was a little kind to you, said he, in the summer-house, and you\ncarried yourself so foolishly upon it, as if I had intended to do you\ngreat harm, did I not tell you you should take no notice of what passed\nto any creature? and yet you have made a common talk of the matter, not\nconsidering either my reputation, or your own.--I made a common talk of\nit, sir! said I: I have nobody to talk to, hardly.\n\nHe interrupted me, and said, Hardly! you little equivocator! what do you\nmean by hardly? Let me ask you, have not you told Mrs. Jervis for one?\nPray your honour, said I, all in agitation, let me go down; for it is\nnot for me to hold an argument with your honour. Equivocator, again!\nsaid he, and took my hand, what do you talk of an argument? Is it\nholding an argument with me to answer a plain question? Answer me what I\nasked. O, good sir, said I, let me beg you will not urge me farther, for\nfear I forget myself again, and be saucy.\n\nAnswer me then, I bid you, says he, Have you not told Mrs. Jervis? It\nwill be saucy in you if you don't answer me directly to what I ask. Sir,\nsaid I, and fain would have pulled my hand away, perhaps I should be for\nanswering you by another question, and that would not become me. What is\nit you would say? replies he; speak out.\n\nThen, sir, said I, why should your honour be so angry I should tell Mrs.\nJervis, or any body else, what passed, if you intended no harm?\n\nWell said, pretty innocent and artless! as Mrs. Jervis calls you, said\nhe; and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me, insolent as you are!\nBut still I will be answered directly to my question. Why then, sir,\nsaid I, I will not tell a lie for the world: I did tell Mrs. Jervis; for\nmy heart was almost broken; but I opened not my mouth to any other. Very\nwell, boldface, said he, and equivocator again! You did not open your\nmouth to any other; but did not you write to some other? Why, now, and\nplease your honour, said I, (for I was quite courageous just then,) you\ncould not have asked me this question, if you had not taken from me\nmy letter to my father and mother, in which I own I had broken my mind\nfreely to them, and asked their advice, and poured forth my griefs!\n\nAnd so I am to be exposed, am I, said he, in my own house, and out of\nmy house, to the whole world, by such a sauce-box as you? No, good sir,\nsaid I, and I hope your honour won't be angry with me; it is not I\nthat expose you, if I say nothing but the truth. So, taunting again!\nAssurance as you are! said he: I will not be thus talked to!\n\nPray, sir, said I, of whom can a poor girl take advice, if it must not\nbe of her father and mother, and such a good woman as Mrs. Jervis, who,\nfor her sex-sake, should give it me when asked? Insolence! said he, and\nstamped with his foot, am I to be questioned thus by such a one as you?\nI fell down on my knees, and said, For Heaven's sake, your honour, pity\na poor creature, that knows nothing of her duty, but how to cherish her\nvirtue and good name: I have nothing else to trust to: and, though poor\nand friendless here, yet I have always been taught to value honesty\nabove my life. Here's ado with your honesty, said he, foolish girl! Is\nit not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master, do\nyou think? Indeed, sir, said I, it is impossible I should be ungrateful\nto your honour, or disobedient, or deserve the names of bold-face or\ninsolent, which you call me, but when your commands are contrary to that\nfirst duty which shall ever be the principle of my life!\n\nHe seemed to be moved, and rose up, and walked into the great chamber\ntwo or three turns, leaving me on my knees; and I threw my apron over my\nface, and laid my head on a chair, and cried as if my heart would break,\nhaving no power to stir.\n\nAt last he came in again, but, alas! with mischief in his heart! and\nraising me up, he said, Rise, Pamela, rise; you are your own enemy. Your\nperverse folly will be your ruin: I tell you this, that I am very\nmuch displeased with the freedoms you have taken with my name to my\nhousekeeper, as also to your father and mother; and you may as well have\nreal cause to take these freedoms with me, as to make my name suffer for\nimaginary ones. And saying so, he offered to take me on his knee, with\nsome force. O how I was terrified! I said, like as I had read in a book\na night or two before, Angels and saints, and all the host of heaven,\ndefend me! And may I never survive one moment that fatal one in which I\nshall forfeit my innocence! Pretty fool! said he, how will you forfeit\nyour innocence, if you are obliged to yield to a force you cannot\nwithstand? Be easy, said he; for let the worst happen that can, you\nwill have the merit, and I the blame; and it will be a good subject for\nletters to your father and mother, and a tale into the bargain for Mrs.\nJervis.\n\nHe by force kissed my neck and lips; and said, Whoever blamed Lucretia?\nAll the shame lay on the ravisher only and I am content to take all the\nblame upon me, as I have already borne too great a share for what I have\nnot deserved.\n\nMay I, said I, Lucretia like, justify myself with my death, if I am used\nbarbarously! O my good girl! said he, tauntingly, you are well read,\nI see; and we shall make out between us, before we have done, a pretty\nstory in romance, I warrant ye.\n\nHe then put his hand in my bosom, and indignation gave me double\nstrength, and I got loose from him by a sudden spring, and ran out of\nthe room! and the next chamber being open, I made shift to get into it,\nand threw to the door, and it locked after me; but he followed me so\nclose, he got hold of my gown, and tore a piece off, which hung without\nthe door; for the key was on the inside.\n\nI just remember I got into the room; for I knew nothing further of the\nmatter till afterwards; for I fell into a fit with my terror, and there\nI lay, till he, as I suppose, looking through the key-hole, spyed me\nupon the floor, stretched out at length, on my face; and then he called\nMrs. Jervis to me, who, by his assistance, bursting open the door, he\nwent away, seeing me coming to myself; and bid her say nothing of the\nmatter, if she was wise.\n\nPoor Mrs. Jervis thought it was worse, and cried over me like as if she\nwas my mother; and I was two hours before I came to myself; and just as\nI got a little up on my feet, he coming in, I fainted away again with\nthe terror; and so he withdrew: but he staid in the next room to let\nnobody come near us, that his foul proceedings might not be known.\n\nMrs. Jervis gave me her smelling-bottle, and had cut my laces, and set\nme in a great chair, and he called her to him: How is the girl? said he:\nI never saw such a fool in my life. I did nothing at all to her. Mrs.\nJervis could not speak for crying. So he said, She has told you, it\nseems, that I was kind to her in the summer-house, though I'll assure\nyou, I was quite innocent then as well as now; and I desire you to keep\nthis matter to yourself, and let me not be named in it.\n\nO, sir, said she, for your honour's sake, and for Christ's sake!--But\nhe would not hear her, and said--For your own sake, I tell you, Mrs.\nJervis, say not a word more. I have done her no harm. And I won't have\nher stay in my house; prating, perverse fool, as she is! But since she\nis so apt to fall into fits, or at least pretend to do so, prepare her\nto see me to-morrow after dinner, in my mother's closet, and do you be\nwith her, and you shall hear what passes between us.\n\nAnd so he went out in a pet, and ordered his chariot and four to be got\nready, and went a visiting somewhere.\n\nMrs. Jervis then came to me, and I told her all that had happened, and\nsaid, I was resolved not to stay in the house: And she replying, He\nseemed to threaten as much; I said, I am glad of that; then I shall be\neasy. So she told me all he had said to her, as above.\n\nMrs. Jervis is very loath I should go; and yet, poor woman! she begins\nto be afraid for herself; but would not have me ruined for the world.\nShe says to be sure he means no good; but may be, now he sees me so\nresolute, he will give over all attempts; and that I shall better know\nwhat to do after tomorrow, when I am to appear before a very bad judge,\nI doubt.\n\nO how I dread this to-morrow's appearance! But be as assured, my dear\nparents, of the honesty of your poor child, as I am of your prayers for\n\n                                        Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nO this frightful to-morrow; how I dread it!\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVI\n\n\nMY DEAR PARENTS,\n\nI know you longed to hear from me soon; and I send you as soon as I\ncould.\n\nWell, you may believe how uneasily I passed the time, till his appointed\nhour came. Every minute, as it grew nearer, my terrors increased; and\nsometimes I had great courage, and sometimes none at all; and I thought\nI should faint when it came to the time my master had dined. I could\nneither eat nor drink, for my part; and do what I could, my eyes were\nswelled with crying.\n\nAt last he went up to the closet, which was my good lady's\ndressing-room; a room I once loved, but then as much hated.\n\nDon't your heart ache for me?--I am sure mine fluttered about like a\nnew-caught bird in a cage. O Pamela, said I to myself, why art thou so\nfoolish and fearful? Thou hast done no harm! What, if thou fearest an\nunjust judge, when thou art innocent, would'st thou do before a just\none, if thou wert guilty? Have courage, Pamela, thou knowest the worst!\nAnd how easy a choice poverty and honesty is, rather than plenty and\nwickedness.\n\nSo I cheered myself; but yet my poor heart sunk, and my spirits were\nquite broken. Everything that stirred, I thought was to call me to my\naccount. I dreaded it, and yet I wished it to come.\n\nWell, at last he rung the bell: O, thought I, that it was my\npassing-bell! Mrs. Jervis went up, with a full heart enough, poor good\nwoman! He said, Where's Pamela? Let her come up, and do you come with\nher. She came to me: I was ready to go with my feet; but my heart\nwas with my dear father and mother, wishing to share your poverty and\nhappiness. I went up, however.\n\nO how can wicked men seem so steady and untouched with such black\nhearts, while poor innocents stand like malefactors before them!\n\nHe looked so stern, that my heart failed me, and I wished myself any\nwhere but there, though I had before been summoning up all my courage.\nGood Heaven, said I to myself, give me courage to stand before this\nnaughty master! O soften him, or harden me!\n\nCome in, fool, said he, angrily, as soon as he saw me; (and snatched my\nhand with a pull;) you may well be ashamed to see me, after your noise\nand nonsense, and exposing me as you have done. I ashamed to see you!\nthought I: Very pretty indeed!--But I said nothing.\n\nMrs. Jervis, said he, here you are both together. Do you sit down; but\nlet her stand, if she will. Ay, thought I, if I can; for my knees beat\none against the other. Did you not think, when you saw the girl in the\nway you found her in, that I had given her the greatest occasion for\ncomplaint, that could possibly be given to a woman? And that I had\nactually ruined her, as she calls it? Tell me, could you think any thing\nless? Indeed, said she, I feared so at first. Has she told you what I\ndid to her, and all I did to her, to occasion all this folly, by which\nmy reputation might have suffered in your opinion, and in that of all\nthe family.--Inform me, what she has told you?\n\nShe was a little too much frightened, as she owned afterwards, at his\nsternness, and said, Indeed she told me you only pulled her on your\nknee, and kissed her.\n\nThen I plucked up my spirits a little. Only! Mrs. Jervis? said I; and\nwas not that enough to shew me what I had to fear? When a master of his\nhonour's degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor\nservant as me, what is the next to be expected?--But your honour went\nfarther, so you did; and threatened me what you would do, and talked of\nLucretia, and her hard fate.--Your honour knows you went too far for a\nmaster to a servant, or even to his equal; and I cannot bear it. So I\nfell a crying most sadly.\n\nMrs. Jervis began to excuse me, and to beg he would pity a poor maiden,\nthat had such a value for her reputation. He said, I speak it to her\nface, I think her very pretty, and I thought her humble, and one that\nwould not grow upon my favours, or the notice I took of her; but I abhor\nthe thoughts of forcing her to any thing. I know myself better, said he,\nand what belongs to me: And to be sure I have enough demeaned myself to\ntake notice of such a one as she; but I was bewitched by her, I think,\nto be freer than became me; though I had no intention to carry the jest\nfarther.\n\nWhat poor stuff was all this, my dear mother, from a man of his sense!\nBut see how a bad cause and bad actions confound the greatest wits!--It\ngave me a little more courage then; for innocence, I find, in a low\nfortune, and weak mind, has many advantages over guilt, with all its\nriches and wisdom.\n\nSo I said, Your honour may call this jest or sport, or what you please;\nbut indeed, sir, it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a\nmaster and a servant. Do you hear, Mrs. Jervis? said he: do you hear the\npertness of the creature? I had a good deal of this sort before in the\nsummer-house, and yesterday too, which made me rougher with her than\nperhaps I had otherwise been.\n\nSays Mrs. Jervis, Pamela, don't be so pert to his honour: you should\nknow your distance; you see his honour was only in jest.--O dear Mrs.\nJervis, said I, don't you blame me too. It is very difficult to\nkeep one's distance to the greatest of men, when they won't keep it\nthemselves to their meanest servants.\n\nSee again! said he; could you believe this of the young baggage, if you\nhad not heard it? Good your honour, said the well-meaning gentlewoman,\npity and forgive the poor girl; she is but a girl, and her virtue is\nvery dear to her; and I will pawn my life for her, she will never be\npert to your honour, if you'll be so good as to molest her no more, nor\nfrighten her again. You saw, sir, by her fit, she was in terror; she\ncould not help it; and though your honour intended her no harm, yet the\napprehension was almost death to her: and I had much ado to bring her to\nherself again. O the little hypocrite! said he; she has all the arts of\nher sex; they were born with her; and I told you awhile ago you did\nnot know her. But this was not the reason principally of my calling you\nbefore me together. I find I am likely to suffer in my reputation by the\nperverseness and folly of this girl. She has told you all, and perhaps\nmore than all; nay, I make no doubt of it; and she has written letters\n(for I find she is a mighty letter-writer!) to her father and mother,\nand others, as far as I know, in which representing herself as an\nangel of light, she makes her kind master and benefactor, a devil\nincarnate--(O how people will sometimes, thought I, call themselves by\ntheir right names!)--And all this, added he, I won't hear; and so I am\nresolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken\nfrom; and let her be careful how she uses my name with freedom, when she\nis gone from me.\n\nI was brightened up at once with these welcome words, and I threw myself\nupon my knees at his feet, with a most sincere glad heart; and I said,\nMay your honour be for ever blessed for your resolution! Now I shall\nbe happy. And permit me, on my bended knees, to thank you for all the\nbenefits and favours you have heaped upon me; for the opportunities I\nhave had of improvement and learning, through my good lady's means, and\nyours. I will now forget all your honour has offered me: and I promise\nyou, that I will never let your name pass my lips, but with reverence\nand gratitude: and so God Almighty bless your honour, for ever and ever!\nAmen.\n\nThen rising from my knees, I went away with another-guise sort of\nheart than I came into his presence with: and so I fell to writing this\nletter. And thus all is happily over.\n\nAnd now, my dearest father and mother, expect to see soon your poor\ndaughter, with an humble and dutiful mind, returned to you: and don't\nfear but I know how to be as happy with you as ever: for I will be in\nthe loft, as I used to do; and pray let my little bed be got ready; and\nI have a small matter of money, which will buy me a suit of clothes,\nfitter for my condition than what I have; and I will get Mrs. Mumford\nto help me to some needle-work: and fear not that I shall be a burden\nto you, if my health continues. I know I shall be blessed, if not for\nmy own sake, for both your sakes, who have, in all your trials and\nmisfortunes, preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak\nwell of you both. But I hope he will let good Mrs. Jervis give me a\ncharacter, for fear it should be thought that I was turned away for\ndishonesty.\n\nAnd so, my dear parents, may you be blest for me, and I for you! And I\nwill always pray for my master and Mrs. Jervis. So good night; for it is\nlate, and I shall be soon called to bed.\n\nI hope Mrs. Jervis is not angry with me. She has not called me to\nsupper: though I could eat nothing if she had. But I make no doubt I\nshall sleep purely to-night, and dream that I am with you, in my dear,\ndear, happy loft once more.\n\nSo good night again, my dear father and mother, says\n\n                                          Your poor honest DAUGHTER.\n\nPerhaps I mayn't come this week, because I must get up the linen, and\nleave in order every thing belonging to my place. So send me a line, if\nyou can, to let me know if I shall be welcome, by John, who will call\nfor it as he returns. But say nothing of my coming away to him, as yet:\nfor it will be said I blab every thing.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVII\n\n\nMY DEAREST DAUGHTER,\n\nWelcome, welcome, ten times welcome shall you be to us; for you come\nto us innocent, and happy, and honest; and you are the staff of our old\nage, and our comfort. And though we cannot do for you as we would, yet,\nfear not, we shall live happily together; and what with my diligent\nlabour, and your poor mother's spinning, and your needle-work, I make no\ndoubt we shall do better and better. Only your poor mother's eyes begin\nto fail her; though, I bless God, I am as strong and able, and willing\nto labour as ever; and, O my dear child! your virtue has made me, I\nthink, stronger and better than I was before. What blessed things are\ntrials and temptations, when we have the strength to resist and subdue\nthem!\n\nBut I am uneasy about those same four guineas; I think you should give\nthem back again to your master; and yet I have broken them. Alas! I have\nonly three left; but I will borrow the fourth, if I can, part upon my\nwages, and part of Mrs. Mumford, and send the whole sum back to you,\nthat you may return it, against John comes next, if he comes again\nbefore you.\n\nI want to know how you come. I fancy honest John will be glad to bear\nyou company part of the way, if your master is not so cross as to forbid\nhim. And if I know time enough, your mother will go one five miles, and\nI will go ten on the way, or till I meet you, as far as one holiday will\ngo; for that I can get leave to make on such an occasion.\n\nAnd we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth,\nwhen all the worst was over; or than we ever had in our lives.\n\nAnd so God bless you till the happy time comes! say both your mother and\nI, which is all at present, from\n\n                               Your truly loving PARENTS.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XVIII\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI thank you a thousand tines for your goodness to me, expressed in your\nlast letter. I now long to get my business done, and come to my new old\nlot again, as I may call it. I have been quite another thing since my\nmaster has turned me off: and as I shall come to you an honest daughter,\nwhat pleasure it is to what I should have had, if I could not have seen\nyou but as a guilty one. Well, my writing-time will soon be over, and so\nI will make use of it now, and tell you all that has happened since my\nlast letter.\n\nI wondered Mrs. Jervis did not call me to sup with her, and feared she\nwas angry; and when I had finished my letter, I longed for her coming\nto bed. At last she came up, but seemed shy and reserved; and I said,\nMy dear Mrs. Jervis, I am glad to see you: you are not angry with me, I\nhope. She said she was sorry things had gone so far; and that she had\na great deal of talk with my master, after I was gone; that he seemed\nmoved at what I said, and at my falling on my knees to him, and my\nprayer for him, at my going away. He said I was a strange girl; he knew\nnot what to make of me. And is she gone? said he: I intended to say\nsomething else to her; but she behaved so oddly, that I had not power\nto stop her. She asked, if she should call me again? He said, Yes; and\nthen, No, let her go; it is best for her and me too; and she shall go,\nnow I have given her warning. Where she had it, I can't tell; but I\nnever met with the fellow of her in any life, at any age. She said,\nhe had ordered her not to tell me all: but she believed he would never\noffer any thing to me again; and I might stay, she fancied, if I would\nbeg it as a favour; though she was not sure neither.\n\nI stay! dear Mrs. Jervis; said I; why it is the best news that could\nhave come to me, that he will let me go. I do nothing but long to go\nback again to my poverty and distress, as he threatened I should; for\nthough I am sure of the poverty, I shall not have half the distress I\nhave had for some months past, I'll assure you.\n\nMrs. Jervis, dear good soul! wept over me, and said, Well, well, Pamela,\nI did not think I had shewn so little love to you, as that you should\nexpress so much joy upon leaving me. I am sure I never had a child half\nso dear to me as you are.\n\nI went to hear her so good to me, as indeed she has always been, and\nsaid, What would you have me to do, dear Mrs. Jervis? I love you next to\nmy own father and mother, and to leave you is the chief concern I have\nat quitting this place; but I am sure it is certain ruin if I stay.\nAfter such offers, and such threatenings, and his comparing himself to a\nwicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer; and turning it into\na jest, that we should make a pretty story in a romance; can I stay and\nbe safe? Has he not demeaned himself twice? And it behoves me to beware\nof the third time, for fear he should lay his snares surer; for perhaps\nhe did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much. And\nmust it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions, if\nI stay after this? For, I think, when one of our sex finds she is\nattempted, it is an encouragement to the attempter to proceed, if one\nputs one's self in the way of it, when one can help it: 'Tis neither\nmore nor less than inviting him to think that one forgives, what, in\nshort, ought not to be forgiven: Which is no small countenance to foul\nactions, I'll assure you.\n\nShe hugged me to her, and said I'll assure you! Pretty-face, where\ngottest thou all thy knowledge, and thy good notions, at these years?\nThou art a miracle for thy age, and I shall always love thee.--But, do\nyou resolve to leave us, Pamela?\n\nYes, my dear Mrs. Jervis, said I; for, as matters stand, how can I do\notherwise?--But I'll finish the duties of my place first, if I may; and\nhope you'll give me a character, as to my honesty, that it may not be\nthought I was turned away for any harm. Ay, that I will, said she; I\nwill give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved. And\nI am sure, said I, I will always love and honour you, as my third-best\nfriend, wherever I go, or whatever becomes of me.\n\nAnd so we went to bed; and I never waked till 'twas time to rise;\nwhich I did as blithe as a bird, and went about my business with great\npleasure.\n\nBut I believe my master is fearfully angry with me; for he passed by me\ntwo or three times, and would not speak to me; and towards evening, he\nmet me in the passage, going into the garden, and said such a word to\nme as I never heard in my life from him to man, woman, or child; for he\nfirst said, This creature's always in the way, I think. I said, standing\nup as close as I could, (and the entry was wide enough for a coach too,)\nI hope I shan't be long in your honour's way. D--mn you! said he, (that\nwas the hard word,) for a little witch; I have no patience with you.\n\nI profess I trembled to hear him say so; but I saw he was vexed; and,\nas I am going away, I minded it the less. Well! I see, my dear parents,\nthat when a person will do wicked things, it is no wonder he will speak\nwicked words. May God keep me out of the way of them both!\n\n                                            Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XIX\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nOur John having an opportunity to go your way, I write again, and send\nboth letters at once. I can't say, yet, when I shall get away, nor how\nI shall come, because Mrs. Jervis shewed my master the waistcoat I\nam flowering for him, and he said, It looks well enough: I think the\ncreature had best stay till she has finished it.\n\nThere is some private talk carried on betwixt him and Mrs. Jervis,\nthat she don't tell me of; but yet she is very kind to me, and I don't\nmistrust her at all. I should be very base if I did. But to be sure she\nmust oblige him, and keep all his lawful commands; and other, I dare\nsay, she won't keep: She is too good; and loves me too well; but she\nmust stay when I am gone, and so must get no ill will.\n\nShe has been at me again to ask to stay, and humble myself. But what\nhave I done, Mrs. Jervis? said I: If I have been a sauce-box, and a\nbold-face, and a pert, and a creature, as he calls me, have I not had\nreason? Do you think I should ever have forgot myself, if he had not\nforgot to act as my master? Tell me from your own heart, dear Mrs.\nJervis, said I, if you think I could stay and be safe: What would you\nthink, or how would you act in my case?\n\nMy dear Pamela, said she, and kissed me, I don't know how I should act,\nor what I should think. I hope I should act as you do. But I know nobody\nelse that would. My master is a fine gentleman; he has a great deal of\nwit and sense, and is admired, as I know, by half a dozen ladies, who\nwould think themselves happy in his addresses. He has a noble estate;\nand yet I believe he loves my good maiden, though his servant, better\nthan all the ladies in the land; and he has tried to overcome it,\nbecause you are so much his inferior; and 'tis my opinion he finds he\ncan't; and that vexes his proud heart, and makes him resolve you shan't\nstay; and so he speaks so cross to you, when he sees you by accident.\n\nWell, but, Mrs. Jervis, said I, let me ask you, if he can stoop to like\nsuch a poor girl as me, as perhaps he may, (for I have read of things\nalmost as strange, from great men to poor damsels,) What can it be\nfor?--He may condescend, perhaps, to think I may be good enough for his\nharlot; and those things don't disgrace men that ruin poor women, as the\nworld goes. And so if I was wicked enough, he would keep me till I was\nundone, and till his mind changed; for even wicked men, I have read,\nsoon grow weary of wickedness with the same person, and love variety.\nWell, then, poor Pamela must be turned off, and looked upon as a vile\nabandoned creature, and every body would despise her; ay, and justly\ntoo, Mrs. Jervis; for she that can't keep her virtue, ought to live in\ndisgrace.\n\nBut, Mrs. Jervis, I continued, let me tell you, that I hope, if I was\nsure he would always be kind to me, and never turn me off at all, that I\nshall have so much grace, as to hate and withstand his temptations, were\nhe not only my master, but my king: and that for the sin's sake. This\nmy poor dear parents have always taught me; and I should be a sad wicked\ncreature indeed, if, for the sake of riches or favour, I should forfeit\nmy good name; yea, and worse than any other young body of my sex;\nbecause I can so contentedly return to my poverty again, and think it\na less disgrace to be obliged to wear rags, and live upon rye-bread and\nwater, as I used to do, than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the\nworld.\n\nMrs. Jervis lifted up her hands, and had her eyes full of tears.\nGod bless you, my dear love! said she; you are my admiration and\ndelight.--How shall I do to part with you!\n\nWell, good Mrs. Jervis, said I, let me ask you now:--You and he have had\nsome talk, and you mayn't be suffered to tell me all. But, do you think,\nif I was to ask to stay, that he is sorry for what he has done? Ay, and\nashamed of it too? For I am sure he ought, considering his high degree,\nand my low degree, and how I have nothing in the world to trust to but\nmy honesty: Do you think in your own conscience now, (pray answer me\ntruly,) that he would never offer any thing to me again, and that I\ncould be safe?\n\nAlas! my dear child, said she, don't put thy home questions to me, with\nthat pretty becoming earnestness in thy look. I know this, that he is\nvexed at what he has done; he was vexed the first time, more vexed the\nsecond time.\n\nYes, said I, and so he will be vexed, I suppose, the third, and the\nfourth time too, till he has quite ruined your poor maiden; and who will\nhave cause to be vexed then?\n\nNay, Pamela, said she, don't imagine that I would be accessory to your\nruin for the world. I only can say, that he has, yet, done you no hurt;\nand it is no wonder he should love you, you are so pretty; though so\nmuch beneath him but, I dare swear for him, he never will offer you any\nforce.\n\nYou say, said I, that he was sorry for his first offer in the\nsummer-house. Well, and how long did his sorrow last?--Only till he\nfound me by myself; and then he was worse than before: and so became\nsorry again. And if he has deigned to love me, and you say can't help\nit, why, he can't help it neither, if he should have an opportunity,\na third time to distress me. And I have read that many a man has been\nashamed of his wicked attempts, when he has been repulsed, that would\nnever have been ashamed of them, had he succeeded. Besides, Mrs. Jervis,\nif he really intends to offer no force, What does that mean?--While you\nsay he can't help liking me, for love it cannot be--Does it not imply\nthat he hopes to ruin me by my own consent? I think, said I, (and hope\nI should have grace to do so,) that I should not give way to his\ntemptations on any account; but it would be very presumptuous in me to\nrely upon my own strength against a gentleman of his qualifications and\nestate, and who is my master; and thinks himself entitled to call me\nbold-face, and what not? only for standing on my necessary defence: and\nthat, too, where the good of my soul and body, and my duty to God, and\nmy parents, are all concerned. How then, Mrs. Jervis, said I, can I ask\nor wish to stay?\n\nWell, well, says she; as he seems very desirous you should not stay, I\nhope it is from a good motive; for fear he should be tempted to disgrace\nhimself as well as you. No, no, Mrs. Jervis, said I; I have thought\nof that too; for I would be glad to consider him with that duty that\nbecomes me: but then he would have let me go to Lady Davers, and not\nhave hindered my preferment: and he would not have said, I should return\nto my poverty and distress, when, by his mother's goodness, I had been\nlifted out of it; but that he intended to fright me, and punish me, as\nhe thought, for not complying with his wickedness: And this shews me\nwell enough what I have to expect from his future goodness, except I\nwill deserve it at his own dear price.\n\nShe was silent; and I added, Well, there's no more to be said; I must\ngo, that's certain: All my concern will be how to part with you: and,\nindeed, after you, with every body; for all my fellow-servants have\nloved me, and you and they will cost me a sigh, and a tear too, now and\nthen, I am sure. And so I fell a crying: I could not help it. For it\nis a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many\nfellow-servants, and be beloved by them all.\n\nNay, I should have told you before now, how kind and civil Mr. Longman\nour steward is; vastly courteous, indeed, on all occasions! And he said\nonce to Mrs. Jervis, he wished he was a young man for my sake; I should\nbe his wife, and he would settle all he had upon me on marriage; and,\nyou must know, he is reckoned worth a power of money.\n\nI take no pride in this; but bless God, and your good examples, my dear\nparents, that I have been enabled so to carry myself, as to have every\nbody's good word; Not but our cook one day, who is a little snappish and\ncross sometimes, said once to me, Why this Pamela of ours goes as fine\nas a lady. See what it is to have a fine face!--I wonder what the girl\nwill come to at last!\n\nShe was hot with her work; and I sneaked away; for I seldom go down into\nthe kitchen; and I heard the butler say, Why, Jane, nobody has your good\nword: What has Mrs. Pamela done to you? I am sure she offends nobody.\nAnd what, said the peevish wench, have I said to her, foolatum; but that\nshe was pretty? They quarrelled afterwards, I heard: I was sorry for it,\nbut troubled myself no more about it. Forgive this silly prattle, from\n\n                                            Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nOh! I forgot to say, that I would stay to finish the waistcoat, if I\nmight with safety. Mrs. Jervis tells me I certainly may. I never did a\nprettier piece of work; and I am up early and late to get it over; for I\nlong to be with you.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XX\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI did not send my last letters so soon as I hoped, because John (whether\nmy master mistrusts or no, I can't say) had been sent to Lady Davers's\ninstead of Isaac, who used to go; and I could not be so free with, nor\nso well trust Isaac; though he is very civil to me too. So I was forced\nto stay till John returned.\n\nAs I may not have opportunity to send again soon, and yet, as I know you\nkeep my letters, and read them over and over, (so John told me,) when\nyou have done work, (so much does your kindness make you love all that\ncomes from your poor daughter,) and as it may be some little pleasure to\nme, perhaps, to read them myself, when I am come to you, to remind me of\nwhat I have gone through, and how great God's goodness has been to me,\n(which, I hope, will further strengthen my good resolutions, that I may\nnot hereafter, from my bad conduct, have reason to condemn myself from\nmy own hand as it were): For all these reasons, I say, I will write as I\nhave time, and as matters happen, and send the scribble to you as I have\nopportunity; and if I don't every time, in form, subscribe as I ought,\nI am sure you will always believe, that it is not for want of duty. So I\nwill begin where I left off, about the talk between Mrs. Jervis and me,\nfor me to ask to stay.\n\nUnknown to Mrs. Jervis, I put a project, as I may call it, in practice.\nI thought with myself some days ago, Here I shall go home to my poor\nfather and mother, and have nothing on my back, that will be fit for\nmy condition; for how should your poor daughter look with a silk\nnight-gown, silken petticoats, cambric head-clothes, fine holland linen,\nlaced shoes that were my lady's; and fine stockings! And how in a little\nwhile must these have looked, like old cast-offs, indeed, and I looked\nso for wearing them! And people would have said, (for poor folks are\nenvious as well as rich,) See there Goody Andrews's daughter, turned\nhome from her fine place! What a tawdry figure she makes! And how well\nthat garb becomes her poor parents' circumstances!--And how would\nthey look upon me, thought I to myself, when they should come to be\nthreadbare and worn out? And how should I look, even if I could purchase\nhomespun clothes, to dwindle into them one by one, as I got them?--May\nbe, an old silk gown, and a linsey-woolsey petticoat, and the like. So,\nthought I, I had better get myself at once equipped in the dress that\nwill become my condition; and though it may look but poor to what I have\nbeen used to wear of late days, yet it will serve me, when I am with\nyou, for a good holiday and Sunday suit; and what, by a blessing on my\nindustry, I may, perhaps, make shift to keep up to.\n\nSo, as I was saying, unknown to any body, I bought of farmer Nichols's\nwife and daughters a good sad-coloured stuff, of their own spinning,\nenough to make me a gown and two petticoats; and I made robings and\nfacings of a pretty bit of printed calico I had by me.\n\nI had a pretty good camblet quilted coat, that I thought might do\ntolerably well; and I bought two flannel undercoats; not so good as\nmy swanskin and fine linen ones, but what will keep me warm, if any\nneighbour should get me to go out to help 'em to milk, now and then, as\nsometimes I used to do formerly; for I am resolved to do all your good\nneighbours what kindness I can; and hope to make myself as much beloved\nabout you, as I am here.\n\nI got some pretty good Scotch cloth, and made me, of mornings and\nnights, when nobody saw me, two shifts; and I have enough left for two\nshirts, and two shifts, for you my dear father and mother. When I come\nhome, I'll make them for you, and desire your acceptance.\n\nThen I bought of a pedlar, two pretty enough round-eared caps, a little\nstraw-hat, and a pair of knit mittens, turned up with white calico; and\ntwo pair of ordinary blue worsted hose, that make a smartish appearance,\nwith white clocks, I'll assure you; and two yards of black riband for my\nshift sleeves, and to serve as a necklace; and when I had 'em all\ncome home, I went and looked upon them once in two hours, for two days\ntogether: For, you must know, though I be with Mrs. Jervis, I keep my\nown little apartment still for my clothes, and nobody goes thither but\nmyself. You'll say I was no bad housewife to have saved so much money;\nbut my dear good lady was always giving me something.\n\nI believed myself the more obliged to do this, because, as I was turned\naway for what my good master thought want of duty; and as he expected\nother returns for his presents, than I intended to make him, so I\nthought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when I went\naway; for, you know, if I would not earn his wages, why should I have\nthem?\n\nDon't trouble yourself about the four guineas, nor borrow to make\nthem up; for they were given me, with some silver, as I told you, as a\nperquisite, being what my lady had about her when she died; and, as I\nhope for no wages, I am so vain as to think I have deserved all that\nmoney in the fourteen months, since my lady's death, for she, good soul,\noverpaid me before, in learning and other kindnesses. Had she lived,\nnone of these things might have happened!--But I ought to be thankful\n'tis no worse. Every thing will turn about for the best: that's my\nconfidence.\n\nSo, as I was saying, I have provided a new and more suitable dress, and\nI long to appear in it, more than ever I did in any new clothes in\nmy life: for then I shall be soon after with you, and at ease in my\nmind--But, mum! Here he comes, I believe.--I am, etc.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXI\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI was forced to break off: for I feared my master was coming: but it\nproved to be only Mrs. Jervis. She said, I can't endure you should be\nso much by yourself, Pamela. And I, said I, dread nothing so much as\ncompany; for my heart was up at my mouth now, for fear my master was\ncoming. But I always rejoice to see dear Mrs. Jervis.\n\nSaid she, I have had a world of talk with my master about you. I am\nsorry for it, said I, that I am made of so much consequence as to be\ntalked of by him. O, said she, I must not tell you all; but you are of\nmore consequence to him than you think for----\n\nOr wish for, said I; for the fruits of being of consequence to him,\nwould make me of none to myself, or any body else.\n\nSaid she, Thou art as witty as any lady in the land; I wonder where thou\ngottest it. But they must be poor ladies, with such great opportunities,\nI am sure, if they have no more wit than I.--But let that pass.\n\nI suppose, said I, that I am of so much consequence, however, as to vex\nhim, if it be but to think he can't make a fool of such a one as I; and\nthat is nothing at all, but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition,\nwhich he did not expect, and knows not how to put up with.\n\nThere is something in that, may be, said she: but, indeed, Pamela, he is\nvery angry with you too; and calls you twenty perverse things; wonders\nat his own folly, to have shewn you so much favour, as he calls it;\nwhich he was first inclined to, he says, for his mother's sake, and\nwould have persisted to shew you for your own, if you was not your own\nenemy.\n\nNay, now I shan't love you, Mrs. Jervis, said I; you are going to\npersuade me to ask to stay, though you know the hazards I run.--No, said\nshe, he says you shall go; for he thinks it won't be for his reputation\nto keep you: but he wished (don't speak of it for the world, Pamela,)\nthat he knew a lady of birth, just such another as yourself, in person\nand mind, and he would marry her to-morrow.\n\nI coloured up to the ears at this word: but said, Yet, if I was the lady\nof birth, and he would offer to be rude first, as he has twice done to\npoor me, I don't know whether I would have him: For she that can bear an\ninsult of that kind, I should think not worthy to be a gentleman's wife:\nany more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it.\n\nNay, now, Pamela, said she, thou carriest thy notions a great way. Well,\ndear Mrs. Jervis, said I, very seriously, for I could not help it, I am\nmore full of fears than ever. I have only to beg of you, as one of the\nbest friends I have in the world, to say nothing of my asking to\nstay. To say my master likes me, when I know what end he aims at, is\nabomination to my ears; and I shan't think myself safe till I am at my\npoor father's and mother's.\n\nShe was a little angry with me, till I assured her that I had not the\nleast uneasiness on her account, but thought myself safe under her\nprotection and friendship. And so we dropt the discourse for that time.\n\nI hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days; after which\nI have only some linen to get up, and shall then let you know how\nI contrive as to my passage; for the heavy rains will make it sad\ntravelling on foot: but may be I may get a place to which is ten miles\nof the way, in farmer Nichols's close cart; for I can't sit a horse well\nat all, and may be nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way.\nBut I hope to let you know more. From, etc.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXII\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nAll my fellow-servants have now some notion that I am to go away; but\ncan't imagine for what. Mrs. Jervis tells them, that my father and\nmother, growing in years, cannot live without me; and so I go home to\nthem, to help to comfort their old age; but they seem not to believe it.\n\nWhat they found it out by was; the butler heard him say to me, as I\npassed by him, in the entry leading to the hall, Who's that? Pamela,\nsir, said I. Pamela! said he, How long are you to stay here?--Only,\nplease your honour, said I, till I have done the waistcoat; and it\nis almost finished.--You might, says he, (very roughly indeed,) have\nfinished that long enough ago, I should have thought. Indeed, and please\nyour honour, said I, I have worked early and late upon it; there is a\ngreat deal of work in it.--Work in it! said he; You mind your pen more\nthan your needle; I don't want such idle sluts to stay in my house.\n\nHe seemed startled, when he saw the butler, as he entered the hall,\nwhere Mr. Jonathan stood. What do you here? said he.--The butler was as\nmuch confounded as I; for, never having been taxed so roughly, I could\nnot help crying sadly; and got out of both their ways to Mrs. Jervis,\nand told my complaint. This love, said she, is the d----! In how many\nstrange shapes does it make people shew themselves! And in some the\nfarthest from their hearts.\n\nSo one, and then another, has been since whispering, Pray, Mrs. Jervis,\nare we to lose Mrs. Pamela? as they always call me--What has she done?\nAnd she tells them, as above, about going home to you.\n\nShe said afterwards to me, Well, Pamela, you have made our master, from\nthe sweetest tempered gentleman in the world, one of the most peevish.\nBut you have it in your power to make him as sweet-tempered as ever;\nthough I hope you'll never do it on his terms.\n\nThis was very good in Mrs. Jervis; but it intimated, that she thought\nas ill of his designs as I; and as she knew his mind more than I, it\nconvinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could.\n\nMy master came in, just now, to speak to Mrs. Jervis about household\nmatters, having some company to dine with him to-morrow; and I stood up,\nand having been crying at his roughness in the entry, I turned away my\nface.\n\nYou may well, said he, turn away your cursed face; I wish I had never\nseen it!--Mrs. Jervis, how long is she to be about this waistcoat?\n\nSir, said I, if your honour had pleased, I would have taken it with me;\nand though it would be now finished in a few hours, I will do so still;\nand remove this hated poor Pamela out of your house and sight for ever.\n\nMrs. Jervis, said he, not speaking to me, I believe this little slut has\nthe power of witchcraft, if ever there was a witch; for she enchants all\nthat come near her. She makes even you, who should know better what the\nworld is, think her an angel of light.\n\nI offered to go away; for I believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my\nplace, for all this his great wrath: and he said, Stay here! Stay here,\nwhen I bid you! and snatched my hand. I trembled, and said, I will! I\nwill! for he hurt my fingers, he grasped me so hard.\n\nHe seemed to have a mind to say something to me; but broke off abruptly,\nand said, Begone! And away I tripped as fast as I could: and he and\nMrs. Jervis had a deal of talk, as she told me; and among the rest, he\nexpressed himself vexed to have spoken in Mr. Jonathan's hearing.\n\nNow you must know, that Mr. Jonathan, our butler, is a very grave good\nsort of old man, with his hair as white as silver! and an honest worthy\nman he is. I was hurrying out with a flea in my ear, as the saying is,\nand going down stairs into the parlour, met him. He took hold of my\nhand (in a gentler manner, though, than my master) with both his; and he\nsaid, Ah! sweet, sweet Mrs. Pamela! what is it I heard but just now!--I\nam sorry at my heart; but I am sure I will sooner believe any body in\nfault than you. Thank you, Mr. Jonathan, said I; but as you value your\nplace, don't be seen speaking to such a one as me. I cried too; and\nslipt away as fast as I could from him, for his own sake, lest he should\nbe seen to pity me.\n\nAnd now I will give you an instance how much I am in Mr. Longman's\nesteem also.\n\nI had lost my pen some how; and my paper being written out, I stepped\nto Mr. Longman's, our steward's, office, to beg him to give me a pen\nor two, and a sheet or two of paper. He said, Ay, that I will, my sweet\nmaiden! and gave me three pens, some wafers, a stick of wax, and twelve\nsheets of paper; and coming from his desk, where he was writing, he\nsaid, Let me have a word or two with you, my sweet little mistress: (for\nso these two good old gentlemen often call me; for I believe they love\nme dearly:) I hear bad news; that we are going to lose you: I hope it\nis not true. Yes it is, sir, said I; but I was in hopes it would not be\nknown till I went away.\n\nWhat a d---l, said he, ails our master of late! I never saw such an\nalteration in any man in my life! He is pleased with nobody as I see;\nand by what Mr. Jonathan tells me just now, he was quite out of the way\nwith you. What could you have done to him, tro'? Only Mrs. Jervis is a\nvery good woman, or I should have feared she had been your enemy.\n\nNo, said I, nothing like it. Mrs. Jervis is a just good woman; and,\nnext to my father and mother, the best friend I have in the world--Well,\nthen, said he, it must be worse. Shall I guess? You are too pretty, my\nsweet mistress, and, may be, too virtuous. Ah! have I not hit it? No,\ngood Mr. Longman, said I, don't think any thing amiss of my master; he\nis cross and angry with me indeed, that's true; but I may have given\noccasion for it, possibly; and because I am desirous to go to my father\nand mother, rather than stay here, perhaps he may think me ungrateful.\nBut, you know, sir, said I, that a father and mother's comfort is the\ndearest thing to a good child that can be. Sweet excellence! said he,\nthis becomes you; but I know the world and mankind too well; though I\nmust hear, and see, and say nothing. And so a blessing attend my little\nsweeting, said he, wherever you go! And away went I with a courtesy and\nthanks.\n\nNow this pleases one, my dear father and mother, to be so beloved.--How\nmuch better, by good fame and integrity, is it to get every one's good\nword but one, than, by pleasing that one, to make every one else one's\nenemy, and be an execrable creature besides! I am, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIII\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nWe had a great many neighbouring gentlemen, and their ladies, this day,\nat dinner; and my master made a fine entertainment for them: and Isaac,\nand Mr. Jonathan, and Benjamin, waited at table: And Isaac tells Mrs.\nJervis, that the ladies will by and by come to see the house, and have\nthe curiosity to see me; for, it seems, they said to my master, when\nthe jokes flew about, Well, Mr. B----, we understand you have a\nservant-maid, who is the greatest beauty in the county; and we promise\nourselves to see her before we go.\n\nThe wench is well enough, said he; but no such beauty as you talk of,\nI'll assure ye. She was my mother's waiting-maid, who, on her death-bed,\nengaged me to be kind to her. She is young, and every thing is pretty\nthat is young.\n\nAy, ay, said one of the ladies, that's true; but if your mother had not\nrecommended her so strongly, there is so much merit in beauty, that I\nmake no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to\nbe kind to it.\n\nThey all laughed at my master: And he, it seems, laughed for company;\nbut said, I don't know how it is, but I see with different eyes from\nother people; for I have heard much more talk of her prettiness, than\nI think it deserves: She is well enough, as I said: but her greatest\nexcellence is, that she is humble, and courteous, and faithful, and\nmakes all her fellow-servants love her: My housekeeper, in particular,\ndoats upon her; and you know, ladies, she is a woman of discernment:\nAnd, as for Mr. Longman, and Jonathan, here, if they thought themselves\nyoung enough, I am told, they would fight for her. Is it not true,\nJonathan? Troth, sir, said he, an't please your honour, I never knew\nher peer, and all your honour's family are of the same mind. Do you hear\nnow? said my master.--Well, said the ladies, we will make a visit to\nMrs. Jervis by and by, and hope to see this paragon.\n\nI believe they are coming; and will tell you the rest by and by. I wish\nthey had come, and were gone. Why can't they make their game without me?\n\nWell, these fine ladies have been here, and are gone back again. I would\nhave been absent, if I could, and did step into the closet: so they saw\nme when they came in.\n\nThere were four of them, Lady Arthur at the great white house on the\nhill, Lady Brooks, Lady Towers, and the other, it seems, a countess, of\nsome hard name, I forget what.\n\nSo Mrs. Jervis, says one of the ladies, how do you do? We are all come\nto inquire after your health. I am much obliged to your ladyships,\nsaid Mrs. Jervis: Will your ladyships please to sit down? But, said\nthe countess, we are not only come to ask after Mrs. Jervis's health\nneither; but we are come to see a rarity besides. Ah, says Lady Arthur,\nI have not seen your Pamela these two years, and they tell me she is\ngrown wondrous pretty in that time.\n\nThen I wished I had not been in the closet; for when I came out, they\nmust needs know I heard them; but I have often found, that bashful\nbodies owe themselves a spite, and frequently confound themselves more,\nby endeavouring to avoid confusion.\n\nWhy, yes, says Mrs. Jervis, Pamela is very pretty indeed; she's but in\nthe closet there:--Pamela, pray step hither. I came out all covered with\nblushes, and they smiled at one another.\n\nThe countess took me by the hand: Why, indeed, she was pleased to say,\nreport has not been too lavish, I'll assure you. Don't be ashamed,\nchild; (and stared full in my face;) I wish I had just such a face to be\nashamed of. O how like a fool I looked!\n\nLady Arthur said, Ay, my good Pamela, I say as her ladyship says: Don't\nbe so confused; though, indeed, it becomes you too. I think your good\nlady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant. She would\nhave been mighty proud of you, as she always was praising you, had she\nlived till now.\n\nAh! madam, said Lady Brooks, do you think that so dutiful a son as our\nneighbour, who always admired what his mother loved, does not pride\nhimself, for all what he said at table, in such a pretty maiden?\n\nShe looked with such a malicious sneering countenance, I can't abide\nher.\n\nLady Towers said with a free air, (for it seems she is called a wit,)\nWell, Mrs. Pamela, I can't say I like you so well as these ladies do;\nfor I should never care, if you were my servant, to have you and your\nmaster in the same house together. Then they all set up a great laugh.\n\nI know what I could have said, if I durst. But they are ladies--and\nladies may say any thing.\n\nSays Lady Towers, Can the pretty image speak, Mrs. Jervis? I vow she has\nspeaking eyes! O you little rogue, said she, and tapped me on the cheek,\nyou seem born to undo, or to be undone!\n\nGod forbid, and please your ladyship, said I, it should be either!--I\nbeg, said I, to withdraw; for the sense I have of my unworthiness\nrenders me unfit for such a presence.\n\nI then went away, with one of my best courtesies; and Lady Towers said,\nas I went out, Prettily said, I vow!--And Lady Brooks said, See that\nshape! I never saw such a face and shape in my life; why, she must be\nbetter descended than you have told me!\n\nAnd so they run on for half an hour more in my praises, as I was told;\nand glad was I, when I got out of the hearing of them.\n\nBut, it seems, they went down with such a story to my master, and so\nfull of me, that he had much ado to stand it; but as it was very little\nto my reputation, I am sure I could take no pride in it; and I feared\nit would make no better for me. This gives me another cause for wishing\nmyself out of this house.\n\nThis is Thursday morning, and next Thursday I hope to set out; for I\nhave finished my task, and my master is horrid cross! And I am vexed\nhis crossness affects me so. If ever he had any kindness towards me, I\nbelieve he now hates me heartily.\n\nIs it not strange, that love borders so much upon hate? But this wicked\nlove is not like the true virtuous love, to be sure: that and hatred\nmust be as far off, as light and darkness. And how must this hate have\nbeen increased, if he had met with such a base compliance, after his\nwicked will had been gratified.\n\nWell, one may see by a little, what a great deal means. For if innocence\ncannot attract common civility, what must guilt expect, when novelty\nhas ceased to have its charms, and changeableness had taken place of it?\nThus we read in Holy Writ, that wicked Amnon, when he had ruined poor\nTamar, hated her more than he ever loved her, and would have turned her\nout of door.\n\nHow happy am I, to be turned out of door, with that sweet companion my\ninnocence!--O may that be always my companion! And while I presume not\nupon my own strength, and am willing to avoid the tempter, I hope the\ndivine grace will assist me.\n\nForgive me, that I repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer. I owe\nevery thing, next to God's goodness, to your piety and good examples, my\ndear parents, my dear poor parents! I say that word with pleasure; for\nyour poverty is my pride, as your integrity shall be my imitation.\n\nAs soon as I have dined, I will put on my new clothes. I long to have\nthem on. I know I shall surprise Mrs. Jervis with them; for she shan't\nsee me till I am full dressed.--John is come back, and I'll soon send\nyou some of what I have written.--I find he is going early in the\nmorning; and so I'll close here, that I am\n\n                                   Your most dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nDon't lose your time in meeting me; because I am so uncertain. It is\nhard if, some how or other, I can't get a passage to you. But may be\nmy master won't refuse to let John bring me. I can ride behind him, I\nbelieve, well enough; for he is very careful, and very honest; and you\nknow John as well as I; for he loves you both. Besides, may be, Mrs.\nJervis can put me in some way.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIV\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI shall write on, as long as I stay, though I should have nothing but\nsilliness to write; for I know you divert yourselves on nights with\nwhat I write, because it is mine. John tells me how much you long for\nmy coming; but he says, he told you he hoped something would happen to\nhinder it.\n\nI am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away; for if\nmy fellow-servants should guess, it were better so, than to have it from\nyou or me. Besides, I really am concerned, that my master should\ncast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me; for, besides the\ndisgrace, it has quite turned his temper; and I begin to believe what\nMrs. Jervis told me, that he likes me, and can't help it; and yet\nstrives to conquer it; and so finds no way but to be cross to me.\n\nDon't think me presumptuous and conceited; for it is more my concern\nthan my pride, to see such a gentleman so demean himself, and lessen\nthe regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants, on my\naccount.--But I am to tell you of my new dress to day.\n\nAnd so, when I had dined, up stairs I went, and locked myself into my\nlittle room. There I tricked myself up as well as I could in my new\ngarb, and put on my round-eared ordinary cap; but with a green knot,\nhowever, and my homespun gown and petticoat, and plain leather shoes;\nbut yet they are what they call Spanish leather; and my ordinary hose,\nordinary I mean to what I have been lately used to; though I shall think\ngood yarn may do very well for every day, when I come home. A plain\nmuslin tucker I put on, and my black silk necklace, instead of the\nFrench necklace my lady gave me; and put the ear-rings out of my ears;\nand when I was quite equipped, I took my straw hat in my hand, with\nits two blue strings, and looked about me in the glass, as proud as any\nthing--To say truth, I never liked myself so well in my life.\n\nO the pleasure of descending with ease, innocence, and\nresignation!--Indeed, there is nothing like it! An humble mind, I\nplainly see, cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment, let\nfortune's wheel turn round as it will.\n\nSo I went down to look for Mrs. Jervis, to see how she liked me.\n\nI met, as I was upon the stairs, our Rachel, who is the house-maid; and\nshe made me a low courtesy, and I found did not know me. So I smiled,\nand went to the housekeeper's parlour; and there sat good Mrs. Jervis at\nwork, making a shift: and, would you believe it? she did not know me at\nfirst; but rose up, and pulled off her spectacles; and said, Do you want\nme, forsooth? I could not help laughing, and said, Hey-day! Mrs. Jervis,\nwhat! don't you know me?--She stood all in amaze, and looked at me\nfrom top to toe: Why, you surprise me, said she: What! Pamela thus\nmetamorphosed! How came this about?\n\nAs it happened, in stept my master; and my back being to him, he thought\nit was a stranger speaking to Mrs. Jervis, and withdrew again: and did\nnot hear her ask, If his honour had any commands for her?--She turned me\nabout and about, and I shewed her all my dress, to my under-petticoat:\nand she said, sitting down, Why, I am all in amaze, I must sit down.\nWhat can all this mean? I told her, I had no clothes suitable to my\ncondition when I returned to my father's; and so it was better to begin\nhere, as I was soon to go away, that all my fellow-servants might see I\nknew how to suit myself to the state I was returning to.\n\nWell, said she, I never knew the like of thee. But this sad preparation\nfor going away (for now I see you are quite in earnest) is what I know\nnot how to get over. O my dear Pamela, how can I part with you!\n\nMy master rung in the back-parlour, and so I withdrew, and Mrs. Jervis\nwent to attend him. It seems, he said to her, I was coming in to let\nyou know, that I shall go to Lincolnshire, and possibly to my sister\nDavers's, and be absent some weeks. But, pray, what pretty neat damsel\nwas with you? She says, she smiled, and asked, If his honour did not\nknow who it was? No, said he, I never saw her before. Farmer Nichols,\nor Farmer Brady, have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a\ndaughter! have they?--Though I did not see her face neither, said he.\nIf your honour won't be angry, said she, I will introduce her into your\npresence; for I think, says she, she outdoes our Pamela.\n\nNow I did not thank her for this, as I told her afterwards, (for it\nbrought a great deal of trouble upon me, as well as crossness, as you\nshall hear). That can't be, he was pleased to say. But if you can find\nan excuse for it, let her come in.\n\nAt that she stept to me, and told me, I must go in with her to her\nmaster; but, said she, for goodness' sake, let him find you out; for he\ndon't know you. O fie, Mrs. Jervis, said I, how could you serve me so?\nBesides, it looks too free both in me, and to him. I tell you, said she,\nyou shall come in; and pray don't reveal yourself till he finds you out.\n\nSo I went in, foolish as I was; though I must have been seen by him\nanother time, if I had not then. And she would make me take my straw hat\nin my hand.\n\nI dropt a low courtesy, but said never a word. I dare say he knew me as\nsoon as he saw my face: but was as cunning as Lucifer. He came up to me,\nand took me by the hand, and said, Whose pretty maiden are you?--I dare\nsay you are Pamela's sister, you are so like her. So neat, so clean, so\npretty! Why, child, you far surpass your sister Pamela!\n\nI was all confusion, and would have spoken: but he took me about the\nneck: Why, said he, you are very pretty, child: I would not be so free\nwith your sister, you may believe; but I must kiss you.\n\nO sir, said I, I am Pamela, indeed I am: indeed I am Pamela, her own\nself!\n\nHe kissed me for all I could do; and said, Impossible! you are a\nlovelier girl by half than Pamela; and sure I may be innocently free\nwith you, though I would not do her so much favour.\n\nThis was a sad trick upon me, indeed, and what I could not expect; and\nMrs. Jervis looked like a fool as much as I, for her officiousness.--At\nlast I got away, and ran out of the parlour, most sadly vexed, as you\nmay well think.\n\nHe talked a good deal to Mrs. Jervis, and at last ordered me to come\nin to him. Come in, said he, you little villain!--for so he called me.\n(Good sirs! what a name was there!)--who is it you put your tricks upon?\nI was resolved never to honour your unworthiness, said he, with so much\nnotice again; and so you must disguise yourself to attract me, and yet\npretend, like an hypocrite as you are----\n\nI was out of patience then: Hold, good sir, said I; don't impute\ndisguise and hypocrisy to me, above all things; for I hate them both,\nmean as I am. I have put on no disguise.--What a plague, said he, for\nthat was his word, do you mean then by this dress?--Why, and please your\nhonour, said I, I mean one of the honestest things in the world.\n\nI have been in disguise, indeed, ever since my good lady your mother\ntook me from my poor parents. I came to her ladyship so poor and mean,\nthat these clothes I have on, are a princely suit to those I had then:\nand her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes, and other bounties: and as\nI am now returning to my poor parents again so soon, I cannot wear those\ngood things without being hooted at; and so have bought what will be\nmore suitable to my degree, and be a good holiday-suit too, when I get\nhome.\n\nHe then took me in his arms, and presently pushed me from him. Mrs.\nJervis, said he, take the little witch from me; I can neither bear,\nnor forbear her--(Strange words these!)--But stay; you shan't go!--Yet\nbegone!--No, come back again.\n\nI thought he was mad, for my share; for he knew not what he would have.\nI was going, however; but he stept after me, and took hold of my arm,\nand brought me in again: I am sure he made my arm black and blue; for\nthe marks are upon it still. Sir, sir, said I, pray have mercy; I will,\nI will come in!\n\nHe sat down, and looked at me, and, as I thought afterwards, as sillily\nas such a poor girl as I. At last he said, Well, Mrs. Jervis, as I was\ntelling you, you may permit her to stay a little longer, till I see if\nmy sister Davers will have her; if, mean time, she humble herself, and\nask this as a favour, and is sorry for her pertness, and the liberty\nshe has taken with my character out of the house, and in the house.\nYour honour indeed told me so, said Mrs. Jervis: but I never found her\ninclinable to think herself in a fault. Pride and perverseness, said he,\nwith a vengeance! Yet this is your doating-piece!--Well, for once,\nI'll submit myself to tell you, hussy, said he to me, you may stay a\nfortnight longer, till I see my sister Davers: Do you hear what I say to\nyou, statue? Can you neither speak nor be thankful?--Your honour frights\nme so, said I, that I can hardly speak: But I will venture to say,\nthat I have only to beg, as a favour, that I may go to my father and\nmother.--Why fool, said he, won't you like to go to wait on my sister\nDavers? Sir, said I, I was once fond of that honour; but you were\npleased to say, I might be in danger from her ladyship's nephew, or he\nfrom me.--D----d impertinence! said he; Do you hear, Mrs. Jervis, do you\nhear, how she retorts upon me? Was ever such matchless assurance!----\n\nI then fell a weeping; for Mrs. Jervis said, Fie, Pamela, fie!--And I\nsaid, My lot is very hard indeed; I am sure I would hurt nobody; and\nI have been, it seems, guilty of indiscretions, which have cost me my\nplace, and my master's favour, and so have been turned away: and\nwhen the time is come, that I should return to my poor parents, I am not\nsuffered to go quietly. Good your honour, what have I done, that I must\nbe used worse than if I had robbed you?\n\nRobbed me! said he, why so you have, hussy; you have robbed me. Who? I,\nsir? said I; have I robbed you? Why then you are a justice of peace, and\nmay send me to gaol, if you please, and bring me to a trial for my life!\nIf you can prove that I have robbed you, I am sure I ought to die.\n\nNow I was quite ignorant of his meaning; though I did not like it, when\nit was afterwards explained, neither: And well, thought I, what will\nthis come to at last, if poor Pamela is esteemed a thief! Then I thought\nin an instant, how I should shew my face to my honest poor parents, if\nI was but suspected. But, sir, said I, let me ask you but one question,\nand pray don't let me be called names for it; for I don't mean\ndisrespectfully: Why, if I have done amiss, am I not left to be\ndischarged by your housekeeper, as the other maids have been? And if\nJane, or Rachel, or Hannah, were to offend, would your honour stoop\nto take notice of them? And why should you so demean yourself to take\nnotice of me? Pray, sir, if I have not been worse than others, why\nshould I suffer more than others? and why should I not be turned away,\nand there's an end of it? For indeed I am not of consequence enough for\nmy master to concern himself, and be angry about such a creature as me.\n\nDo you hear, Mrs. Jervis, cried he again, how pertly I am interrogated\nby this saucy slut? Why, sauce-box, says he, did not my good\nmother desire me to take care of you? And have you not been always\ndistinguished by me, above a common servant? And does your ingratitude\nupbraid me for this?\n\nI said something mutteringly, and he vowed he would hear it. I begged\nexcuse; but he insisted upon it. Why, then, said I, if your honour must\nknow, I said, That my good lady did not desire your care to extend to\nthe summer-house, and her dressing-room.\n\nWell, this was a little saucy, you'll say--And he flew into such a\npassion, that I was forced to run for it; and Mrs. Jervis said, It was\nhappy I got out of the way.\n\nWhy what makes him provoke one so, then?--I'm almost sorry for it; but\nI would be glad to get away at any rate. For I begin to be more fearful\nnow.\n\nJust now Mr. Jonathan sent me these lines--(Bless me! what shall I do?)\n\n'Dear Mrs. Pamela, Take care of yourself; for Rachel heard my master say\nto Mrs. Jervis, who, she believes, was pleading for you, Say no more,\nMrs. Jervis; for by G--d I will have her! Burn this instantly.'\n\nO pray for your poor daughter. I am called to go to bed by Mrs. Jervis,\nfor it is past eleven; and I am sure she shall hear of it; for all this\nis owing to her, though she did not mean any harm. But I have been, and\nam, in a strange fluster; and I suppose too, she'll say, I have been\nfull pert.\n\nO my dear father and mother, power and riches never want advocates! But,\npoor gentlewoman, she cannot live without him: and he has been very good\nto her.\n\nSo good night. May be I shall send this in the morning; but may be not;\nso won't conclude: though I can't say too often, that I am (though with\ngreat apprehension)\n\n                     Your most dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXV\n\n\nMY DEAR PARENTS,\n\nO let me take up my complaint, and say, Never was poor creature so\nunhappy, and so barbarously used, as poor Pamela! Indeed, my dear father\nand mother, my heart's just broke! I can neither write as I should do,\nnor let it alone, for to whom but you can I vent my griefs, and keep my\npoor heart from bursting! Wicked, wicked man!--I have no patience when\nI think of him!--But yet, don't be frightened--for--I hope--I hope, I am\nhonest!--But if my head and my hand will let me, you shall hear all.--Is\nthere no constable, nor headborough, though, to take me out of his\nhouse? for I am sure I can safely swear the peace against him: But,\nalas! he is greater than any constable: he is a justice himself: Such a\njustice deliver me from!--But God Almighty, I hope, in time, will right\nme--For he knows the innocence of my heart!\n\nJohn went your way in the morning; but I have been too much distracted\nto send by him; and have seen nobody but Mrs. Jervis or Rachel, and\none I hate to see or be seen by and indeed I hate now to see any body.\nStrange things I have to tell you, that happened since last night, that\ngood Mr. Jonathan's letter, and my master's harshness, put me into such\na fluster; but I will not keep you in suspense.\n\nI went to Mrs. Jervis's chamber; and, O dreadful! my wicked master had\nhid himself, base gentleman as he is! in her closet, where she has a\nfew books, and chest of drawers, and such like. I little suspected it;\nthough I used, till this sad night, always to look into that closet\nand another in the room, and under the bed, ever since the summer-house\ntrick; but never found any thing; and so I did not do it then, being\nfully resolved to be angry with Mrs. Jervis for what had happened in the\nday, and so thought of nothing else.\n\nI sat myself down on one side of the bed, and she on the other, and we\nbegan to undress ourselves; but she on that side next the wicked closet,\nthat held the worst heart in the world. So, said Mrs. Jervis, you won't\nspeak to me, Pamela! I find you are angry with me. Why, Mrs. Jervis,\nsaid I, so I am, a little; 'tis a folly to deny it. You see what I have\nsuffered by your forcing me in to my master: and a gentlewoman of your\nyears and experience must needs know, that it was not fit for me to\npretend to be any body else for my own sake, nor with regard to my\nmaster.\n\nBut, said she, who would have thought it would have turned out so? Ay,\nsaid I, little thinking who heard me, Lucifer always is ready to promote\nhis own work and workmen. You see presently what use he made of it,\npretending not to know me, on purpose to be free with me. And when he\ntook upon himself to know me, to quarrel with me, and use me hardly: And\nyou too, said I, to cry, Fie, fie, Pamela! cut me to the heart: for that\nencouraged him.\n\nDo you think, my dear, said she, that I would encourage him?--I never\nsaid so to you before; but, since you have forced it from me, I must\ntell you, that, ever since you consulted me, I have used my utmost\nendeavours to divert him from his wicked purposes: and he has promised\nfair; but, to say all in a word, he doats upon you; and I begin to see\nit is not in his power to help it.\n\nI luckily said nothing of the note from Mr. Jonathan; for I began to\nsuspect all the world almost: but I said, to try Mrs. Jervis, Well then,\nwhat would you have me do? You see he is for having me wait on Lady\nDavers now.\n\nWhy, I'll tell you freely, my dear Pamela, said she, and I trust to your\ndiscretion to conceal what I say: my master has been often desiring me\nto put you upon asking him to let you stay----\n\nYes, said I, Mrs. Jervis, let me interrupt you: I will tell you why I\ncould not think of that: It was not the pride of my heart, but the pride\nof my honesty: For what must have been the case? Here my master has been\nvery rude to me, once and twice; and you say he cannot help it, though\nhe pretends to be sorry for it: Well, he has given me warning to leave\nmy place, and uses me very harshly; perhaps to frighten me to his\npurposes, as he supposes I would be fond of staying (as indeed I should,\nif I could be safe; for I love you and all the house, and value him, if\nhe would act as my master). Well then, as I know his designs, and that\nhe owns he cannot help it; must I have asked to stay, knowing he would\nattempt me again? for all you could assure me of, was, he would do\nnothing by force; so I, a poor weak girl, was to be left to my own\nstrength! And was not this to allow him to tempt me, as one may say? and\nto encourage him to go on in his wicked devices?--How then, Mrs. Jervis,\ncould I ask or wish to stay?\n\nYou say well, my dear child, says she; and you have a justness of\nthought above your years; and for all these considerations, and for what\nI have heard this day, after you ran away, (and I am glad you went as\nyou did,) I cannot persuade you to stay; and I shall be glad, (which\nis what I never thought I could have said,) that you were well at your\nfather's; for if Lady Davers will entertain you, she may as well have\nyou from thence as here. There's my good Mrs. Jervis! said I; God will\nbless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden, that is hard beset.\nBut pray what did he say, when I was gone? Why, says she, he was very\nangry with you. But he would hear it! said I: I think it was a little\nbold; but then he provoked me to it. And had not my honesty been in the\ncase, I would not by any means have been so saucy. Besides, Mrs.\nJervis, consider it was the truth; if he does not love to hear of the\nsummer-house, and the dressing-room, why should he not be ashamed to\ncontinue in the same mind? But, said she, when you had muttered this to\nyourself, you might have told him any thing else. Well, said I, I cannot\ntell a wilful lie, and so there's an end of it. But I find you now give\nhim up, and think there's danger in staying.--Lord bless me! I wish I\nwas well out of the house; so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch, on\nthe wildest common in England.\n\nWhy, said she, it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was\nenough to make me fear you would not be so safe as I could wish;\nand, upon my word, Pamela, I don't wonder he loves you; for, without\nflattery, you are a charming girl! and I never saw you look more lovely\nin your life than in that same new dress of yours. And then it was such\na surprise upon us all!--I believe truly, you owe some of your danger to\nthe lovely appearance you made. Then, said I, I wish the clothes in the\nfire: I expected no effect from them; but, if any, a quite contrary one.\n\nHush! said I, Mrs. Jervis, did you not hear something stir in the\ncloset? No, silly girl, said she, your fears are always awake.--But\nindeed, said I, I think I heard something rustle.--May be, says she, the\ncat may be got there: but I hear nothing.\n\nI was hush; but she said, Pr'ythee, my good girl, make haste to bed. See\nif the door be fast. So I did, and was thinking to look into the closet;\nbut, hearing no more noise, thought it needless, and so went again and\nsat myself down on the bed-side, and went on undressing myself. And\nMrs. Jervis being by this time undressed, stepped into bed, and bid me\nhasten, for she was sleepy.\n\nI don't know what was the matter, but my heart sadly misgave me: Indeed,\nMr. Jonathan's note was enough to make it do so, with what Mrs. Jervis\nhad said. I pulled off my stays, and my stockings, and all my clothes to\nan under-petticoat; and then hearing a rustling again in the closet, I\nsaid, Heaven protect us! but before I say my prayers, I must look into\nthis closet. And so was going to it slip-shod, when, O dreadful! out\nrushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown.\n\nI screamed, and ran to the bed, and Mrs. Jervis screamed too; and he\nsaid, I'll do you no harm, if you forbear this noise; but otherwise take\nwhat follows.\n\nInstantly he came to the bed (for I had crept into it, to Mrs. Jervis,\nwith my coat on, and my shoes); and taking me in his arms, said, Mrs.\nJervis, rise, and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down\nat this noise: I'll do no harm to this rebel.\n\nO, for Heaven's sake! for pity's sake! Mrs. Jervis, said I, if I am not\nbetrayed, don't leave me; and, I beseech you, raise all the house. No,\nsaid Mrs. Jervis, I will not stir, my dear lamb; I will not leave you.\nI wonder at you, sir, said she; and kindly threw herself upon my coat,\nclasping me round the waist: You shall not hurt this innocent, said she:\nfor I will lose my life in her defence. Are there not, said she, enough\nwicked ones in the world, for your base purpose, but you must attempt\nsuch a lamb as this?\n\nHe was desperate angry, and threatened to throw her out of the window;\nand to turn her out of the house the next morning. You need not, sir,\nsaid she; for I will not stay in it. God defend my poor Pamela\ntill to-morrow, and we will both go together.--Says he, let me but\nexpostulate a word or two with you, Pamela. Pray, Pamela, said Mrs.\nJervis, don't hear a word, except he leaves the bed, and goes to\nthe other end of the room. Ay, out of the room, said I; expostulate\nto-morrow, if you must expostulate!\n\nI found his hand in my bosom; and when my fright let me know it, I was\nready to die; and I sighed and screamed, and fainted away. And still he\nhad his arms about my neck; and Mrs. Jervis was about my feet, and upon\nmy coat. And all in a cold dewy sweat was I. Pamela! Pamela! said Mrs.\nJervis, as she tells me since, O--h, and gave another shriek, my poor\nPamela is dead for certain! And so, to be sure, I was for a time; for I\nknew nothing more of the matter, one fit following another, till about\nthree hours after, as it proved to be, I found myself in bed, and Mrs.\nJervis sitting upon one side, with her wrapper about her, and Rachel on\nthe other; and no master, for the wicked wretch was gone. But I was so\noverjoyed, that I hardly could believe myself; and I said, which were my\nfirst words, Mrs. Jervis, Mrs. Rachel, can I be sure it is you? Tell\nme! can I?--Where have I been? Hush, my dear, said Mrs. Jervis; you have\nbeen in fit after fit. I never saw any body so frightful in my life!\n\nBy this I judged Rachel knew nothing of the matter; and it seems my\nwicked master had, upon Mrs. Jervis's second noise on my fainting away,\nslipt out, and, as if he had come from his own chamber, disturbed by\nthe screaming, went up to the maids' room, (who, hearing the noise, lay\ntrembling, and afraid to stir,) and bid them go down, and see what was\nthe matter with Mrs. Jervis and me. And he charged Mrs. Jervis, and\npromised to forgive her for what she had said and done, if she would\nconceal the matter. So the maids came down, and all went up again, when\nI came to myself a little, except Rachel, who staid to sit up with me,\nand bear Mrs. Jervis company. I believe they all guess the matter to be\nbad enough; though they dare not say any thing.\n\nWhen I think of my danger, and the freedoms he actually took, though I\nbelieve Mrs. Jervis saved me from worse, and she said she did, (though\nwhat can I think, who was in a fit, and knew nothing of the matter?) I\nam almost distracted.\n\nAt first I was afraid of Mrs. Jervis; but I am fully satisfied she is\nvery good, and I should have been lost but for her; and she takes on\ngrievously about it. What would have become of me, had she gone out of\nthe room, to still the maids, as he bid her! He'd certainly have shut\nher out, and then, mercy on me! what would have become of your poor\nPamela?\n\nI must leave off a little; for my eyes and my head are sadly bad.--This\nwas a dreadful trial! This was the worst of all! Oh, that I was out of\nthe power of this dreadfully wicked man! Pray for\n\n                                             Your distressed DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVI\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI did not rise till ten o'clock, and I had all the concerns and wishes\nof the family, and multitudes of inquiries about me. My wicked master\nwent out early to hunt; but left word he would be in to breakfast. And\nso he was.\n\nHe came up to our chamber about eleven, and had nothing to do to be\nsorry; for he was our master, and so put on sharp anger at first.\n\nI had great emotions at his entering the room, and threw my apron over\nmy head, and fell a crying, as if my heart would break.\n\nMrs. Jervis, said he, since I know you, and you me so well, I don't know\nhow we shall live together for the future. Sir, said she, I will take\nthe liberty to say, what I think is best for both. I have so much\ngrief, that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl, and\nespecially in my chamber, that I should think myself accessary to the\nmischief, if I was not to take notice of it. Though my ruin, therefore,\nmay depend upon it, I desire not to stay; but pray let poor Pamela and\nme go together. With all my heart, said he; and the sooner the better.\nShe fell a crying. I find, says he, this girl has made a party of the\nwhole house in her favour against me. Her innocence deserves it of us\nall, said she very kindly: and I never could have thought that the son\nof my dear good lady departed, could have so forfeited his honour, as to\nendeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect. No more of this,\nMrs. Jervis! said he; I will not hear it. As for Pamela, she has a lucky\nknack of falling into fits, when she pleases. But the cursed yellings\nof you both made me not myself. I intended no harm to her, as I told you\nboth, if you'd have left your squallings: And I did no harm neither, but\nto myself; for I raised a hornet's nest about my ears, that, as far as I\nknow, may have stung to death my reputation. Sir, said Mrs. Jervis, then\nI beg Mr. Longman may take my accounts, and I will go away as soon as\nI can. As for Pamela, she is at her liberty, I hope, to go away next\nThursday, as she intends?\n\nI sat still; for I could not speak nor look up, and his presence\ndiscomposed me extremely; but I was sorry to hear myself the unhappy\noccasion of Mrs. Jervis's losing her place, and hope that may be still\nmade up.\n\nWell, said he, let Mr. Longman make up your accounts, as soon as you\nwill; and Mrs. Jewkes (who is his housekeeper in Lincolnshire) shall\ncome hither in your place, and won't be less obliging, I dare say, than\nyou have been. Said she, I have never disobliged you till now; and let\nme tell you, sir, if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or\nhonour--No more, no more, said he, of these antiquated topics. I have\nbeen no bad friend to you; and I shall always esteem you, though you\nhave not been so faithful to my secrets as I could have wished, and have\nlaid me open to this girl, which has made her more afraid of me than she\nhad occasion. Well, sir, said she, after what passed yesterday, and last\nnight, I think I went rather too far in favour of your injunctions\nthan otherwise; and I should have deserved every body's censure, as the\nbasest of creatures, had I been capable of contributing to your lawless\nattempts. Still, Mrs. Jervis, still reflecting upon me, and all for\nimaginary faults! for what harm have I done the girl?--I won't bear it,\nI'll assure you. But yet, in respect to my mother, I am willing to part\nfriendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom\nof your conversation, in relation to me; which I should have resented\nmore than I do, but that I am conscious I had no business to demean\nmyself so as to be in your closet, where I might have expected to hear a\nmultitude of impertinence between you.\n\nWell, sir, said she, you have no objection, I hope, to Pamela's going\naway on Thursday next? You are mighty solicitous, said he, about Pamela:\nBut no, not I; let her go as soon as she will: She is a naughty girl,\nand has brought all this upon herself; and upon me more trouble than she\ncan have had from me: But I have overcome it all, and will never concern\nmyself about her.\n\nI have a proposal made me, added he, since I have been out this morning,\nthat I shall go near to embrace; and so wish only, that a discreet use\nmay be made of what is past; and there's an end of every thing with me,\nas to Pamela, I'll assure you. I clasped my hands together through my\napron, overjoyed at this, though I was soon to go away: For, naughty as\nhe has been to me, I wish his prosperity with all my heart, for my good\nold lady's sake. Well, Pamela, said he, you need not now be afraid to\nspeak to me; tell me what you lifted up your hands at? I said not a\nword. Says he, If you like what I have said, give me your hand upon it.\nI held my hand up through my apron; for I could not speak to him; and he\ntook hold of it, and pressed it, though less hard than he did my arm the\nday before. What does the little fool cover her face for? said he: Pull\nyour apron away; and let me see how you look, after your freedom of\nspeech of me last night. No wonder you are ashamed to see me. You know\nyou were very free with my character.\n\nI could not stand this barbarous insult, as I took it to be, considering\nhis behaviour to me; and I then spoke and said, O the difference between\nthe minds of thy creatures, good God! How shall some be cast down in\ntheir innocence, while others can triumph in their guilt!\n\nAnd so saying, I went up stairs to my chamber, and wrote all this; for\nthough he vexed me at his taunting, yet I was pleased to hear he was\nlikely to be married, and that his wicked intentions were so happily\novercome as to me; and this made me a little easier. And I hope I have\npassed the worst; or else it is very hard. And yet I shan't think\nmyself at ease quite, till I am with you: For, methinks, after all,\nhis repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon. But the\ndivine grace is not confined to space; and remorse may, and I hope has,\nsmitten him to the heart at once, for his injuries to poor me! Yet I\nwon't be too secure neither.\n\nHaving opportunity, I send now what I know will grieve you to the heart.\nBut I hope I shall bring my next scribble myself; and so conclude,\nthough half broken-hearted, Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVII\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI am glad I desired you not to meet me, and John says you won't; for\nhe told you he is sure I shall get a passage well enough, either behind\nsome one of my fellow-servants on horseback, or by farmer Nichols's\nmeans: but as to the chariot he talked to you of, I can't expect that\nfavour, to be sure; and I should not care for it, because it would look\nso much above me. But farmer Brady, they say, has a chaise with one\nhorse, and we hope to borrow that, or hire it, rather than fail; though\nmoney runs a little lowish, after what I have laid out; but I don't\ncare to say so here; though I warrant I might have what I would of Mrs.\nJervis, or Mr. Jonathan, or Mr. Longman; but then how shall I pay it?\nyou'll say: And, besides, I don't love to be beholden.\n\nBut the chief reason I'm glad you don't set out to meet me, is the\nuncertainty; for it seems I must stay another week still, and hope\ncertainly to go Thursday after. For poor Mrs. Jervis will go at the same\ntime, she says, and can't be ready before.\n\nOh! that I was once well with you!--Though he is very civil too at\npresent, and not so cross as he was: and yet he is as vexatious another\nway, as you shall hear. For yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes\nbrought home, which they call a birth-day suit; for he intends to go to\nLondon against next birth-day, to see the court; and our folks will have\nit he is to be made a lord.--I wish they may make him an honest man, as\nhe was always thought; but I have not found it so, alas for me!\n\nAnd so, as I was saying, he had these clothes come home, and he tried\nthem on. And before he pulled them off, he sent for me, when nobody else\nwas in the parlour with him: Pamela, said he, you are so neat and so\nnice in your own dress, (Alack-a-day, I didn't know I was!) that you\nmust be a judge of ours. How are these clothes made? Do they fit me?--I\nam no judge, said I, and please your honour; but I think they look very\nfine.\n\nHis waistcoat stood on end with silver lace, and he looked very grand.\nBut what he did last, has made me very serious, and I could make him no\ncompliments. Said he, Why don't you wear your usual clothes? Though I\nthink every thing looks well upon you (for I still continue in my new\ndress). I said, I have no clothes, sir, I ought to call my own, but\nthese: and it is no matter what such an one as I wears. Said he, Why you\nlook very serious, Pamela. I see you can bear malice.--Yes, so I can,\nsir, said I, according to the occasion! Why, said he, your eyes always\nlook red, I think. Are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to\nheart? I am sure you, and that fool Mrs. Jervis, frightened me, by your\nhideous squalling, as much as I could frighten you. That is all we\nhad for it, said I; and if you could be so afraid of your own servants\nknowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature, that is under\nyour protection while I stay, surely your honour ought to be more afraid\nof God Almighty, in whose presence we all stand, in every action of\nour lives, and to whom the greatest, as well as the least, must be\naccountable, let them think what they list.\n\nHe took my hand, in a kind of good-humoured mockery, and said, Well\nurged, my pretty preacher! When my Lincolnshire chaplain dies, I'll\nput thee on a gown and cassock, and thou'lt make a good figure in\nhis place.--I wish, said I, a little vexed at his jeer, your honour's\nconscience would be your preacher, and then you would need no other\nchaplain. Well, well, Pamela, said he, no more of this unfashionable\njargon. I did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit,\nas to tell you, you are welcome to stay, since Mrs. Jervis desires it,\ntill she goes. I welcome! said I; I am sure I shall rejoice when I am\nout of the house!\n\nWell, said he, you are an ungrateful baggage; but I am thinking it would\nbe pity, with these fair soft hands, and that lovely skin, (as he called\nit, and took hold of my hand,) that you should return again to hard\nwork, as you must if you go to your father's; and so I would advise her\nto take a house in London, and let lodgings to us members of parliament,\nwhen we come to town; and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for,\nwill always fill her house, and she'll get a great deal of money.\n\nI was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke; but being ready to cry before,\nthe tears gushed out, and (endeavouring to get my hand from him, but in\nvain) I said, I can expect no better: Your behaviour, sir, to me, has\nbeen just of a piece with these words: Nay, I will say it, though you\nwere to be ever so angry.--I angry, Pamela? No, no, said he, I have\novercome all that; and as you are to go away, I look upon you now as\nMrs. Jervis's guest while you both stay, and not as my servant; and so\nyou may say what you will. But I'll tell you, Pamela, why you need not\ntake this matter in such high disdain!--You have a very pretty romantic\nturn for virtue, and all that.--And I don't suppose but you'll hold\nit still: and nobody will be able to prevail upon you. But, my child,\n(sneeringly he spoke it,) do but consider what a fine opportunity you\nwill then have for a tale every day to good mother Jervis, and what\nsubjects for letter-writing to your father and mother, and what pretty\npreachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen. Ad's my heart! I\nthink it would be the best thing you and she could do.\n\nYou do well, sir, said I, to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me:\nbut, permit me to say, that if you was not rich and great, and I poor\nand little, you would not insult me thus.--Let me ask you, sir, if you\nthink this becomes your fine clothes, and a master's station: Why so\nserious, my pretty Pamela? said he: Why so grave? And would kiss me; but\nmy heart was full, and I said, Let me alone; I will tell you, if you was\na king, and insulted me as you have done, that you have forgotten to\nact like a gentleman; and I won't stay to be used thus: I will go to the\nnext farmer's, and there wait for Mrs. Jervis, if she must go: and I'd\nhave you know, sir, that I can stoop to the ordinariest work of your\nscullions, for all these nasty soft hands, sooner than bear such\nungentlemanly imputations.\n\nI sent for you, said he, in high good humour; but it is impossible to\nhold it with such an impertinent: however, I'll keep my temper. But\nwhile I see you here, pray don't put on those dismal grave looks: Why,\ngirl, you should forbear them, if it were but for your pride-sake; for\nthe family will think you are grieving to leave the house. Then, sir,\nsaid I, I will try to convince them of the contrary, as well as your\nhonour; for I will endeavour to be more cheerful while I stay, for that\nvery reason.\n\nWell, replied he, I will set this down by itself, as the first time that\never what I had advised had any weight with you. And I will add, said\nI, as the first advice you have given me of late, that was fit to be\nfollowed.--I wish said he, (I am almost ashamed to write it, impudent\ngentleman as he is!) I wish I had thee as quick another way, as thou art\nin thy repartees--And he laughed, and I snatched my hand from him, and I\ntripped away as fast as I could. Ah! thought I, married? I am sure it is\ntime you were married, or, at this rate, no honest maiden ought to live\nwith you.\n\nWhy, dear father and mother, to be sure he grows quite a rake! How easy\nit is to go from bad to worse, when once people give way to vice!\n\nHow would my poor lady, had she lived, have grieved to see it! but may\nbe he would have been better then! Though it seems he told Mrs. Jervis,\nhe had an eye upon me in his mother's life-time; and he intended to let\nme know as much, by the bye, he told her! Here is shamelessness for you!\nSure the world must be near at an end! for all the gentlemen about are\nas bad as he almost, as far as I can hear!--And see the fruits of\nsuch bad examples! There is 'Squire Martin in the grove, has had three\nlyings-in, it seems, in his house, in three months past; one by himself;\nand one by his coachman; and one by his woodman; and yet he has turned\nnone of them away. Indeed, how can he, when they but follow his own vile\nexample? There is he, and two or three more such as he, within ten miles\nof us, who keep company, and hunt with our fine master, truly; and I\nsuppose he is never the better for their examples. But, Heaven bless me,\nsay I, and send me out of this wicked house!\n\nBut, dear father and mother, what sort of creatures must the womenkind\nbe, do you think, to give way to such wickedness? Why, this it is that\nmakes every one be thought of alike: And, alack-a-day! what a world we\nlive in! for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted, than\nthat the women comply. This, I suppose, makes me such a sauce-box, and\nbold-face, and a creature, and all because I won't be a sauce-box and\nbold-face indeed.\n\nBut I am sorry for these things; one don't know what arts and stratagems\nmen may devise to gain their vile ends; and so I will think as well as\nI can of these poor undone creatures, and pity them. For you see, by my\nsad story, and narrow escapes, what hardships poor maidens go through,\nwhose lot it is to go out to service, especially to houses where there\nis not the fear of God, and good rule kept by the heads of the family.\n\nYou see I am quite grown grave and serious; indeed it becomes the\npresent condition of Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVIII\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nJohn says you wept when you read my last letter, that he carried. I am\nsorry you let him see that; for they all mistrust already how matters\nare, and as it is no credit that I have been attempted, though it is\nthat I have resisted; yet I am sorry they have cause to think so evil of\nmy master from any of us.\n\nMrs. Jervis has made up her accounts with Mr. Longman, and will stay in\nher place. I am glad of it, for her own sake, and for my master's; for\nshe has a good master of him; so indeed all have, but poor me--and he\nhas a good housekeeper in her.\n\nMr. Longman, it seems, took upon him to talk to my master, how faithful\nand careful of his interests she was, and how exact in her accounts;\nand he told him, there was no comparison between her accounts and Mrs.\nJewkes's, at the Lincolnshire estate.\n\nHe said so many fine things, it seems, of Mrs. Jervis, that my master\nsent for her in Mr. Longman's presence, and said Pamela might come along\nwith her; I suppose to mortify me, that I must go while she was to stay:\nBut as, when I go away, I am not to go with her, nor was she to go with\nme; so I did not matter it much; only it would have been creditable to\nsuch a poor girl, that the housekeeper would bear me company, if I went.\n\nSaid he to her, Well, Mrs. Jervis, Longman says you have made up your\naccounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness. I had a good\nmind to make you an offer of continuing with me, if you can be a little\nsorry for your hasty words, which, indeed, were not so respectful as\nI have deserved at your hands. She seemed at a sad loss what to say,\nbecause Mr. Longman was there, and she could not speak of the occasion\nof those words, which was me.\n\nIndeed, said Mr. Longman, I must needs say before your face, that since\nI have known my master's family, I have never found such good management\nin it, nor so much love and harmony neither. I wish the Lincolnshire\nestate was as well served!--No more of that, said my master; but Mrs.\nJervis may stay, if she will: and here, Mrs. Jervis, pray accept of\nthis, which at the close of every year's accounts I will present you\nwith, besides your salary, as long as I find your care so useful and\nagreeable. And he gave her five guineas.--She made him a low courtesy,\nand thanking him, looked to me, as if she would have spoken to me.\n\nHe took her meaning, I believe; for he said,--Indeed I love to encourage\nmerit and obligingness, Longman; but I can never be equally kind to\nthose who don't deserve it at my hands, as to those who do; and then he\nlooked full on me. Longman, continued he, I said that girl might come\nin with Mrs. Jervis, because they love to be always together. For Mrs.\nJervis is very good to her, and loves her as well as if she was her\ndaughter. But else--Mr. Longman, interrupting him, said, Good to Mrs.\nPamela! Ay, sir, and so she is, to be sure! But every body must be good\nto her; for----\n\nHe was going on: but my master said, No more, no more, Mr. Longman. I\nsee old men are taken with pretty young girls, as well as other folks;\nand fair looks hide many a fault, where a person has the art to behave\nobligingly. Why, and please your honour, said Mr. Longman, every\nbody--and was going on, I believe, to say something more in my praise,\nbut he interrupted him, and said, Not a word more of this Pamela. I\ncan't let her stay, I'll assure you; not only for her own freedom of\nspeech, but her letter-writing of all the secrets of my family. Ay, said\nthe good old man, I am sorry for that too! But, sir,--No more, I say,\nsaid my master; for my reputation is so well known, (mighty fine,\nthought I!) that I care not what any body writes or says of me: But to\ntell you the truth, (not that it need go further,) I think of changing\nmy condition soon; and, you know, young ladies of birth and fortune will\nchoose their own servants, and that's my chief reason why Pamela can't\nstay. As for the rest, said he, the girl is a good sort of body,\ntake her altogether; though I must needs say, a little pert, since my\nmother's death, in her answers, and gives me two words for one; which I\ncan't bear; nor is there reason I should, you know, Longman. No, to be\nsure, sir, said he: but 'tis strange, methinks, she should be so mild\nand meek to every one of us in the house, and forget herself so, where\nshe should shew most respect! Very true, Mr. Longman, said he, but so it\nis, I'll assure you; and it was from her pertness, that Mrs. Jervis and\nI had the words: And I should mind it the less, but that the girl (there\nshe stands, I say it to her face) has wit and sense above her years, and\nknows better.\n\nI was in great pain to say something, but yet I knew not what, before\nMr. Longman; and Mrs. Jervis looked at me, and walked to the window to\nhide her concern for me. At last, I said, It is for you, sir, to say\nwhat you please; and for me only to say, God bless your honour!\n\nPoor Mr. Longman faltered in his speech, and was ready to cry. Said my\ninsulting master to me, Why, pr'ythee, Pamela, now, shew thyself as thou\nart, before Longman. Can'st not give him a specimen of that pertness\nwhich thou hast exercised upon me sometimes?\n\nDid he not, my dear father and mother, deserve all the truth to be told?\nYet I overcame myself so far, as to say, Well, your honour may play upon\na poor girl, that you know can answer you, but dare not.\n\nWhy, pr'ythee now, insinuator, said he, say the worst you can before\nLongman and Mrs. Jervis. I challenge the utmost of thy impertinence:\nand as you are going away, and have the love of every body, I would be\na little justified to my family, that you have no reason to complain\nof hardships from me, as I have pert saucy answers from you, besides\nexposing me by your letters.\n\nSurely, sir, said I, I am of no consequence equal to this, in your\nhonour's family, that such a great gentleman as you, should need to\njustify yourself about me. I am glad Mrs. Jervis stays with your honour;\nand I know I have not deserved to stay: and, more than that, I don't\ndesire to stay.\n\nAds-bobbers! said Mr. Longman, and ran to me; don't say so, don't say\nso, dear Mrs. Pamela! We all love you dearly: and pray down of your\nknees, and ask his honour pardon, and we will all become pleaders in a\nbody, and I, and Mrs. Jervis too, at the head of it, to beg his honour's\npardon, and to continue you, at least, till his honour marries.--No, Mr.\nLongman, said I, I cannot ask; nor will I stay, if I might. All I desire\nis, to return to my poor father and mother: and though I love you all, I\nwon't stay.--O well-a-day, well-a-day! said the good old man, I did not\nexpect this!--When I had got matters thus far, and had made all up for\nMrs. Jervis, I was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all\nthe family, in your pardon too. Well, said my master, this is a little\nspecimen of what I told you, Longman. You see there's a spirit you did\nnot expect.\n\nMrs. Jervis told me after, that she could stay no longer, to hear me so\nhardly used; and must have spoken, had she staid, what would never have\nbeen forgiven her; so she went out. I looked after her to go too; but\nmy master said, Come, Pamela, give another specimen, I desire you, to\nLongman I am sure you must, if you will but speak. Well, sir, said I,\nsince it seems your greatness wants to be justified by my lowness, and\nI have no desire you should suffer in the sight of your family, I will\nsay, on my bended knees, (and so I kneeled down,) that I have been a\nvery faulty, and a very ungrateful creature to the best of masters: I\nhave been very perverse and saucy; and have deserved nothing at your\nhands but to be turned out of your family with shame and disgrace. I,\ntherefore, have nothing to say for myself, but that I am not worthy to\nstay, and so cannot wish to stay, and will not stay: And so God Almighty\nbless you, and you Mr. Longman, and good Mrs. Jervis, and every living\nsoul of the family! and I will pray for you as long as I live!--And so\nI rose up, and was forced to lean upon my master's elbow-chair, or I\nshould have sunk down.\n\nThe poor old man wept more than I, and said, Ads-bobbers, was ever the\nlike heard! 'Tis too much, too much; I can't bear it. As I hope to live,\nI am quite melted. Dear sir, forgive her! The poor thing prays for\nyou; she prays for us all! She owns her fault; yet won't be forgiven! I\nprofess I know not what to make of it.\n\nMy master himself, hardened wretch as he was, seemed a little moved, and\ntook his handkerchief out of his pocket, and walked to the window:\nWhat sort of a day is it? said he.--And then, getting a little more\nhard-heartedness, he said, Well, you may be gone from my presence, thou\nstrange medley of inconsistence! but you shan't stay after your time in\nthe house.\n\nNay, pray, sir, pray, sir, said the good old man, relent a little.\nAds-heartikins! you young gentlemen are made of iron and steel, I think;\nI'm sure, said he, my heart's turned into butter, and is running away\nat my eyes. I never felt the like before.--Said my master, with an\nimperious tone, Get out of my presence, hussy! I can't bear you in my\nsight. Sir, said I, I'm going as fast as I can.\n\nBut, indeed, my dear father and mother, my head was so giddy, and my\nlimbs trembled so, that I was forced to go holding by the wainscot all\nthe way with both my hands, and thought I should not have got to the\ndoor: But when I did, as I hoped this would be my last interview with\nthis terrible hard-hearted master, I turned about, and made a low\ncourtesy, and said, God bless you, sir! God bless you, Mr. Longman!\nand I went into the lobby leading to the great hall, and dropt into the\nfirst chair; for I could get no farther a good while.\n\nI leave all these things to your reflection, my dear parents but I can\nwrite no more. My poor heart's almost broken! Indeed it is--O when shall\nI get away!--Send me, good God, in safety, once more to my poor father's\npeaceful cot!--and there the worst that can happen will be joy in\nperfection to what I now bear!--O pity\n\n                                      Your distressed DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIX\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI must write on, though I shall come so soon; for now I have hardly any\nthing else to do. I have finished all that lay upon me, and only wait\nthe good time of setting out. Mrs. Jervis said, I must be low in pocket,\nfor what I had laid out; and so would have presented me with two\nguineas of her five; but I could not take them of her, because, poor\ngentlewoman, she pays old debts for her children, that were extravagant,\nand wants them herself. This, though, was very good in her.\n\nI am sorry I shall have but little to bring with me; but I know you\nwon't, you are so good!--and I will work the harder, when I come home,\nif I can get a little plain-work, or any thing, to do. But all your\nneighbourhood is so poor, that I fear I shall want work, except, may\nbe, dame Mumford can help me to something, from any good family she is\nacquainted with.\n\nHere, what a sad thing it is! I have been brought up wrong, as matters\nstand. For, you know, my good lady, now in heaven, loved singing and\ndancing; and, as she would have it, I had a voice, she made me learn\nboth; and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song, and\na good psalm too, and dance before her. And I must learn to flower and\ndraw too, and to work fine work with my needle; why, all this too I have\ngot pretty tolerably at my finger's end, as they say; and she used to\npraise me, and was a good judge of such matters.\n\nWell now, what is all this to the purpose, as things have turned about?\n\nWhy, no more nor less, than that I am like the grasshopper in the fable,\nwhich I have read of in my lady's book, as follows:--[See the Aesop's\nFables which have lately been selected and reformed from those of Sir R.\nL'Estrange, and the most eminent mythologists.]\n\n'As the ants were airing their provisions one winter, a hungry\ngrasshopper (as suppose it was poor I) begged a charity of them. They\ntold him, That he should have wrought in summer, if he would not\nhave wanted in winter. Well, says the grasshopper, but I was not idle\nneither; for I sung out the whole season. Nay, then, said they, you'll\ne'en do well to make a merry year of it, and dance in winter to the time\nyou sung in summer.'\n\nSo I shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing, when I\ncome home to you! Nay, I shall be unfit even for a May-day holiday-time;\nfor these minuets, rigadoons, and French dances, that I have been\npractising, will make me but ill company for my milk-maid companions\nthat are to be. To be sure I had better, as things stand, have learned\nto wash and scour, and brew and bake, and such like. Put I hope, if I\ncan't get work, and can meet with a place, to learn these soon, if\nany body will have the goodness to bear with me till I am able: For,\nnotwithstanding what my master says, I hope I have an humble and\nteachable mind; and, next to God's grace, that's all my comfort: for I\nshall think nothing too mean that is honest. It may be a little hard at\nfirst; but woe to my proud heart, if I find it so on trial; for I will\nmake it bend to its condition, or break it.\n\nI have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion; and\nhe tried how he could bear it, by putting his fingers into the lighted\ncandle: So I, t'other day, tried, when Rachel's back was turned, if\nI could not scour a pewter plate she had begun. I see I could do't by\ndegrees: It only blistered my hand in two places.\n\nAll the matter is, if I could get plain-work enough, I need not spoil\nmy fingers. But if I can't, I hope to make my hands as red as a\nblood-pudding, and as hard as a beechen trencher, to accommodate them to\nmy condition.--But I must break off; here's somebody coming.\n\n'Tis only our Hannah with a message from Mrs. Jervis.--But, hold, here's\nsomebody else. Well, it is only Rachel.\n\nI am as much frighted, as were the city mouse and the country mouse, in\nthe same book of fables, at every thing that stirs. O! I have a power of\nthese things to entertain you with in winter evenings, when I come home.\nIf I can but get work, with a little time for reading, I hope we shall\nbe very happy over our peat fires.\n\nWhat made me hint to you, that I should bring but little with me, is\nthis:\n\nYou must know, I did intend to do, as I have this afternoon: and that\nis, I took all my clothes, and all my linen, and I divided them into\nthree parcels, as I had before told Mrs. Jervis I intended to do; and\nI said, It is now Monday, Mrs. Jervis, and I am to go away on Thursday\nmorning betimes; so, though I know you don't doubt my honesty, I beg you\nwill look over my poor matters, and let every one have what belongs to\nthem; for, said I, you know I am resolved to take with me only what I\ncan properly call my own.\n\nSaid she, (I did not know her drift then; to be sure she meant well;\nbut I did not thank her for it, when I did know it,) Let your things be\nbrought down in the green-room, and I will do any thing you will have me\ndo.\n\nWith all my heart, said I, green-room or any where; but I think you\nmight step up, and see 'em as they lie.\n\nHowever, I fetched 'em down, and laid them in three parcels, as before;\nand, when I had done, I went down to call her up to look at them.\n\nNow, it seems, she had prepared my master for this scene, unknown to\nme; and in this green-room was a closet, with a sash-door, and a curtain\nbefore it; for there she puts her sweet-meats and such things; and\nshe did it, it seems, to turn his heart, as knowing what I intended, I\nsuppose that he should make me take the things; for, if he had, I should\nhave made money of them, to help us when we got together; for, to be\nsure, I could never have appeared in them.\n\nWell, as I was saying, he had got, unknown to me, into this closet; I\nsuppose while I went to call Mrs. Jervis: and she since owned to me, it\nwas at his desire, when she told him something of what I intended, or\nelse she would not have done it: though I have reason, I am sure, to\nremember the last closet-work.\n\nSo I said, when she came up, Here, Mrs. Jervis, is the first parcel;\nI will spread it all abroad. These are the things my good lady gave\nme.--In the first place, said I--and so I went on describing the clothes\nand linen my lady had given me, mingling blessings, as I proceeded,\nfor her goodness to me; and when I had turned over that parcel, I said,\nWell, so much for the first parcel, Mrs. Jervis; that was my lady's\ngifts.\n\nNow I come to the presents of my dear virtuous master: Hey, you know\ncloset for that! Mrs. Jervis. She laughed, and said, I never saw such a\ncomical girl in my life! But go on. I will, Mrs. Jervis, said I, as soon\nas I have opened the bundle; for I was as brisk and as pert as could be,\nlittle thinking who heard me.\n\nNow here, Mrs. Jervis, said I, are my ever worthy master's presents; and\nthen I particularised all those in the second bundle.\n\nAfter which, I turned to my own, and said,\n\nNow, Mrs. Jervis, comes poor Pamela's bundle; and a little one it is to\nthe others. First, here is a calico nightgown, that I used to wear o'\nmornings. 'Twill be rather too good for me when I get home; but I must\nhave something. Then there is a quilted calamanco coat, and a pair of\nstockings I bought of the pedlar, and my straw-hat with blue strings;\nand a remnant of Scots cloth, which will make two shirts and two shifts,\nthe same I have on, for my poor father and mother. And here are four\nother shifts, one the fellow to that I have on; another pretty good one,\nand the other two old fine ones, that will serve me to turn and wind\nwith at home, for they are not worth leaving behind me; and here are two\npair of shoes, I have taken the lace off, which I will burn, and may be\nwill fetch me some little matter at a pinch, with an old silver buckle\nor two.\n\nWhat do you laugh for, Mrs. Jervis? said I.--Why you are like an April\nday; you cry and laugh in a breath.\n\nWell, let me see; ay, here is a cotton handkerchief I bought of the\npedlar--there should be another somewhere. O, here it is! and here too\nare my new-bought knit mittens; and this is my new flannel coat, the\nfellow to that I have on and in this parcel, pinned together, are\nseveral pieces of printed calico, remnants of silks, and such like,\nthat, if good luck should happen, and I should get work, would serve\nfor robins and facings, and such like uses. And here too are a pair of\npockets: they are too fine for me; but I have no worse. Bless me, said\nI, I did not think I had so many good things!\n\nWell, Mrs. Jervis, said I, you have seen all my store, and I will now\nsit down, and tell you a piece of my mind.\n\nBe brief then, said she, my good girl: for she was afraid, she said\nafterwards, that I should say too much.\n\nWhy then the case is this: I am to enter upon a point of equity and\nconscience, Mrs. Jervis; and I must beg, if you love me, you'd let me\nhave my own way. Those things there of my lady's, I can have no claim\nto, so as to take them away; for she gave them me, supposing I was to\nwear them in her service, and to do credit to her bountiful heart. But,\nsince I am to be turned away, you know, I cannot wear them at my poor\nfather's; for I should bring all the little village upon my back; and so\nI resolve not to have them.\n\nThen, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I have far less right to these of my worthy\nmaster's; for you see what was his intention in giving them to me. So\nthey were to be the price of my shame, and if I could make use of them,\nI should think I should never prosper with them; and, besides, you know,\nMrs. Jervis, if I would not do the good gentleman's work, why should\nI take his wages? So, in conscience, in honour, in every thing, I have\nnothing to say to thee, thou second wicked bundle!\n\nBut, said I, cone to my arms, my dear third parcel, the companion of\nmy poverty, and the witness of my honesty; and may I never deserve the\nleast rag that is contained in thee, when I forfeit a title to that\ninnocence, that I hope will ever be the pride of my life! and then I am\nsure it will be my highest comfort at my death, when all the riches and\npomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn\nby beggars! And so I hugged my third bundle.\n\nBut, said I, Mrs. Jervis, (and she wept to hear me,) one thing more I\nhave to trouble you with, and that's all.\n\nThere are four guineas, you know, that came out of my good lady's\npocket, when she died; that, with some silver, my master gave me: Now\nthese same four guineas I sent to my poor father and mother, and they\nhave broken them; but would make them up, if I would: and if you think\nit should be so, it shall. But pray tell me honestly your mind: As to\nthe three years before my lady's death, do you think, as I had no wages,\nI may be supposed to be quits?--By quits, I cannot mean that my poor\nservices should be equal to my lady's goodness; for that's impossible.\nBut as all her learning and education of me, as matters have turned,\nwill be of little service to me now; for it had been better for me to\nhave been brought up to hard labour, to be sure; for that I must turn\nto at last, if I can't get a place: (and you know, in places too, one is\nsubject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of:) so, I say, by\nquits I only mean, as I return all the good things she gave me, whether\nI may not set my little services against my keeping; because, as I said,\nmy learning is not now in the question; and I am sure my dear good lady\nwould have thought so, had she lived; but that too is now out of the\nquestion. Well then, if so, I would ask, Whether, in above this year\nthat I have lived with my master, as I am resolved to leave all his\ngifts behind me, I may not have earned, besides my keeping, these four\nguineas, and these poor clothes here upon my back, and in my third\nbundle? Now tell me your mind freely, without favour or affection.\n\nAlas! my dear girl, says she, you make me unable to speak to you at all:\nTo be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered, for you\nto leave any of these things behind you; and you must take all your\nbundles with you, or my master will never forgive you.\n\nWell, well, Mrs. Jervis, said I, I don't care; I have been too much used\nto be snubbed and hardly treated by my master, of late. I have done him\nno harm; and I shall always pray for him and wish him happy. But I don't\ndeserve these things; I know I don't. Then, I can't wear them, if I\nshould take them; so they can be of no use to me: And I trust I shall\nnot want the poor pittance, that is all I desire to keep life and soul\ntogether. Bread and water I can live upon, Mrs. Jervis, with content.\nWater I shall get any where; and if I can't get me bread, I will live\nlike a bird in winter upon hips and haws, and at other times upon\npig-nuts and potatoes, or turnips, or any thing. So what occasion have I\nfor these things?--But all I ask is about these four guineas, and if you\nthink I need not return them, that is all I want to know.--To be sure,\nmy dear, you need not, said she; you have well earned them by that\nwaistcoat only. No, I think not so, in that only; but in the linen, and\nother things, do you think I have? Yes, yes, said she, and more. And my\nkeeping allowed for, I mean, said I, and these poor clothes on my back,\nbesides? Remember that, Mrs. Jervis. Yes, my dear odd-one, no doubt you\nhave. Well then, said I, I am as happy as a princess. I am quite as rich\nas I wish to be: and once more, my dear third bundle, I will hug thee to\nmy bosom. And I beg you'll say nothing of all this till I am gone, that\nmy master mayn't be so angry, but that I may go in peace; for my heart,\nwithout other matters, will be ready to break to part with you all.\n\nNow, Mrs. Jervis, said I, as to one matter more: and that is my master's\nlast usage of me, before Mr. Longman.--Said she, Pr'ythee, dear Pamela,\nstep to my chamber, and fetch me a paper I left on my table. I have\nsomething to shew you in it. I will, said I, and stepped down; but that\nwas only a fetch, to take the orders of my master, I found. It seems he\nsaid, he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me; but he\ncould not stand it, and wished I might not know he was there. But I\ntripped up again so nimbly, (for there was no paper,) that I just saw\nhis back, as if coming out of that green-room, and going into the next\nto it, the first door that was open--I whipped in, and shut the door,\nand bolted it. O Mrs. Jervis! said I, what have you done by me?--I see\nI can't confide in any body. I am beset on all hands. Wretched, wretched\nPamela, where shalt thou expect a friend, if Mrs. Jervis joins to betray\nthee thus? She made so many protestations, (telling me all, and that\nhe owned I had made him wipe his eyes two or three times, and said she\nhoped it would have a good effect, and remembered me, that I had said\nnothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment,) that\nI forgave her. But O! that I was safe from this house! for never\npoor creature sure was so flustered as I have been so many months\ntogether;--I am called down from this most tedious scribble. I wonder\nwhat will next befall Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nMrs. Jervis says, she is sure I shall have the chariot to carry me home\nto you. Though this will look too great for me, yet it will shew as if\nI was not turned away quite in disgrace. The travelling chariot is come\nfrom Lincolnshire, and I fancy I shall go in that; for the other is\nquite grand.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXX\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI write again, though, may be, I shall bring it to you in my pocket: for\nI shall have no writing, nor writing-time, I hope, when I come to you.\nThis is Wednesday morning, and I shall, I hope, set out to you to-morrow\nmorning; but I have had more trials and more vexations; but of another\ncomplexion too a little, though all from the same quarter.\n\nYesterday my master, after he came from hunting, sent for me. I went\nwith great terror: for I expected he would storm, and be in a fine\npassion with me for my freedom of speech before: so I was resolved to\nbegin first, with submission, to disarm his anger; and I fell upon my\nknees as soon as I saw him; and said, Good sir, let me beseech you, as\nyou hope to be forgiven yourself, and for the sake of my dear good lady\nyour mother, who recommended me to you with her last words, to forgive\nme all my faults; and only grant me this favour, the last I shall ask\nyou, that you will let me depart your house with peace and quietness of\nmind, that I may take such a leave of my dear fellow-servants as befits\nme; and that my heart be not quite broken.\n\nHe took me up, in a kinder manner than ever I had known; and he said,\nShut the door, Pamela, and come to me in my closet: I want to have a\nlittle serious talk with you. How can I, sir, said I, how can I! and\nwrung my hands. O pray, sir, let me go out of your presence, I beseech\nyou! By the God that made me, said he, I'll do you no harm. Shut the\nparlour door, and come to me in my library.\n\nHe then went into his closet, which is his library, and full of rich\npictures besides; a noble apartment, though called a closet, and next\nthe private garden, into which it has a door that opens. I shut the\nparlour door, as he bid me; but stood at it irresolute. Place some\nconfidence in me, said he: Surely you may, when I have spoken thus\nsolemnly. So I crept towards him with trembling feet, and my heart\nthrobbing through my handkerchief. Come in, said he, when I bid you. I\ndid so. Pray, sir, said I, pity and spare me. I will, said he, as I hope\nto be saved. He sat down upon a rich settee; and took hold of my hand,\nand said, Don't doubt me, Pamela. From this moment I will no more\nconsider you as my servant: and I desire you'll not use me with\ningratitude for the kindness I am going to express towards you. This a\nlittle emboldened me; and he said, holding both my hands between his,\nYou have too much wit and good sense not to discover, that I, in spite\nof my heart, and all the pride of it, cannot but love you. Yes, look\nup to me, my sweet-faced girl! I must say I love you; and have put on a\nbehaviour to you, that was much against my heart, in hopes to frighten\nyou from your reservedness. You see I own it ingenuously; and don't play\nyour sex upon me for it.\n\nI was unable to speak; and he, seeing me too much oppressed with\nconfusion to go on in that strain, said, Well, Pamela, let me know in\nwhat situation of life is your father: I know he is a poor man; but is\nhe as low and as honest as he was when my mother took you?\n\nThen I could speak a little; and with a down look, (and I felt my face\nglow like fire,) I said, Yes, sir, as poor and as honest too; and that\nis my pride. Says he, I will do something for him, if it be not your\nfault, and make all your family happy. All, sir, said I, he is happier\nalready than ever he can be, if his daughter's innocence is to be the\nprice of your favour: and I beg you will not speak to me on the only\nside that can wound me. I have no design of that sort, said he. O sir,\nsaid I, tell me not so, tell me not so!--'Tis easy, said he, for me to\nbe the making of your father, without injuring you. Well, sir, said I,\nif this can be done, let me know how; and all I can do with innocence\nshall be the study and practice of my life.--But, O! what can such a\npoor creature as I do, and do my duty?--Said he, I would have you stay a\nweek or fortnight only, and behave yourself with kindness to me; I\nstoop to beg it of you, and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your\nexpectation. I see, said he, you are going to answer otherwise than I\nwould have you; and I begin to be vexed I should thus meanly sue; and so\nI will say, that your behaviour before honest Longman, when I used you\nas I did, and you could so well have vindicated yourself, has quite\ncharmed me. And though I am not pleased with all you said yesterday,\nwhile I was in the closet, yet you have moved me more to admire you than\nbefore; and I am awakened to see more worthiness in you, than ever I\nsaw in any lady in the world. All the servants, from the highest to the\nlowest, doat upon you, instead of envying you; and look upon you in so\nsuperior a light, as speaks what you ought to be. I have seen more\nof your letters than you imagine, (This surprised me!) and am quite\novercome with your charming manner of writing, so free, so easy, and\nmany of your sentiments so much above your years, and your sex; and all\nput together, makes me, as I tell you, love you to extravagance. Now,\nPamela, when I have stooped to acknowledge all this, oblige me only\nto stay another week or fortnight, to give me time to bring about some\ncertain affairs, and you shall see how much you may find your account in\nit.\n\nI trembled to find my poor heart giving way.--O good sir, said I, spare\na poor girl that cannot look up to you, and speak. My heart is full;\nand why should you wish to undo me?--Only oblige me, said he, to stay a\nfortnight longer, and John shall carry word to your father, that I will\nsee him in the time, either here, or at the Swan in his village. O sir,\nsaid I, my heart will burst; but, on my bended knees, I beg you to\nlet me go to-morrow, as I designed: and don't offer to tempt a poor\ncreature, whose whole will would be to do yours, if my virtue would\npermit!--I shall permit it, said he; for I intend no injury to you, God\nis my witness! Impossible! said I; I cannot, sir, believe you, after\nwhat has passed: How many ways are there to undo poor creatures! Good\nGod, protect me this one time, and send me but to my dear father's\ncot in safety!--Strange, d----d fate! said he, that when I speak so\nsolemnly, I can't be believed!--What should I believe, sir? said I, what\ncan I believe? What have you said, but that I am to stay a fortnight\nlonger? and what then is to become of me?--My pride of birth and fortune\n(d--n them both! said he, since they cannot obtain credit with you, but\nmust add to your suspicions) will not let me descend all at once; and\nI ask you but a fortnight's stay, that, after this declaration, I may\npacify those proud demands upon me.\n\nO how my heart throbbed! and I began (for I did not know what I did) to\nsay the Lord's prayer. None of your beads to me Pamela! said he; thou\nart a perfect nun, I think.\n\nBut I said aloud, with my eyes lifted up to heaven, Lead me not into\ntemptation: but deliver me from evil, O my good God! He hugged me in his\narms, and said, Well, my dear girl, then you stay this fortnight, and\nyou shall see what I will do for you--I'll leave you a moment, and walk\ninto the next room, to give you time to think of it, and to shew you I\nhave no design upon you. Well, this, I thought, did not look amiss.\n\nHe went out, and I was tortured with twenty different doubts in a\nminute; sometimes I thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in\nthis house to obey him, while Mrs. Jervis was with me, could do no great\nharm: But then, thought I, how do I know what I may be able to do? I\nhave withstood his anger; but may I not relent at his kindness?--How\nshall I stand that.--Well, I hope, thought I, by the same protecting\ngrace in which I will always confide!--But, then, what has he promised?\nWhy, he will make my poor father and mother's life comfortable. O! said\nI to myself, that is a rich thought; but let me not dwell upon it, for\nfear I should indulge it to my ruin.--What can he do for me, poor girl\nas I am!--What can his greatness stoop to! He talks, thought I, of his\npride of heart, and pride of condition; O these are in his head, and in\nhis heart too, or he would not confess them to me at such an instant.\nWell then, thought I, this can be only to seduce me.--He has promised\nnothing.--But I am to see what he will do, if I stay a fortnight; and\nthis fortnight, thought I again, is no such great matter; and I shall\nsee in a few days how he carries it.--But then, when I again reflected\nupon this distance between him and me, and his now open declaration of\nlove, as he called it; and that after this he would talk with me on that\nsubject more plainly than ever, and I shall be less armed, may be,\nto withstand him; and then I bethought myself, why, if he meant no\ndishonour, he should not speak before Mrs. Jervis; and the odious\nfrightful closet came again into my head, and my narrow escape upon it;\nand how easy it might be for him to send Mrs. Jervis and the maids out\nof the way; and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought\nabout in less than that time; I resolved to go away and trust all to\nProvidence, and nothing to myself. And how ought I to be thankful for\nthis resolution!--as you shall hear.\n\nBut just as I have writ to this place, John sends me word, that he is\ngoing this minute your way; and so I will send you so far as I have\nwritten, and hope by to-morrow night, to ask your blessings, at your own\npoor, but happy abode, and tell you the rest by word of mouth; and so I\nrest, till then, and for ever, Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXI\n\n\nDEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI will continue my writing still, because, may be, I shall like to\nread it, when I am with you, to see what dangers I have been enabled to\nescape; and though I bring it along with me.\n\nI told you my resolution, my happy resolution as I have reason to think\nit: and just then he came in again, with great kindness in his looks,\nand said, I make no doubt, Pamela, you will stay this fortnight to\noblige me. I knew not how to frame my words so as to deny, and yet not\nmake him storm. But, said I, Forgive, sir, your poor distressed servant.\nI know I cannot possibly deserve any favour at your hands, consistent\nwith virtue; and I beg you will let me go to my poor father. Why, said\nhe, thou art the veriest fool that I ever knew. I tell you I will\nsee your father; I'll send for him hither to-morrow, in my travelling\nchariot, if you will; and I'll let him know what I intend to do for\nhim and you. What, sir, may I ask you, can that be? Your honour's noble\nestate may easily make him happy, and not unuseful, perhaps to you, in\nsome respect or other. But what price am I to pay for all this?--You\nshall be happy as you can wish, said he, I do assure you: And here I\nwill now give you this purse, in which are fifty guineas, which I will\nallow your father yearly, and find an employ suitable to his liking, to\ndeserve that and more: Pamela, he shall never want, depend upon it.\nI would have given you still more for him, but that, perhaps, you'd\nsuspect I intended it as a design upon you.--O sir, said I, take back\nyour guineas! I will not touch one, nor will my father, I am sure, till\nhe knows what is to be done for them; and particularly what is to become\nof me. Why then, Pamela, said he, suppose I find a man of probity,\nand genteel calling, for a husband for you, that shall make you a\ngentlewoman as long as you live?--I want no husband, sir, said I: for\nnow I began to see him in all his black colours!--Yet being so much in\nhis power, I thought I would a little dissemble. But, said he, you\nare so pretty, that go where you will, you can never be free from the\ndesigns of some or other of our sex; and I shall think I don't answer\nthe care of my dying mother for you, who committed you to me, if I don't\nprovide you a husband to protect your virtue, and your innocence; and a\nworthy one I have thought of for you.\n\nO black, perfidious creature! thought I, what an implement art thou\nin the hands of Lucifer, to ruin the innocent heart!--Yet still I\ndissembled: for I feared much both him and the place I was in. But,\nwhom, pray sir, have you thought of?--Why, said he, young Mr. Williams,\nmy chaplain, in Lincolnshire, who will make you happy. Does he know,\nsir, said I, any thing of your honour's intentions?--No, my girl, said\nhe, and kissed me, (much against my will; for his very breath was now\npoison to me,) but his dependance upon my favour, and your beauty and\nmerit, will make him rejoice at my kindness to him. Well, sir, said I,\nthen it is time enough to consider of this matter; and it cannot hinder\nme from going to my father's: for what will staying a fortnight longer\nsignify to this? Your honour's care and goodness may extend to me there,\nas well as here; and Mr. Williams, and all the world, shall know that I\nam not ashamed of my father's poverty.\n\nHe would kiss me again, and I said, If I am to think of Mr. Williams, or\nany body, I beg you'll not be so free with me: that is not pretty, I'm\nsure. Well, said he, but you stay this next fortnight, and in that time\nI'll have both Williams and your father here; for I will have the match\nconcluded in my house; and when I have brought it on, you shall settle\nit as you please together. Meantime take and send only these fifty\npieces to your father, as an earnest of my favour, and I'll make you\nall happy.--Sir, said I, I beg at least two hours to consider of this.\nI shall, said he, be gone out in one hour; and I would have you write to\nyour father what I propose; and John shall carry it on purpose: and he\nshall take the purse with him for the good old man, if you approve it.\nSir, said I, I will then let you know in one hour my resolution. Do so,\nsaid he; and gave me another kiss, and let me go.\n\nO how I rejoiced I had got out of his clutches!--So I write you this,\nthat you may see how matters stand; for I am resolved to come away, if\npossible. Base, wicked, treacherous gentleman as he is!\n\nSo here was a trap laid for your poor Pamela! I tremble to think of\nit! O what a scene of wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched\nlife! Black-hearted wretch! how I hate him!--For, at first, as you'll\nsee by what I have written, he would have made me believe other things;\nand this of Mr. Williams, I suppose, came into his head after he walked\nout from his closet, to give himself time to think how to delude me\nbetter: but the covering was now too thin, and easy to be seen through.\n\nI went to my chamber, and the first thing I did was to write to him; for\nI thought it was best not to see him again, if I could help it; and I\nput it under his parlour door, after I had copied it, as follows:\n\n'HONOURED SIR,\n\n'Your last proposal to me convinces me, that I ought not to stay, but\nto go to my father, if it were but to ask his advice about Mr. Williams.\nAnd I am so set upon it, that I am not to be persuaded. So, honoured\nsir, with a thousand thanks for all favours, I will set out to-morrow\nearly; and the honour you designed me, as Mrs. Jervis tells me, of your\nchariot, there will be no occasion for: because I can hire, I believe,\nfarmer Brady's chaise. So, begging you will not take it amiss, I shall\never be 'Your dutiful Servant.'\n\n'As to the purse, sir, my poor father, to be sure, won't forgive me, if\nI take it, till he can know how to deserve it which is impossible.'\n\nSo he has just now sent Mrs. Jervis to tell me, that since I am resolved\nto go, go I may, and the travelling chariot shall be ready; but it shall\nbe worse for me; for that he will never trouble himself about me as long\nas he lives. Well, so I get out of the house, I care not; only I should\nhave been glad I could, with innocence, have made you, my dear parents,\nhappy.\n\nI cannot imagine the reason of it, but John, who I thought was gone with\nmy last, is but now going; and he sends to know if I have any thing else\nto carry. So I break off to send you this with the former.\n\nI am now preparing for my journey, and about taking leave of my good\nfellow-servants: and if I have not time to write, I must tell you the\nrest, when I am so happy as to be with you.\n\nOne word more: I slip in a paper of verses, on my going: sad poor stuff!\nbut as they come from me, you'll not dislike them, may be. I shewed them\nto Mrs. Jervis, and she liked them, and took a copy; and made one sing\nthem to her, and in the green-room too; but I looked into the closet\nfirst. I will only add, that I am Your dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\nLet me just say, That he has this moment sent me five guineas by Mrs.\nJervis, as a present for my pocket: So I shall be very rich; for as she\nbrought them, I thought I might take them. He says he won't see me: and\nI may go when I will in the morning; and Lincolnshire Robin shall drive\nme: but he is so angry, he orders that nobody shall go out at the door\nwith me, not so much as into the coach-yard. Well! I can't help it, not\nI! But does not this expose himself more than me?\n\nBut John waits, and I would have brought this and the other myself; but\nhe says, he has put it up among other things, and so can take both as\nwell as one.\n\nJohn is very good, and very honest; I am under great obligations to him.\nI'd give him a guinea, now I'm so rich, if I thought he'd take it. I\nhear nothing of my lady's clothes, and those my master gave me: for I\ntold Mrs. Jervis, I would not take them; but I fancy, by a word or two\nthat was dropped, they will be sent after me. Dear sirs! what a rich\nPamela you'll have if they should! But as I can't wear them if they do,\nI don't desire them; and if I have them, will turn them into money, as I\ncan have opportunity. Well, no more--I'm in a fearful hurry!\n\n  VERSES ON MY GOING AWAY.\n\n             I.\n\n  My fellow-servants dear, attend\n  To these few lines, which I have penn'd:\n  I'm sure they're from your honest friend,\n  And wisher-well, poor PAMELA.\n\n            II.\n\n  I, from a state of low degree,\n  Was plac'd in this good family:\n  Too high a fate for humble me,\n  The helpless, hopeless PAMELA.\n\n           III.\n\n  Yet though my happy lot was so,\n  Joyful, I homeward from it go,\n  No less content, when poor and low,\n  Than here you find your PAMELA.\n\n            IV.\n\n  For what indeed is happiness,\n  But conscience innocence and peace?\n  And that's a treasure I possess;\n  Thank Heaven that gave it PAMELA.\n\n             V.\n\n  My future lot I cannot know\n  But this I'm sure, where'er I go,\n  Whate'er I am, whate'er I do,\n  I'll be the grateful PAMELA.\n\n            VI.\n\n  No sad regrets my heart annoy,\n  I'll pray for all your peace and joy,\n  From master high, to scullion boy,\n  For all your loves to PAMELA.\n\n           VII.\n\n  One thing or two I've more to say;\n  God's holy will, be sure, obey;\n  And for our master always pray,\n  As ever shall poor PAMELA.\n\n          VIII.\n\n  For, oh! we pity should the great,\n  Instead of envying their estate;\n  Temptations always on 'em wait,\n  Exempt from which are such as we.\n\n           IX.\n\n  Their riches, gay deceitful snares,\n  Enlarge their fears, increase their cares\n  Their servants' joy surpasses theirs;\n  At least so judges PAMELA.\n\n             X.\n\n  Your parents and relations love\n  Let them your duty ever prove;\n  And you'll be bless'd by Heav'n above,\n  As will, I hope, poor PAMELA.\n\n            XI.\n\n  For if asham'd I e'er could be\n  Of my dear parents' low degree,\n  What lot had been too mean for me,\n  Unbless'd, unvirtuous PAMELA.\n\n           XII.\n\n  Thrice happy may you ever be,\n  Each one in his and her degree;\n  And, sirs, whene'er you think of me,\n  Pray for content to PAMELA.\n\n          XIII.\n\n  Pray for her wish'd content and peace;\n  And rest assur'd she'll never cease,\n  To pray for all your joys increase,\n  While life is lent to PAMELA.\n\n           XIV.\n\n  On God all future good depends:\n  Serve him.  And so my sonnet ends,\n  With, thank ye, thank ye, honest friends,\n  For all your loves to PAMELA,\n\nHere it is necessary the reader should know, that the fair Pamela's\ntrials were not yet over; but the worst were to come, at a time when she\nthought them at an end, and that she was returning to her father: for\nwhen her master found her virtue was not to be subdued, and he had in\nvain tried to conquer his passion for her, being a gentleman of pleasure\nand intrigue, he had ordered his Lincolnshire coachman to bring his\ntravelling chariot from thence, not caring to trust his Bedfordshire\ncoachman, who, with the rest of the servants, so greatly loved and\nhonoured the fair damsel; and having given him instructions accordingly,\nand prohibited the other servants, on pretence of resenting Pamela's\nbehaviour, from accompanying her any part of the road, he drove her\nfive miles on the way to her father's; and then turning off, crossed the\ncountry, and carried her onwards toward his Lincolnshire estate.\n\nIt is also to be observed, that the messenger of her letters to her\nfather, who so often pretended business that way, was an implement in\nhis master's hands, and employed by him for that purpose; and always\ngave her letters first to him, and his master used to open and read\nthem, and then send them on; by which means, as he hints to her, (as she\nobserves in her letter XXX) he was no stranger to what she wrote. Thus\nevery way was the poor virgin beset: And the whole will shew the base\narts of designing men to gain their wicked ends; and how much it behoves\nthe fair sex to stand upon their guard against artful contrivances,\nespecially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low\nestate.\n\nA few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood.\nThe intriguing gentleman thought fit, however, to keep back from her\nfather her three last letters; in which she mentions his concealing\nhimself to hear her partitioning out her clothes, his last effort to\ninduce her to stay a fortnight, his pretended proposal of the chaplain,\nand her hopes of speedily seeing them, as also her verses; and to send\nhimself a letter to her father, which is as follows:\n\n'GOODMAN ANDREWS,\n\n'You will wonder to receive a letter from me. But I think I am obliged\nto let you know, that I have discovered the strange correspondence\ncarried on between you and your daughter, so injurious to my honour and\nreputation, and which, I think, you should not have encouraged, till you\nknew there were sufficient grounds for those aspersions, which she so\nplentifully casts upon me. Something possibly there might be in what she\nhas written from time to time; but, believe me, with all her pretended\nsimplicity and innocence, I never knew so much romantic invention as she\nis mistress of. In short, the girl's head's turned by romances, and\nsuch idle stuff, to which she has given herself up, ever since her\nkind lady's death. And she assumes airs, as if she was a mirror of\nperfection, and every body had a design upon her.\n\n'Don't mistake me, however; I believe her very honest, and very\nvirtuous; but I have found out also, that she is carrying on a sort of\ncorrespondence, or love affair, with a young clergyman, that I hope\nin time to provide for; but who, at present, is destitute of any\nsubsistence but my favour: And what would be the consequence, can you\nthink, of two young folks, who have nothing in the world to trust to of\ntheir own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before\nthey have bread to eat.\n\n'For my part, I have too much kindness to them both, not to endeavour to\nprevent it, if I can; and for this reason I have sent her out of his way\nfor a little while, till I can bring them both to better consideration;\nand I would not, therefore, have you be surprised you don't see your\ndaughter so soon as you might possibly expect.\n\n'Yet I do assure you, upon my honour, that she shall be safe and\ninviolate; and I hope you don't doubt me, notwithstanding any airs she\nmay have given herself, upon my jocular pleasantry to her, and perhaps\na little innocent romping with her, so usual with young folks of the two\nsexes, when they have been long acquainted, and grown up together; for\npride is not my talent.\n\n'As she is a mighty letter-writer, I hope she has had the duty to\napprise you of her intrigue with the young clergyman; and I know not\nwhether it meets with your countenance: But now she is absent for a\nlittle while, (for I know he would have followed her to your village,\nif she had gone home; and there, perhaps, they would have ruined\none another, by marrying,) I doubt not I shall bring him to see his\ninterest, and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a\nwife: And when that can be done, let them come together in God's name,\nfor me.\n\n'I expect not to be answered on this head, but by your good opinion, and\nthe confidence you may repose in my honour: being\n\n                                   'Your hearty friend to serve you.'\n\n'P. S. I find my man John has been the manager of the correspondence, in\nwhich such liberties have been taken with me. I shall soon, in a manner\nthat becomes me, let the saucy fellow know how much I resent his part\nof the affair. It is hard thing, that a man of my character in the world\nshould be used thus freely by his own servants.'\n\nIt is easy to guess at the poor old man's concern, upon reading this\nletter from a gentleman of so much consideration. He knew not what\ncourse to take, and had no manner of doubt of his poor daughter's\ninnocence, and that foul play was designed her. Yet he sometimes hoped\nthe best, and was ready to believe the surmised correspondence between\nthe clergyman and her, having not received the letters she wrote, which\nwould have cleared up that affair.\n\nBut, after all, he resolved, as well to quiet his own as her mother's\nuneasiness, to undertake a journey to the 'squire's; and leaving his\npoor wife to excuse him to the farmer who employed him, he set out that\nvery evening, late as it was; and travelling all night, found himself,\nsoon after day-light, at the gate of the gentleman, before the family\nwas up: and there he sat down to rest himself till he should see\nsomebody stirring.\n\nThe grooms were the first he saw, coming out to water their horses; and\nhe asked, in so distressful a manner, what was become of Pamela, that\nthey thought him crazy: and said, Why, what have you to do with Pamela,\nold fellow? Get out of the horses' way.--Where is your master? said the\npoor man: Pray, gentlemen, don't be angry: my heart's almost broken.--He\nnever gives any thing at the door, I assure you, says one of the grooms;\nso you lose your labour. I am not a beggar yet, said the poor old man; I\nwant nothing of him, but my Pamela:--O my child! my child!\n\nI'll be hanged, says one of them, if this is not Mrs. Pamela's\nfather.--Indeed, indeed, said he, wringing his hands, I am; and weeping,\nWhere is my child? Where is my Pamela?--Why, father, said one of them,\nwe beg your pardon; but she is gone home to you: How long have you been\ncome from home?--O! but last night, said he; I have travelled all night:\nIs the 'squire at home, or is he not?--Yes, but he is not stirring\nthough, said the groom, as yet. Thank God for that! said he; thank God\nfor that! Then I hope I may be permitted to speak to him anon. They\nasked him to go in, and he stepped into the stable, and sat down on the\nstairs there, wiping his eyes, and sighing so sadly, that it grieved the\nservants to hear him.\n\nThe family was soon raised with a report of Pamela's father coming to\ninquire after his daughter; and the maids would fain have had him go\ninto the kitchen. But Mrs. Jervis, having been told of his coming,\narose, and hastened down to her parlour, and took him in with her, and\nthere heard all his sad story, and read the letter. She wept bitterly,\nbut yet endeavoured, before him, to hide her concern; and said, Well,\nGoodman Andrews, I cannot help weeping at your grief; but I hope there\nis no occasion. Let nobody see this letter, whatever you do. I dare say\nyour daughter is safe.\n\nWell, but, said he, I see you, madam, know nothing about her:--If all\nwas right, so good a gentlewoman as you are, would not have been a\nstranger to this. To be sure you thought she was with me!\n\nSaid she, My master does not always inform his servants of his\nproceedings; but you need not doubt his honour. You have his hand for\nit: And you may see he can have no design upon her, because he is not\nfrom hence, and does not talk of going hence. O that is all I have to\nhope for! said he; that is all, indeed!--But, said he--and was going on,\nwhen the report of his coming had reached the 'squire, who came down,\nin his morning-gown and slippers, into the parlour, where he and Mrs.\nJervis were talking.\n\nWhat's the matter, Goodman Andrews? said he, what's the matter? Oh my\nchild! said the good old man, give me my child! I beseech you.--Why, I\nthought, says the 'squire, that I had satisfied you about her: Sure you\nhave not the letter I sent you, written with my own hand. Yes, yes, but\nI have, sir, said he; and that brought me hither; and I have walked all\nnight. Poor man, returned he, with great seeming compassion, I am sorry\nfor it truly! Why, your daughter has made a strange racket in my family;\nand if I thought it would have disturbed you so much, I would have e'en\nlet her go home; but what I did was to serve her, and you too. She is\nvery safe, I do assure you, Goodman Andrews; and you may take my honour\nfor it, I would not injure her for the world. Do you think I would, Mrs.\nJervis? No, I hope not, sir, said she.--Hope not! said the poor man; so\ndo I; but pray, sir, give me my child, that is all I desire; and I'll\ntake care no clergyman shall come near her.\n\nWhy, London is a great way off, said the 'squire, and I can't send for\nher back presently. What, then, said he, have you sent my poor Pamela to\nLondon? I would not have said it so, replied the 'squire; but I assure\nyou, upon my honour, she is quite safe and satisfied, and will quickly\ninform you of it by letter. She is in a reputable family, no less than a\nbishop's, and is to wait on his lady, till I get the matter over that I\nmentioned to you.\n\nO how shall I know this? replied he.--What, said the 'squire, pretending\nanger, am I to be doubted?--Do you believe I can have any view upon your\ndaughter? And if I had, do you think I would take such methods as these\nto effect it? Why, surely, man, thou forgettest whom thou talkest to.\nO, sir, said he, I beg your pardon! but consider my dear child is in\nthe case; let me but know what bishop, and where; and I will travel to\nLondon on foot, to see my daughter, and then be satisfied.\n\nWhy, Goodman Andrews, I think thou hast read romances as well as thy\ndaughter, and thy head's turned with them. May I have not my word taken?\nDo you think, once more, I would offer any thing dishonourable to your\ndaughter? Is there any thing looks like it?--Pr'ythee, man, recollect a\nlittle who I am; and if I am not to be believed, what signifies talking?\nWhy, sir, said he, pray forgive me; but there is no harm to say, What\nbishop's, or whereabouts? What, and so you'd go troubling his lordship\nwith your impertinent fears and stories! Will you be satisfied, if you\nhave a letter from her within a week, it may be less, if she be not\nnegligent, to assure you all is well with her! Why that, said the poor\nman, will be some comfort. Well then, said the gentleman, I can't answer\nfor her negligence, if she don't write: And if she should send a letter\nto you, Mrs. Jervis, (for I desire not to see it; I have had trouble\nenough about her already,) be sure you send it by a man and horse the\nmoment you receive it. To be sure I will, answered she. Thank your\nhonour, said the good man: And then I must wait with as much patience as\nI can for a week, which will be a year to me.\n\nI tell you, said the gentleman, it must be her own fault if she don't\nwrite; for 'tis what I insisted upon, for my own reputation; and I\nshan't stir from this house, I assure you, till she is heard from, and\nthat to your satisfaction. God bless your honour, said the poor man, as\nyou say and mean truth! Amen, Amen, Goodman Andrews, said he: you see I\nam not afraid to say Amen. So, Mrs. Jervis, make the good man as welcome\nas you can; and let me have no uproar about the matter.\n\nHe then, whispering her, bid her give him a couple of guineas to bear\nhis charges home; telling him, he should be welcome to stay there\ntill the letter came, if he would, and be a witness, that he intended\nhonourably, and not to stir from his house for one while.\n\nThe poor old man staid and dined with Mrs. Jervis, with some tolerable\nease of mind, in hopes to hear from his beloved daughter in a few days;\nand then accepting the present, returned for his own house, and resolved\nto be as patient as possible.\n\nMeantime Mrs. Jervis, and all the family, were in the utmost grief for\nthe trick put upon the poor Pamela; and she and the steward represented\nit to their master in as moving terms as they durst; but were forced\nto rest satisfied with his general assurances of intending her no harm;\nwhich, however, Mrs. Jervis little believed, from the pretence he had\nmade in his letter, of the correspondence between Pamela and the young\nparson; which she knew to be all mere invention, though she durst not\nsay so.\n\nBut the week after, they were made a little more easy by the following\nletter brought by an unknown hand, and left for Mrs. Jervis, which, how\nprocured, will be shewn in the sequel.\n\n'DEAR MRS. JERVIS,\n\n'I have been vilely tricked, and, instead of being driven by Robin to\nmy dear father's, I am carried off, to where, I have no liberty to tell.\nHowever, I am at present not used hardly, in the main; and write to beg\nof you to let my dear father and mother (whose hearts must be well nigh\nbroken) know that I am well, and that I am, and, by the grace of God,\never will he, their honest, as well as dutiful daughter, and\n\n                                  'Your obliged friend,\n                                                 'PAMELA ANDREWS.'\n\n'I must neither send date nor place; but have most solemn assurances\nof honourable usage. This is the only time my low estate has been\ntroublesome to me, since it has subjected me to the frights I have\nundergone. Love to your good self, and all my dear fellow-servants.\nAdieu! adieu! but pray for poor PAMELA.'\n\nThis, though it quieted not entirely their apprehensions, was shewn to\nthe whole family, and to the gentleman himself, who pretended not to\nknow how it came; and Mrs. Jervis sent it away to the good old folks;\nwho at first suspected it was forged, and not their daughter's hand;\nbut, finding the contrary, they were a little easier to hear she was\nalive and honest: and having inquired of all their acquaintance what\ncould be done, and no one being able to put them in a way how to\nproceed, with effect, on so extraordinary an occasion, against so rich\nand so resolute a gentleman; and being afraid to make matters worse,\n(though they saw plainly enough, that she was in no bishop's family,\nand so mistrusted all the rest of his story,) they applied themselves\nto prayers for their poor daughter, and for an happy issue to an affair\nthat almost distracted them.\n\nWe shall now leave the honest old pair praying for their dear Pamela,\nand return to the account she herself gives of all this; having written\nit journal-wise, to amuse and employ her time, in hopes some opportunity\nmight offer to send it to her friends; and, as was her constant view,\nthat she might afterwards thankfully look back upon the dangers she had\nescaped, when they should be happily overblown, as in time she hoped\nthey would be; and that then she might examine, and either approve or\nrepent of her own conduct in them.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXII\n\n\nO MY DEAREST FATHER AND MOTHER!\n\nLet me write, and bewail my miserable hard fate, though I have no hope\nhow what I write can be conveyed to your hands!--I have now nothing to\ndo, but write and weep, and fear and pray! But yet what can I hope for,\nwhen I seem to be devoted, as a victim to the will of a wicked violator\nof all the laws of God and man!--But, gracious Heaven, forgive me my\nrashness and despondency! O let me not sin against thee; for thou best\nknowest what is fittest for thy poor handmaid!--And as thou sufferest\nnot thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear, I will\nresign myself to thy good pleasure: And still, I hope, desperate as my\ncondition seems, that as these trials are not of my own seeking, nor\nthe effects of my presumption and vanity, I shall be enabled to overcome\nthem, and, in God's own good time, be delivered from them.\n\nThus do I pray imperfectly, as I am forced by my distracting fears and\napprehensions; and O join with me, my dear parents!--But, alas! how can\nyou know, how can I reveal to you, the dreadful situation of your poor\ndaughter! The unhappy Pamela may be undone (which God forbid, and sooner\ndeprive me of life!) before you can know her hard lot!\n\nO the unparalleled wickedness, stratagems, and devices, of those who\ncall themselves gentlemen, yet pervert the design of Providence, in\ngiving them ample means to do good, to their own everlasting perdition,\nand the ruin of poor oppressed innocence!\n\nBut now I will tell you what has befallen me; and yet, how shall you\nreceive it? Here is no honest John to carry my letters to you! And,\nbesides, I am watched in all my steps; and no doubt shall be, till my\nhard fate may ripen his wicked projects for my ruin. I will every day,\nhowever, write my sad state; and some way, perhaps, may be opened to\nsend the melancholy scribble to you. But, alas! when you know it, what\nwill it do but aggravate your troubles? For, O! what can the abject poor\ndo against the mighty rich, when they are determined to oppress?\n\nWell, but I must proceed to write what I had hoped to tell you in a few\nhours, when I believed I should receive your grateful blessings, on my\nreturn to you from so many hardships.\n\nI will begin with my account from the last letter I wrote you, in which\nI enclosed my poor stuff of verses; and continue it at times, as I have\nopportunity; though, as I said, I know not how it can reach you.\n\nThe long-hoped for Thursday morning came, when I was to set out. I had\ntaken my leave of my fellow-servants overnight; and a mournful leave\nit was to us all: for men, as well as women servants, wept much to\npart with me; and, for my part, I was overwhelmed with tears, and the\naffecting instances of their esteem. They all would have made me little\npresents, as tokens of their love; but I would not take any thing from\nthe lower servants, to be sure. But Mr. Longman would have me accept of\nseveral yards of Holland, and a silver snuff-box, and a gold ring, which\nhe desired me to keep for his sake; and he wept over me; but said, I am\nsure so good a maiden God will bless; and though you return to your\npoor father again, and his low estate, yet Providence will find you out:\nRemember I tell you so; and one day, though I mayn't live to see it, you\nwill be rewarded.\n\nI said, O, dear Mr. Longman! you make me too rich, and too mody; and\nyet I must be a beggar before my time for I shall want often to be\nscribbling, (little thinking it would be my only employment so soon,)\nand I will beg you, sir, to favour me with some paper; and, as soon as I\nget home, I will write you a letter, to thank you for all your kindness\nto me; and a letter to good Mrs. Jervis too.\n\nThis was lucky; for I should have had none else, but at the pleasure of\nmy rough-natured governess, as I may call her; but now I can write to\nease my mind, though I can't send it to you; and write what I please,\nfor she knows not how well I am provided: for good Mr. Longman gave me\nabove forty sheets of paper, and a dozen pens, and a little phial of\nink; which last I wrapped in paper, and put in my pocket; and some wax\nand wafers.\n\nO dear sir, said I, you have set me up. How shall I requite you? He\nsaid, By a kiss, my fair mistress: And I gave it very willingly; for he\nis a good old man.\n\nRachel and Hannah cried sadly, when I took my leave; and Jane, who\nsometimes used to be a little crossish, and Cicely too, wept sadly, and\nsaid, they would pray for me; but poor Jane, I doubt, will forget that;\nfor she seldom says her prayers for herself: More's the pity!\n\nThen Arthur the gardener, our Robin the coachman, and Lincolnshire Robin\ntoo, who was to carry me, were very civil; and both had tears in their\neyes; which I thought then very good-natured in Lincolnshire Robin,\nbecause he knew but little of me.--But since, I find he might well be\nconcerned; for he had then his instructions, it seems, and knew how he\nwas to be a means to entrap me.\n\nThen our other three footmen, Harry, Isaac, and Benjamin, and grooms,\nand helpers, were very much affected likewise; and the poor little\nscullion-boy, Tommy, was ready to run over for grief.\n\nThey had got all together over-night, expecting to be differently\nemployed in the morning; and they all begged to shake hands with me, and\nI kissed the maidens, and prayed to God to bless them all; and thanked\nthem for all their love and kindness to me: and, indeed, I was forced to\nleave them sooner than I would, because I could not stand it: Indeed\nI could not. Harry (I could not have thought it; for he is a little\nwildish, they say) cried till he sobbed again. John, poor honest John,\nwas not then come back from you. But as for the butler, Mr. Jonathan, he\ncould not stay in company.\n\nI thought to have told you a deal about this; but I have worse things to\nemploy my thoughts.\n\nMrs. Jervis, good Mrs. Jervis, cried all night long; and I comforted her\nall I could: And she made me promise, that if my master went to London\nto attend parliament, or to Lincolnshire, I would come and stay a week\nwith her: and she would have given me money; but I would not take it.\n\nWell, next morning came, and I wondered I saw nothing of poor honest\nJohn; for I waited to take leave of him, and thank him for all his\ncivilities to me and to you. But I suppose he was sent farther by my\nmaster, and so could not return; and I desired to be remembered to him.\n\nAnd when Mrs. Jervis told me, with a sad heart, the chariot was ready\nwith four horses to it, I was just upon sinking into the ground, though\nI wanted to be with you.\n\nMy master was above stairs, and never asked to see me. I was glad of it\nin the main; but he knew, false heart as he is, that I was not to be\nout of his reach.--O preserve me, Heaven, from his power, and from his\nwickedness!\n\nWell, they were not suffered to go with me one step, as I writ to you\nbefore; for he stood at the window to see me go. And in the passage to\nthe gate, out of his sight, there they stood all of them, in two rows;\nand we could say nothing on both sides, but God bless you! and God bless\nyou! But Harry carried my own bundle, my third bundle, as I was used to\ncall it, to the coach, with some plumb-cake, and diet-bread, made for me\nover-night, and some sweet-meats, and six bottles of Canary wine, which\nMrs. Jervis would make me take in a basket, to cheer our hearts now\nand then, when we got together, as she said. And I kissed all the maids\nagain, and shook hands with the men again: but Mr. Jonathan and Mr.\nLongman were not there; and then I tripped down the steps to the\nchariot, Mrs. Jervis crying most sadly.\n\nI looked up when I got to the chariot, and I saw my master at the\nwindow, in his gown; and I courtesied three times to him very low, and\nprayed for him with my hands lifted up; for I could not speak; indeed I\nwas not able: And he bowed his head to me, which made me then very glad\nhe would take such notice of me; and in I stepped, and was ready to\nburst with grief; and could only, till Robin began to drive, wave my\nwhite handkerchief to them, wet with my tears: and, at last, away he\ndrove, Jehu-like, as they say, out of the court-yard. And I too soon\nfound I had cause for greater and deeper grief.\n\nWell, said I to myself, at this rate I shall soon be with my dear father\nand mother; and till I had got, as I supposed, half-way, I thought of\nthe good friends I had left: And when, on stopping for a little bait\nto the horses, Robin told me I was near half-way, I thought it was high\ntime to wipe my eyes, and think to whom I was going; as then, alack for\nme! I thought. So I began to ponder what a meeting I should have with\nyou; how glad you'd both be to see me come safe and innocent to you,\nafter all my dangers: and so I began to comfort myself, and to banish\nthe other gloomy side from my mind; though, too, it returned now and\nthen; for I should be ungrateful not to love them for their love.\n\nWell, I believe I set out about eight o'clock in the morning; and I\nwondered and wondered, when it was about two, as I saw by a church dial,\nin a little village as we passed through, that I was still more and more\nout of my knowledge. Hey-day, thought I, to drive this strange pace, and\nto be so long a going a little more than twenty miles, is very odd! But\nto be sure, thought I, Robin knows the way.\n\nAt last he stopped, and looked about him, as if he was at a loss for the\nroad; and I said, Mr. Robert, sure you are out of the way!--I'm afraid I\nam, said he. But it can't be much; I'll ask the first person I see. Pray\ndo, said I; and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay: and I gave him\nsome cake, and two glasses of Canary wine; and stopt about half an hour\nin all. Then he drove on very fast again.\n\nI had so much to think of, of the dangers I now doubted not I had\nescaped, of the loving friends I had left, and my best friends I was\ngoing to; and the many things I had to relate to you; that I the less\nthought of the way, till I was startled out of my meditations by the sun\nbeginning to set, and still the man driving on, and his horses sweating\nand foaming; and then I began to be alarmed all at once, and called to\nhim; and he said he had horrid ill luck, for he had come several miles\nout of the way, but was now right, and should get in still before it was\nquite dark. My heart began then to misgive me a little, and I was very\nmuch fatigued; for I had no sleep for several nights before, to signify;\nand at last I said, Pray Mr. Robert, there is a town before us, what\ndo you call it?--If we are so much out of the way, we had better put up\nthere, for the night comes on apace: And, Lord protect me! thought I,\nI shall have new dangers, mayhap, to encounter with the man, who have\nescaped the master--little thinking of the base contrivance of the\nlatter.--Says he, I am just there: 'Tis but a mile on one side of the\ntown before us.--Nay, said I, I may be mistaken; for it is a good while\nsince I was this way; but I am sure the face of the country here is\nnothing like what I remember it.\n\nHe pretended to be much out of humour with himself for mistaking the\nway, and at last stopped at a farmhouse, about two miles beyond the\nvillage I had seen; and it was then almost dark, and he alighted, and\nsaid, We must make shift here; for I am quite out.\n\nLord, thought I, be good to the poor Pamela! More trials still!--What\nwill befall me next?\n\nThe farmer's wife, and maid, and daughter, came out; and the wife said,\nWhat brings you this way at this time of night, Mr. Robert? And with\na lady too?--Then I began to be frightened out of my wits; and laying\nmiddle and both ends together, I fell a crying, and said, God give me\npatience! I am undone for certain!--Pray, mistress, said I, do you know\n'Squire B----, of Bedfordshire?\n\nThe wicked coachman would have prevented the answering me; but the\nsimple daughter said, Know his worship! yes, surely! why he is my\nfather's landlord.--Well, said I, then I am undone; undone for ever!--O,\nwicked wretch! what have I done to you, said I to the coachman, to serve\nme thus?--Vile tool of a wicked master!--Faith, said the fellow, I am\nsorry this task was put upon me; but I could not help it. But make the\nbest of it now; here are very civil reputable folks; and you'll be safe\nhere, I'll assure you.--Let me get out, said I, and I'll walk back to\nthe town we came through, late as it is:--For I will not enter here.\n\nSaid the farmer's wife, You'll be very well used here, I'll assure you,\nyoung gentlewoman, and have better conveniences than any where in the\nvillage. I matter not conveniences, said I: I am betrayed and undone!\nAs you have a daughter of your own, pity me, and let me know if your\nlandlord, as you call him, be here!--No, I'll assure you he is not, said\nshe.\n\nAnd then came the farmer, a good-like sort of man, grave, and\nwell-behaved; and spoke to me in such sort, as made me a little\npacified; and seeing no help for it, I went in; and the wife immediately\nconducted me up stairs to the best apartment, and told me, that was mine\nas long as I staid: and nobody should come near me but when I called.\nI threw myself on the bed in the room, tired and frightened to death\nalmost; and gave way to the most excessive fit of grief that I ever had.\n\nThe daughter came up, and said, Mr. Robert had given her a letter to\ngive me; and there it was. I raised myself, and saw it was the hand\nand seal of the wicked wretch, my master, directed to Mrs. Pamela\nAndrews.--This was a little better than to have him here; though, if he\nhad, he must have been brought through the air; for I thought I was.\n\nThe good woman (for I began to see things about a little reputable, and\nno guile appearing in them, but rather a face of grief for my grief)\noffered me a glass of some cordial water, which I accepted, for I\nwas ready to sink; and then I sat up in a chair a little, though very\nfaintish: and they brought me two candles, and lighted a brushwood fire;\nand said, if I called, I should be waited on instantly; and so left me\nto ruminate on my sad condition, and to read my letter, which I was not\nable to do presently. After I had a little come to myself, I found it to\ncontain these words:\n\n\n'DEAR PAMELA,\n\n'The passion I have for you, and your obstinacy, have constrained me to\nact by you in a manner that I know will occasion you great trouble and\nfatigue, both of mind and body. Yet, forgive me, my dear girl; for,\nalthough I have taken this step, I will, by all that's good and\nholy! use you honourably. Suffer not your fears to transport you to\na behaviour that will be disreputable to us both: for the place where\nyou'll receive this, is a farm that belongs to me; and the people civil,\nhonest, and obliging.\n\n'You will, by this time, be far on your way to the place I have allotted\nfor your abode for a few weeks, till I have managed some affairs, that\nwill make me shew myself to you in a much different light, than you may\npossibly apprehend from this rash action: And to convince you, that I\nmean no harm, I do assure you, that the house you are going to, shall be\nso much at your command, that even I myself will not approach it without\nleave from you. So make yourself easy; be discreet and prudent; and a\nhappier turn shall reward these your troubles, than you may at present\napprehend.\n\n'Meantime I pity the fatigue you will have, if this come to your hand in\nthe place I have directed: and will write to your father to satisfy him,\nthat nothing but what is honourable shall be offered to you, by\n\n               Your passionate admirer, (so I must style myself,)\n\n                                                     '---------------'\n\nDon't think hardly of poor Robin: You have so possessed all my servants\nin your favour, that I find they had rather serve you than me; and 'tis\nreluctantly the poor fellow undertook this task; and I was forced to\nsubmit to assure him of my honourable intentions to you, which I\nam fully resolved to make good, if you compel me not to a contrary\nconduct.'\n\n\nI but too well apprehended that the letter was only to pacify me for the\npresent; but as my danger was not so immediate as I had reason to dread,\nand he had promised to forbear coming to me, and to write to you, my\ndear parents, to quiet your concern, I was a little more easy than\nbefore and I made shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they had\ngot for me, and drank a glass of my sack, and made each of them do so\ntoo.\n\nBut after I had so done, I was again a little flustered; for in came\nthe coachman with the look of a hangman, I thought, and madamed me up\nstrangely; telling me, he would beg me to get ready to pursue my journey\nby five in the morning, or else he should be late in. I was quite\ngrieved at this; for I began not to dislike my company, considering how\nthings stood; and was in hopes to get a party among them, and so to put\nmyself into any worthy protection in the neighbourhood, rather than go\nforward.\n\nWhen he withdrew, I began to tamper with the farmer and his wife. But,\nalas! they had had a letter delivered them at the same time I had; so\nsecurely had Lucifer put it into his head to do his work; and they only\nshook their heads, and seemed to pity me; and so I was forced to give\nover that hope.\n\nHowever, the good farmer shewed me his letter; which I copied as\nfollows: for it discovers the deep arts of this wicked master; and how\nresolved he seems to be on my ruin, by the pains he took to deprive me\nof all hopes of freeing myself from his power.\n\n\n'FARMER NORTON,\n\n'I send to your house, for one night only, a young gentlewoman, much\nagainst her will, who has deeply embarked in a love affair, which\nwill be her ruin, as well as the person's to whom she wants to betroth\nherself. I have, to oblige her father, ordered her to be carried to one\nof my houses, where she will be well used, to try, if by absence, and\nexpostulation with both, they can be brought to know their own interest\nand I am sure you will use her kindly for my sake: for, excepting\nthis matter, which she will not own, she does not want prudence and\ndiscretion. I will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this\nmatter the first opportunity; and am\n\n                              'Your Friend and Servant.'\n\n\nHe had said, too cunningly for me, that I would not own this pretended\nlove affair; so that he had provided them not to believe me, say what I\nwould; and as they were his tenants, who all love him, (for he has some\namiable qualities, and so he had need!) I saw all my plot cut out, and\nso was forced to say the less.\n\nI wept bitterly, however; for I found he was too hard for me, as well in\nhis contrivances as riches; and so had recourse again to my only refuge,\ncomforting myself, that God never fails to take the innocent heart into\nhis protection, and is alone able to baffle and confound the devices of\nthe mighty. Nay, the farmer was so prepossessed with the contents of\nhis letter, that he began to praise his care and concern for me, and to\nadvise me against entertaining addresses without my friends' advice\nand consent; and made me the subject of a lesson for his daughter's\nimprovement. So I was glad to shut up this discourse; for I saw I was\nnot likely to be believed.\n\nI sent, however, to tell my driver, that I was so fatigued, I could not\nget out so soon the next morning. But he insisted upon it, and said,\nIt would make my day's journey the lighter; and I found he was a more\nfaithful servant to his master, notwithstanding what he wrote of his\nreluctance, than I could have wished: I saw still more and more, that\nall was deep dissimulation, and contrivance worse and worse.\n\nIndeed I might have shewn them his letter to me, as a full confutation\nof his to them; but I saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf:\nand so thought it signified little, as I was to go away so soon, to\nenter more particularly into the matter with them; and besides, I saw\nthey were not inclinable to let me stay longer, for fear of disobliging\nhim so I went to bed, but had very little rest: and they would make\ntheir servant-maid bear me company in the chariot five miles, early in\nthe morning, and she was to walk hack.\n\nI had contrived in my thoughts, when I was on my way in the chariot, on\nFriday morning, that when we came into some town to bait, as he must do\nfor the horses' sake, I would, at the inn, apply myself, if I saw I any\nway could, to the mistress of the inn, and tell her the case, and to\nrefuse to go farther, having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend\nwith.\n\nWell, I was very full of this project, and in great hopes, some how or\nother, to extricate myself in this way. But, oh! the artful wretch had\nprovided for even this last refuge of mine; for when we came to put up\nat a large town on the way, to eat a morsel for dinner, and I was fully\nresolved to execute my project, who should be at the inn that he put up\nat, but the wicked Mrs. Jewkes, expecting me! And her sister-in-law was\nthe mistress of it; and she had provided a little entertainment for me.\n\nAnd this I found, when I desired, as soon as I came in, to speak with\nthe mistress of the house. She came to me: and I said, I am a poor\nunhappy young body, that want your advice and assistance; and you seem\nto be a good sort of a gentlewoman, that would assist an oppressed\ninnocent person. Yes, madam, said she, I hope you guess right; and I\nhave the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak.\nPray call my sister Jewkes.--Jewkes! Jewkes! thought I; I have heard of\nthat name; I don't like it.\n\nThen the wicked creature appeared, whom I had never seen but once\nbefore, and I was terrified out of my wits. No stratagem, thought I, not\none! for a poor innocent girl; but every thing to turn out against me;\nthat is hard indeed!\n\nSo I began to pull in my horns, as they say, for I saw I was now worse\noff than at the farmer's.\n\nThe naughty woman came up to me with an air of confidence, and kissed\nme: See, sister, said she, here's a charming creature! Would she not\ntempt the best lord in the land to run away with her? O frightful!\nthought I; here's an avowal of the matter at once: I am now gone, that's\ncertain. And so was quite silent and confounded; and seeing no help for\nit, (for she would not part with me out of her sight) I was forced to\nset out with her in the chariot for she came thither on horseback, with\na man-servant, who rode by us the rest of the way, leading her horse:\nand now I gave over all thoughts of redemption, and was in a desponding\ncondition indeed.\n\nWell, thought I, here are strange pains taken to ruin a poor innocent,\nhelpless, and even worthless young body. This plot is laid too deep,\nand has been too long hatching, to be baffled, I fear. But then I put\nmy trust in God, who I knew was able to do every thing for me, when all\nother possible means should fail: and in him I was resolved to confide.\n\nYou may see--(Yet, oh! that kills me; for I know not whether ever you\ncan see what I now write or no--Else you will see)--what sort of woman\nthat Mrs. Jewkes is, compared to good Mrs. Jervis, by this:----\n\nEvery now and then she would be staring in my face, in the chariot, and\nsqueezing my hand, and saying, Why, you are very pretty, my silent dear!\nAnd once she offered to kiss me. But I said, I don't like this sort of\ncarriage, Mrs. Jewkes; it is not like two persons of one sex. She fell\na laughing very confidently, and said, That's prettily said, I vow! Then\nthou hadst rather be kissed by the other sex? 'I fackins, I commend thee\nfor that!\n\nI was sadly teased with her impertinence, and bold way; but no wonder;\nshe was innkeeper's housekeeper, before she came to my master; and those\nsort of creatures don't want confidence, you know: and indeed she made\nnothing to talk boldly on twenty occasions; and said two or three times,\nwhen she saw the tears every now and then, as we rid, trickle down my\ncheeks, I was sorely hurt, truly, to have the handsomest and finest\nyoung gentleman in five counties in love with me!\n\nSo I find I am got into the hands of a wicked procuress; and if I was\nnot safe with good Mrs. Jervis, and where every body loved me, what a\ndreadful prospect have I now before me, in the hands of a woman that\nseems to delight in filthiness!\n\nO dear sirs! what shall I do! What shall I do!--Surely, I shall never be\nequal to all these things!\n\nAbout eight at night, we entered the court-yard of this handsome, large,\nold, and lonely mansion, that looks made for solitude and mischief, as I\nthought, by its appearance, with all its brown nodding horrors of lofty\nelms and pines about it: and here, said I to myself, I fear, is to be\nthe scene of my ruin, unless God protect me, who is all-sufficient!\n\nI was very sick at entering it, partly from fatigue, and partly from\ndejection of spirits: and Mrs. Jewkes got me some mulled wine, and\nseemed mighty officious to welcome me thither; and while she was absent,\nordering the wine, the wicked Robin came in to me, and said, I beg a\nthousand pardons for my part in this affair, since I see your grief and\nyour distress; and I do assure you, that I am sorry it fell to my task.\n\nMighty well, Mr. Robert! said I; I never saw an execution but once, and\nthen the hangman asked the poor creature's pardon, and wiped his mouth,\nas you do, and pleaded his duty, and then calmly tucked up the criminal.\nBut I am no criminal, as you all know: And if I could have thought it\nmy duty to obey a wicked master in his unlawful command, I had saved you\nall the merit of this vile service.\n\nI am sorry, said he, you take it so: but every body don't think alike.\nWell, said I, you have done your part, Mr. Robert, towards my ruin, very\nfaithfully; and will have cause to be sorry, may be, at the long run,\nwhen you shall see the mischief that comes of it.--Your eyes were\nopen, and you knew I was to be carried to my father's, and that I was\nbarbarously tricked and betrayed; and I can only, once more, thank you\nfor your part of it. God forgive you!\n\nSo he went away a little sad. What have you said to Robin, madam? said\nMrs. Jewkes: (who came in as he went out:) the poor fellow's ready to\ncry. I need not be afraid of your following his example, Mrs. Jewkes,\nsaid I: I have been telling him, that he has done his part to my ruin:\nand he now can't help it! So his repentance does me no good; I wish it\nmay him. I'll assure you, madam, said she, I should be as ready to cry\nas he, if I should do you any harm. It is not in his power to help it\nnow, said I; but your part is to come, and you may choose whether you'll\ncontribute to my ruin or not.--Why, look ye, madam, said she, I have a\ngreat notion of doing my duty to my master; and therefore you may depend\nupon it, if I can do that, and serve you, I will: but you must think, if\nyour desire, and his will, come to clash once, I shall do as he bids me,\nlet it be what it will.\n\nPray, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, don't madam me so: I am but a silly poor\ngirl, set up by the gambol of fortune, for a May-game; and now am to be\nsomething, and now nothing, just as that thinks fit to sport with\nme: And let you and me talk upon a foot together; for I am a servant\ninferior to you, and so much the more, as I am turned out of place.\n\nAy, ay, says she, I understand something of the matter; you have so\ngreat power over my master, that you may soon be mistress of us all; and\nso I would oblige you, if I could. And I must and will call you madam;\nfor I am instructed to shew you all respect, I'll assure you.\n\nWho instructed you so to do? said I. Who! my master, to be sure, said\nshe. Why, said I, how can that be? You have not seen him lately. No,\nthat's true, said she; but I have been expecting you here some time; (O\nthe deep laid wickedness! thought I:) and, besides, I have a letter of\ninstructions by Robin; but, may be, I should not have said so much. If\nyou would shew them to me, said I, I should be able to judge how far I\ncould, or could not, expect favour from you, consistent with your duty\nto our master. I beg your pardon, fair mistress, for that, said she, I\nam sufficiently instructed; and you may depend upon it, I will observe\nmy orders; and, so far as they will let me, so far will I oblige you;\nand there's an end of it.\n\nWell, said I, you will not, I hope, do an unlawful or wicked thing, for\nany master in the world. Look ye, said she, he is my master; and if he\nbids me do any thing that I can do, I think I ought to do it; and let\nhim, who has his power to command me, look to the lawfulness of it.\nWhy, said I, suppose he should bid you cut my throat, Would you do it?\nThere's no danger of that, said she; but to be sure I would not; for\nthen I should be hanged! for that would be murder. Well, said I, and\nsuppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature, and ruin\nher, would you assist him in that? For to rob a person of her virtue is\nworse than cutting her throat.\n\nWhy now, says she, how strangely you talk! Are not the two sexes made\nfor one another? And is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty\nwoman? And suppose he can obtain his desires, is that so bad as cutting\nher throat? And then the wretch fell a laughing, and talked most\nimpertinently, and shewed me, that I had nothing to expect from her\nvirtue or conscience: and this gave me great mortification; for I was in\nhopes of working upon her by degrees.\n\nSo we ended our discourse here, and I bid her shew me where I must\nlie.--Why, said she, lie where you list, madam; I can tell you, I must\nlie with you for the present. For the present! said I, and torture then\nwrung my heart!--But is it in your instructions, that you must lie with\nme? Yes, indeed, said she.--I am sorry for it, said I. Why, said she,\nI am wholesome, and cleanly too, I'll assure you. Yes, said I, I don't\ndoubt that; but I love to lie by myself. How so? said she; Was not Mrs.\nJervis your bed-fellow at t'other house?\n\nWell, said I, quite sick of her, and my condition; you must do as you\nare instructed, I think. I can't help myself, and am a most miserable\ncreature. She repeated her insufferable nonsense. Mighty miserable,\nindeed, to be so well beloved by one of the finest gentlemen in England!\n\n\nI am now come down in my writing to this present SATURDAY, and a deal I\nhave written.\n\nMy wicked bed-fellow has very punctual orders, it seems; for she locks\nme and herself in, and ties the two keys (for there is a double door to\nthe room) about her wrist, when she goes to bed. She talks of the house\nhaving been attempted to be broken open two or three times; whether to\nfright me, I can't tell; but it makes me fearful; though not so much as\nI should be, if I had not other and greater fears.\n\nI slept but little last night, and got up, and pretended to sit by the\nwindow, which looks into the spacious gardens; but I was writing all\nthe time, from break of day, to her getting up, and after, when she was\nabsent.\n\nAt breakfast she presented the two maids to me, the cook and house-maid,\npoor awkward souls, that I can see no hopes of, they seem so devoted to\nher and ignorance. Yet I am resolved, if possible, to find some way to\nescape, before this wicked master comes.\n\nThere are, besides, of servants, the coachman, Robert, a groom, a\nhelper, a footman; all but Robert, (and he is accessary to my ruin,)\nstrange creatures, that promise nothing; and all likewise devoted to\nthis woman. The gardener looks like a good honest man; but he is kept at\na distance, and seems reserved.\n\nI wondered I saw not Mr. Williams the clergyman, but would not ask after\nhim, apprehending it might give some jealousy; but when I had beheld the\nrest, he was the only one I had hopes of; for I thought his cloth would\nset him above assisting in my ruin.--But in the afternoon he came; for\nit seems he has a little Latin school in the neighbouring village, which\nhe attends; and this brings him in a little matter, additional to my\nmaster's favour, till something better falls, of which he has hopes.\n\nHe is a sensible sober young gentleman; and when I saw him I confirmed\nmyself in my hopes of him; for he seemed to take great notice of my\ndistress and grief; (for I could not hide it;) though he appeared\nfearful of Mrs. Jewkes, who watched all our motions and words.\n\nHe has an apartment in the house; but is mostly at a lodging in the\ntown, for a conveniency of his little school; only on Saturday afternoon\nand Sundays: and he preaches sometimes for the minister of the village,\nwhich is about three miles off.\n\nI hope to go to church with him to-morrow: Sure it is not in her\ninstructions to deny me! He can't have thought of every thing! And\nsomething may strike out for me there.\n\nI have asked her, for a feint, (because she shan't think I am so well\nprovided,) to indulge me with pen and ink, though I have been using my\nown so freely when her absence would let me; for I begged to be left to\nmyself as much as possible. She says she will let me have it; but then\nI must promise not to send any writing out of the house, without her\nseeing it. I said, it was only to divert my grief when I was by myself,\nas I desired to be; for I loved writing as well as reading; but I had\nnobody to send to, she knew well enough.\n\nNo, not at present, may be, said she; but I am told you are a great\nwriter; and it is in my instructions to see all you write: So, look you\nhere, said she, I will let you have a pen and ink, and two sheets of\npaper: for this employment will keep you out of worse thoughts: but I\nmust see them always when I ask, written or not written. That's very\nhard, said I; but may I not have to myself the closet in the room where\nwe lie, with the key to lock up my things? I believe I may consent to\nthat, said she; and I will set it in order for you, and leave the key\nin the door. And there is a spinnet too, said she; if it be in tune, you\nmay play to divert you now and then; for I know my old lady learnt you:\nAnd below is my master's library: you may take out what books you will.\n\nAnd, indeed, these and my writing will be all my amusement: for I have\nno work given me to do; and the spinnet, if in tune, will not find my\nmind, I am sure, in tune to play upon it. But I went directly and picked\nout some books from the library, with which I filled a shelf in the\ncloset she gave me possession of; and from these I hope to receive\nimprovement, as well as amusement. But no sooner was her back turned,\nthan I set about hiding a pen of my own here, and another there, for\nfear I should come to be denied, and a little of my ink in a broken\nChina cup, and a little in another cup; and a sheet of paper here and\nthere among my linen, with a little of the wax, and a few wafers, in\nseveral places, lest I should be searched; and something, I thought,\nmight happen to open a way for my deliverance, by these or some\nother means. O the pride, thought I, I shall have, if I can secure my\ninnocence, and escape the artful wiles of this wicked master! For, if\nhe comes hither, I am undone, to be sure! For this naughty woman will\nassist him, rather than fail, in the worst of his attempts; and he'll\nhave no occasion to send her out of the way, as he would have done Mrs.\nJervis once. So I must set all my little wits at work.\n\nIt is a grief to me to write, and not to be able to send to you what I\nwrite: but now it is all the diversion I have, and if God will favour my\nescape with my innocence, as I trust he graciously will, for all these\nblack prospects, with what pleasure shall I read them afterwards!\n\nI was going to say, Pray for your dutiful daughter, as I used; but,\nalas! you cannot know my distress, though I am sure I have your prayers:\nAnd I will write on as things happen, that if a way should open, my\nscribble may be ready to be sent: For what I do, must be at a jerk, to\nbe sure.\n\nO how I want such an obliging honest-hearted man as John!\n\n\nI am now come to SUNDAY.\n\nWell, here is a sad thing! I am denied by this barbarous woman to go\nto church, as I had built upon I might: and she has huffed poor Mr.\nWilliams all to pieces, for pleading for me. I find he is to be forbid\nthe house, if she pleases. Poor gentleman! all his dependance is upon my\nmaster, who has a very good living for him, if the incumbent die; and he\nhas kept his bed these four months, of old age and dropsy.\n\nHe pays me great respect, and I see pities me; and would, perhaps,\nassist my escape from these dangers: But I have nobody to plead for me;\nand why should I wish to ruin a poor gentleman, by engaging him against\nhis interest? Yet one would do any thing to preserve one's innocence;\nand Providence would, perhaps, make it up to him!\n\nO judge (but how shall you see what I write!) of my distracted\ncondition, to be reduced to such a pass as to a desire to lay traps for\nmankind! But he wants sadly to say something to me, as he whisperingly\nhinted.\n\nThe wretch (I think I will always call her the wretch henceforth) abuses\nme more and more. I was but talking to one of the maids just now,\nindeed a little to tamper with her by degrees: and she popt upon us,\nand said--Nay, madam, don't offer to tempt poor innocent country maidens\nfrom doing their duty. You wanted, I hear, she should take a walk with\nyou. But I charge you, Nan, never stir with her, nor obey her, without\nletting me know it, in the smallest trifles.--I say, walk with you! and\nwhere would you go, I tro'? Why, barbarous Mrs. Jewkes, said I, only to\nlook a little up the elm-walk, since you would not let me go to church.\n\nNan, said she, to shew me how much they were all in her power, pull\noff madam's shoes, and bring them to me. I have taken care of her\nothers.--Indeed she shan't, said I.--Nay, said Nan, but I must if my\nmistress bids me: so pray, madam, don't hinder me. And so indeed (would\nyou believe it?) she took my shoes off, and left me barefoot: and, for\nmy share, I have been so frighted at this, that I have not power even\nto relieve my mind by my tears. I am quite stupefied to be sure!--Here I\nwas forced to leave off.\n\nNow I will give you a picture of this wretch: She is a broad, squat,\npursy, fat thing, quite ugly, if any thing human can be so called; about\nforty years old. She has a huge hand, and an arm as thick as my waist, I\nbelieve. Her nose is flat and crooked, and her brows grow down over her\neyes; a dead spiteful, grey, goggling eye, to be sure she has. And her\nface is flat and broad; and as to colour, looks like as if it had been\npickled a month in saltpetre: I dare say she drinks:--She has a hoarse,\nman-like voice, and is as thick as she is long; and yet looks so deadly\nstrong, that I am afraid she would dash me at her foot in an instant,\nif I was to vex her.--So that with a heart more ugly than her face, she\nfrightens me sadly: and I am undone to be sure, if God does not protect\nme; for she is very, very wicked--indeed she is.\n\nThis is poor helpless spite in me:--But the picture is too near the\ntruth notwithstanding. She sends me a message just now, that I shall\nhave my shoes again, if I will accept of her company to walk with me in\nthe garden.--To waddle with me, rather, thought I.\n\nWell, 'tis not my business to quarrel with her downright. I shall\nbe watched the narrower, if I do; and so I will go with the hated\nwretch.--O for my dear Mrs. Jervis! or, rather, to be safe with my dear\nfather and mother.\n\n\nOh! I am out of my wits for joy! Just as I have got my shoes on, I\nam told John, honest John, is come on horseback!--A blessing on his\nfaithful heart! What joy is this! But I'll tell you more by and by. I\nmust not let her know I am so glad to see this dear blessed John, to be\nsure!--Alas! but he looks sad, as I see him out of the window! What can\nbe the matter!--I hope my dear parents are well, and Mrs. Jervis, and\nMr. Longman, and every body, my naughty master not excepted;--for I wish\nhim to live and repent of all his wickedness to poor me.\n\nO dear heart! what a world do we live in!--I am now come to take up my\npen again: But I am in a sad taking truly! Another puzzling trial, to be\nsure.\n\n\nHere was John, as I said, and the poor man came to me, with Mrs. Jewkes,\nwho whispered, that I would say nothing about the shoes, for my own\nsake, as she said. The poor man saw my distress, by my red eyes, and my\nhagged looks, I suppose; for I have had a sad time of it, you must needs\nthink; and though he would have hid it, if he could, yet his own eyes\nran over. Oh, Mrs. Pamela; said he; Oh, Mrs. Pamela! Well, honest\nfellow-servant, said I, I cannot help it at present: I am obliged to\nyour honesty and kindness, to be sure; and then he wept more. Said I,\n(for my heart was ready to break to see his grief; for it is a touching\nthing to see a man cry), Tell me the worst! Is my master coming? No, no,\nsaid he, and sobbed.--Well, said I, is there any news of my poor father\nand mother? How do they do?--I hope well, said he, I know nothing to the\ncontrary. There is no mishap, I hope, to Mrs. Jervis or to Mr. Longman,\nor my fellow-servants!--No--said he, poor man! with a long N--o, as if\nhis heart would burst. Well, thank God then! said I.\n\nThe man's a fool, said Mrs. Jewkes, I think: What ado is here! Why, sure\nthou'rt in love, John. Dost thou not see young madam is well? What ails\nthee, man? Nothing at all, said he; but I am such a fool as to cry for\njoy to see good Mrs. Pamela: But I have a letter for you.\n\nI took it, and saw it was from my master; so I put it in my pocket. Mrs.\nJewkes, said I, you need not, I hope, see this. No, no, said she, I\nsee whose it is, well enough; or else, may be, I must have insisted on\nreading it.\n\nAnd here is one for you, Mrs. Jewkes, said he; but yours, said he to\nme, requires an answer, which I must carry back early in the morning, or\nto-night, if I can.\n\nYou have no more, John, said Mrs. Jewkes, for Mrs. Pamela, have you? No,\nsaid he, I have not, but every body's kind love and service. Ay, to us\nboth, to be sure, said she. John, said I, I will read the letter, and\npray take care of yourself; for you are a good man, God bless you! and\nI rejoice to see you, and hear from you all. But I longed to say more;\nonly that nasty Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nSo I went up, and locked myself in my closet, and opened the letter; and\nthis is a copy of it:\n\n\n'My DEAREST PAMELA,\n\n'I send purposely to you on an affair that concerns you very much,\nand me somewhat, but chiefly for your sake. I am conscious that I have\nproceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your fears, and\ngive concern to your honest friends: and all my pleasure is, that I\ncan and will make you amends for the disturbance I have given you. As\nI promised, I sent to your father the day after your departure, that he\nmight not be too much concerned for you, and assured him of my honour to\nyou; and made an excuse, such an one as ought to have satisfied him, for\nyour not coming to him. But this was not sufficient, it seems; for he,\npoor man! came to me next morning, and set my family almost in an uproar\nabout you.\n\n'O my dear girl! what trouble has not your obstinacy given me, and\nyourself too! I had no way to pacify him, but to promise that he should\nsee a letter written from you to Mrs. Jervis, to satisfy him you are\nwell.\n\n'Now all my care in this case is for your aged parents, lest they should\nbe touched with too fatal a grief; and for you, whose duty and affection\nfor them I know to be so strong and laudable; for this reason I beg you\nwill write a few lines to them, and let me prescribe the form; which I\nhave done, putting myself as near as I can in your place, and expressing\nyour sense, with a warmth that I doubt will have too much possessed you.\n\n'After what is done, and which cannot now be helped, but which, I assure\nyou, shall turn out honourably for you, I expect not to be refused;\nbecause I cannot possibly have any view in it, but to satisfy your\nparents; which is more your concern than mine; and so I must beg you\nwill not alter one tittle of the underneath. If you do, it will be\nimpossible for me to send it, or that it should answer the good end I\npropose by it.\n\n'I have promised, that I will not approach you without your leave. If I\nfind you easy, and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present lot,\nI will keep to my word, although it is a difficulty upon me. Nor shall\nyour restraint last long: for I will assure you, that I am resolved very\nsoon to convince you of my good intentions, and with what ardour I am\n\n                                                     'Yours, etc.'\n\n\nThe letter he prescribed for me was as this:\n\n\n'DEAR Mrs. JERVIS,\n\n'I have, instead of being driven by Robin to my dear father's, been\ncarried off, where I have no liberty to tell. However, at present, I\nam not used hardly; and I write to beg you to let my dear father and\nmother, whose hearts must be well nigh broken, know that I am well; and\nthat I am, and, by the grace of God, ever will be, their honest, as well\nas dutiful daughter, and 'Your obliged friend.'\n\n'I must neither send date nor place; but have most solemn assurances of\nhonourable usage.'\n\n\nI knew not what to do on this most strange request and occasion. But my\nheart bled so much for you, my dear father, who had taken the pains to\ngo yourself, and inquire after your poor daughter, as well as for my\ndear mother, that I resolved to write, and pretty much in the above\nform, that it might be sent to pacify you, till I could let you, somehow\nor other, know the true state of the matter. And I wrote thus to my\nstrange wicked master himself:\n\n\n'SIR,\n\n'If you knew but the anguish of my mind, and how much I suffer by\nyour dreadful usage of me, you would surely pity me, and consent to my\ndeliverance. What have I done, that I should be the only mark of your\ncruelty? I can have no hope, no desire of living left me, because I\ncannot have the least dependence, after what has passed, upon your\nsolemn assurances.--It is impossible they should be consistent with the\ndishonourable methods you take.\n\n'Nothing but your promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable\nbondage, can give me the least ray of hope.\n\n'Don't, I beseech you, drive the poor distressed Pamela upon a rock,\nthat may be the destruction both of her soul and body! You don't know,\nsir, how dreadfully I dare, weak as I am of mind and intellect, when my\nvirtue is in danger. And, O! hasten my deliverance, that a poor unworthy\ncreature, below the notice of such a gentleman as you, may not be made\nthe sport of a high condition, for no reason in the world, but because\nshe is not able to defend herself, nor has a friend that can right her.\n\n'I have, sir, in part to shew my obedience to you, but indeed, I own,\nmore to give ease to the minds of my poor distressed parents, whose\npoverty, one would think, should screen them from violences of this\nsort, as well as their poor daughter, followed pretty much the form\nyou have prescribed for me, in the letter to Mrs. Jervis; and the\nalterations I have made (for I could not help a few) are of such a\nnature, as, though they shew my concern a little, yet must answer the\nend you are pleased to say you propose by this letter.\n\n'For God's sake, good sir, pity my lowly condition, and my present great\nmisery; and let me join with all the rest of your servants to bless that\ngoodness, which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted,\nheart-broken 'PAMELA.'\n\n\nI thought, when I had written this letter, and that which he had\nprescribed, it would look like placing a confidence in Mrs. Jewkes, to\nshew them to her; and I shewed her, at the same time, my master's letter\nto me; for I believed the value he expressed for me, would give me\ncredit with one who professed in every thing to serve him, right or\nwrong; though I had so little reason, I fear, to pride myself in it: and\nI was not mistaken; for it has seemed to influence her not a little, and\nshe is at present mighty obliging, and runs over in my praises; but\nis the less to be minded, because she praises as much the author of my\nmiseries, and his honourable intentions, as she calls them; for I see,\nthat she is capable of thinking, as I fear he does, that every thing\nthat makes for his wicked will is honourable, though to the ruin of the\ninnocent. Pray God I may find it otherwise! Though, I hope, whatever\nthe wicked gentleman may intend, that I shall be at last rid of her\nimpertinent bold way of talk, when she seems to think, from his letter,\nthat he means honourably.\n\n\nI am now come to MONDAY, the 5th Day of my Bondage and Misery.\n\nI was in hope to have an opportunity to see John, and have a little\nprivate talk with him, before he went away; but it could not be. The\npoor man's excessive sorrow made Mrs. Jewkes take it into her head, to\nthink he loved me; and so she brought up a message to me from him this\nmorning that he was going. I desired he might come up to my closet, as I\ncalled it, and she came with him. The honest man, as I thought him,\nwas as full of concern as before, at taking leave and I gave him two\nletters, the one for Mrs. Jervis, enclosed in another for my master: but\nMrs. Jewkes would see me seal them up, lest I should enclose any thing\nelse.--I was surprised, at the man's going away, to see him drop a bit\nof paper, just at the head of the stairs, which I took up without being\nobserved by Mrs. Jewkes: but I was a thousand times more surprised, when\nI returned to my closet, and opening it read as follows:\n\n\n'GOOD MRS. PAMELA,\n\n'I am grieved to tell you how much you have been deceived and betrayed,\nand that by such a vile dog as I. Little did I think it would come to\nthis. But I must say, if ever there was a rogue in the world, it is me.\nI have all along shewed your letters to my master: He employed me for\nthat purpose; and he saw every one, before I carried them to your father\nand mother; and then scaled them up, and sent me with them. I had some\nbusiness that way, but not half so often as I pretended: and as soon\nas I heard how it was, I was ready to hang myself. You may well think I\ncould not stand in your presence. O vile, vile wretch, to bring you to\nthis! If you are ruined, I am the rogue that caused it. All the justice\nI can do you, is to tell you, you are in vile hands; and I am afraid\nwill be undone in spite of all your sweet innocence; and I believe\nI shall never live, after I know it. If you can forgive me, you are\nexceeding good; but I shall never forgive myself, that's certain.\nHowsomever, it will do you no good to make this known; and may-hap I\nmay live to do you service. If I can, I will: I am sure I ought.--Master\nkept your last two or three letters, and did not send them at all. I am\nthe most abandoned wretch of wretches. 'J. ARNOLD.'\n\n'You see your undoing has been long hatching. Pray take care of your\nsweet self. Mrs. Jewkes is a devil: but in my master's t'other house you\nhave not one false heart, but myself. Out upon me for a villain!'\n\n\nMy dear father and mother, when you come to this place, I make no doubt\nyour hair will stand on end as mine does!--O the deceitfulness of the\nheart of man!--This John, that I took to be the honestest of men; that\nyou took for the same; that was always praising you to me, and me to\nyou, and for nothing so much as for our honest hearts; this very fellow\nwas all the while a vile hypocrite, and a perfidious wretch, and helping\nto carry on my ruin.\n\nBut he says so much of himself, that I will only sit down with this\nsad reflection, That power and riches never want tools to promote their\nvilest ends, and there is nothing so hard to be known as the heart\nof man:--I can but pity the poor wretch, since he seems to have great\nremorse, and I believe it best to keep his wickedness secret. If it lies\nin my way, I will encourage his penitence; for I may possibly make some\ndiscoveries by it.\n\nOne thing I should mention in this place; he brought down, in a\nportmanteau, all the clothes and things my lady and master had given me,\nand moreover two velvet hoods, and a velvet scarf, that used to be worn\nby my lady; but I have no comfort in them, or any thing else.\n\nMrs. Jewkes had the portmanteau brought into my closet, and she shewed\nme what was in it; but then locked it up, and said, she would let me\nhave what I would out of it, when I asked; but if I had the key, it\nmight make me want to go abroad, may be; and so the confident woman put\nit in her pocket.\n\nI gave myself over to sad reflections upon this strange and surprising\ndiscovery of John's, and wept much for him, and for myself too; for now\nI see, as he says, my ruin has been long hatching, that I can make no\ndoubt what my master's honourable professions will end in. What a heap\nof hard names does the poor fellow call himself! But what must they\ndeserve, then, who set him to work? O what has this wicked master to\nanswer for, to be so corrupt himself, and to corrupt others, who would\nhave been all innocent; and to carry on a poor plot, I am sure for a\ngentleman, to ruin a poor creature, who never did him harm, nor wished\nhim any; and who can still pray for his happiness, and his repentance?\n\nI can't but wonder what these gentlemen, as they are called, can think\nof themselves for these vile doings! John had some inducement; for he\nhoped to please his master, who rewarded him and was bountiful to him;\nand the same may be said, bad as she is, for this same odious Mrs.\nJewkes. But what inducement has my master for taking so much pains to do\nthe devil's work for him?--If he loves me, as 'tis falsely called, must\nhe therefore lay traps for me, to ruin me and make me as bad as himself?\nI cannot imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as I can\nprocure him.--To be sure, I am a very worthless body. People, indeed,\nsay I am handsome; but if I was so, should not a gentleman prefer an\nhonest servant to a guilty harlot? And must he be more earnest to seduce\nme, because I dread of all things to be seduced, and would rather lose\nmy life than my honesty?\n\nWell, these are strange things to me! I cannot account for them, for\nmy share; but sure nobody will say, that these fine gentlemen have any\ntempter but their own wicked wills!--his naughty master could run\naway from me, when he apprehended his servants might discover his vile\nattempts upon me in that sad closet affair; but is it not strange that\nhe should not be afraid of the all-seeing eye, from which even that\nbase plotting heart of his, in its most secret motions, could not be\nhid?--But what avail me these sorrowful reflections? He is and will be\nwicked, and designs me a victim to his lawless attempts, if the God in\nwhom I trust, and to whom I hourly pray, prevent it not.\n\n\nTuesday and Wednesday.\n\nI have been hindered by this wicked woman's watching me so close, from\nwriting on Tuesday; and so I will put both these days together. I have\nbeen a little turn with her for an airing, in the chariot, and walked\nseveral times in the garden; but have always her at my heels.\n\nMr. Williams came to see us, and took a walk with us once; and while her\nback was just turned, (encouraged by the hint he had before given me,)\nI said, Sir, I see two tiles upon that parsley-bed; might not one cover\nthem with mould, with a note between them, on occasion?--A good hint,\nsaid he; let that sunflower by the back-door of the garden be the place;\nI have a key to the door; for it is my nearest way to the town.\n\nSo I was forced to begin. O what inventions will necessity push us upon!\nI hugged myself at the thought; and she coming to us, he said, as if he\nwas continuing a discourse we were in: No, not extraordinary pleasant.\nWhat's that? what's that? said Mrs. Jewkes.--Only, said he, the town,\nI'm saying, is not very pleasant. No, indeed, said she, it is not; it is\na poor town, to my thinking. Are there any gentry in it? said I. And so\nwe chatted on about the town, to deceive her. But my deceit intended no\nhurt to any body.\n\nWe then talked of the garden, how large and pleasant, and the like; and\nsat down on the tufted slope of the fine fish-pond, to see the fishes\nplay upon the surface of the water; and she said, I should angle if I\nwould.\n\nI wish, said I, you'd be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits. Pretty\nmistress! said she--I know better than that, I'll assure you, at this\ntime.--I mean no harm, said I, indeed. Let me tell you, said she. I know\nnone who have their thoughts more about them than you. A body ought\nto look to it where you are. But we'll angle a little to-morrow. Mr.\nWilliams, who is much afraid of her, turned the discourse to a general\nsubject. I sauntered in, and left them to talk by themselves; but he\nwent away to town, and she was soon after me.\n\nI had got to my pen and ink; and I said, I want some paper, Mrs. Jewkes,\n(putting what I was about in my bosom:) You know I have written two\nletters, and sent them by John. (O how his name, poor guilty fellow,\ngrieves me!) Well, said she, you have some left; one sheet did for those\ntwo letters. Yes, said I; but I used half another for a cover, you\nknow; and see how I have scribbled the other half; and so I shewed her\na parcel of broken scraps of verses, which I had tried to recollect, and\nhad written purposely that she might see, and think me usually employed\nto such idle purposes. Ay, said she, so you have; well, I'll give you\ntwo sheets more; but let me see how you dispose of them, either written\nor blank. Well, thought I, I hope still, Argus, to be too hard for thee.\nNow Argus, the poets say, had a hundred eyes, and was set to watch with\nthem all, as she does.\n\nShe brought me the paper, and said, Now, madam, let me see you write\nsomething. I will, said I; and took the pen and wrote, 'I wish Mrs.\nJewkes would be so good to me, as I would be to her, if I had it in my\npower.'--That's pretty now, said she; well, I hope I am; but what then?\n'Why then (wrote I) she would do me the favour to let me know, what I\nhave done to be made her prisoner; and what she thinks is to become\nof me.' Well, and what then? said she. 'Why then, of consequence,\n(scribbled I,) she would let me see her instructions, that I may know\nhow far to blame, or to acquit her.'\n\nThus I fooled on, to shew her my fondness for scribbling; for I had no\nexpectation of any good from her; that so she might suppose I employed\nmyself, as I said, to no better purpose at other times: for she will\nhave it, that I am upon some plot, I am so silent, and love so much to\nbe by myself.--She would have made me write on a little further. No,\nsaid I; you have not answered me. Why, said she, what can you doubt,\nwhen my master himself assures you of his honour? Ay, said I; but lay\nyour hand to your heart, Mrs. Jewkes, and tell me, if you yourself\nbelieve him. Yes, said she, to be sure I do. But, said I, what do you\ncall honour? Why, said she, what does he call honour, think you?--Ruin!\nshame! disgrace! said I, I fear.--Pho! pho! said she; if you have any\ndoubt about it, he can best explain his own meaning:--I'll send him word\nto come and satisfy you, if you will.--Horrid creature! said I, all in a\nfright--Can'st thou not stab me to the heart? I'd rather thou would'st,\nthan say such another word!--But I hope there is no such thought of his\ncoming.\n\nShe had the wickedness to say, No, no; he don't intend to come, as\nI know of--But if I was he, I would not be long away. What means the\nwoman? said I.--Mean! said she, (turning it off;) why I mean, I would\ncome, if I was he, and put an end to all your fears--by making you as\nhappy as you wish. It is out of his power, said I, to make me happy,\ngreat and rich as he is! but by leaving me innocent, and giving me\nliberty to go to my dear father and mother.\n\nShe went away soon after, and I ended my letter, in hopes to have an\nopportunity to lay it in the appointed place. So I went to her, and\nsaid; I suppose, as it is not dark, I may take another turn in the\ngarden. It is too late, said she; but if you will go, don't stay; and,\nNan, see and attend madam, as she called me.\n\nSo I went towards the pond, the maid following me, and dropt purposely\nmy hussy: and when I came near the tiles, I said, Mrs. Anne, I have\ndropt my hussy; be so kind as to look for it; I had it by the pond\nside. She went back to look, and I slipt the note between the tiles,\nand covered them as quick as I could with the light mould, quite\nunperceived; and the maid finding the hussy, I took it, and sauntered\nin again, and met Mrs. Jewkes coming to see after me. What I wrote was\nthis:\n\n\n'REVEREND SIR,\n\n'The want of an opportunity to speak my mind to you, I am sure will\nexcuse this boldness in a poor creature that is betrayed hither, I have\nreason to think, for the worst of purposes. You know something, to be\nsure, of my story, my native poverty, which I am not ashamed of, my late\nlady's goodness, and my master's designs upon me. It is true he promises\nhonour, and all that; but the honour of the wicked is disgrace and shame\nto the virtuous: And he may think he keeps his promises, according to\nthe notions he may allow himself to hold; and yet, according to mine and\nevery good body's, basely ruin me.\n\n'I am so wretched, and ill-treated by this Mrs. Jewkes, and she is so\nill-principled a woman, that, as I may soon want the opportunity which\nthe happy hint of this day affords to my hopes, I throw myself at once\nupon your goodness, without the least reserve; for I cannot be worse\nthan I am, should that fail me; which, I dare say, to your power, it\nwill not: For I see it, sir, in your looks, I hope it from your cloth,\nand I doubt it not from your inclination, in a case circumstanced as my\nunhappy one is. For, sir, in helping me out of my present distress,\nyou perform all the acts of religion in one; and the highest mercy and\ncharity, both to the body and soul of a poor wretch, that, believe\nme, sir, has, at present, not so much as in thought swerved from her\ninnocence.\n\n'Is there not some way to be found out for my escape, without danger to\nyourself? Is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood,\nto whom I may fly, only till l can find a way to get to my poor father\nand mother? Cannot Lady Davers be made acquainted with my sad story, by\nyour conveying a letter to her? My poor parents are so low in the world,\nthey can do nothing but break their hearts for me; and that, I fear,\nwill be the end of it.\n\n'My master promises, if I will be easy, as he calls it, in my present\nlot, he will not come down without my consent. Alas! sir, this is\nnothing: For what's the promise of a person who thinks himself at\nliberty to act as he has done by me? If he comes, it must be to ruin me;\nand come to be sure he will, when he thinks he has silenced the clamours\nof my friends, and lulled me, as no doubt he hopes, into a fatal\nsecurity.\n\n'Now, therefore, sir, is all the time I have to work and struggle for\nthe preservation of my honesty. If I stay till he comes, I am undone.\nYou have a key to the back garden door; I have great hopes from that.\nStudy, good sir, and contrive for me. I will faithfully keep your\nsecret.--Yet I should be loath to have you suffer for me! I say no more,\nbut commit this to the happy tiles, in the bosom of that earth, where, I\nhope, my deliverance will take root, and bring forth such fruit, as may\nturn to my inexpressible joy, and your eternal reward, both here and\nhereafter: As shall ever pray, 'Your oppressed humble servant.'\n\n\nThursday.\n\nThis completes a terrible week since my setting out, as I hoped to see\nyou, my dear father and mother. O how different were my hopes then, from\nwhat they are now! Yet who knows what these happy tiles may produce!\n\nBut I must tell you, first, how I have been beaten by Mrs. Jewkes! It is\nvery true!--And thus it came about:\n\nMy impatience was great to walk in the garden, to see if any thing had\noffered, answerable to my hopes. But this wicked Mrs. Jewkes would not\nlet me go without her; and said, she was not at leisure. We had a great\nmany words about it; for I told her, it was very hard I could not be\ntrusted to walk by myself in the garden for a little air, but must be\ndogged and watched worse than a thief.\n\nShe still pleaded her instructions, and said she was not to trust me\nout of her sight: And you had better, said she, be easy and contented, I\nassure you; for I have worse orders than you have yet found. I remember,\nadded she, your asking Mr. Williams, If there were any gentry in the\nneighbourhood? This makes me suspect you want to get away to them, to\ntell your sad dismal story, as you call it.\n\nMy heart was at my mouth; for I feared, by that hint, she had seen my\nletter under the tiles: O how uneasy I was! At last she said, Well,\nsince you take on so, you may take a turn, and I will be with you in a\nminute.\n\nWhen I was out of sight of her window, I speeded towards the hopeful\nplace; but was soon forced to slacken my pace, by her odious voice:\nHey-day, why so nimble, and whither so fast? said she: What! are you\nupon a wager? I stopt for her, till her pursy sides were waddled up to\nme; and she held by my arm, half out of breath: So I was forced to pass\nby the dear place, without daring to look at it.\n\nThe gardener was at work a little farther, and so we looked upon him,\nand I began to talk about his art; but she said, softly, My instructions\nare, not to let you be so familiar with the servants. Why, said I, are\nyou afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my\nmaster? May be I am, said the odious wretch; for to rob him of yourself,\nwould be the worst that could happen to him, in his opinion.\n\nAnd pray, said I, walking on, how came I to be his property? What right\nhas he in me, but such as a thief may plead to stolen goods?--Why,\nwas ever the like heard? says she.--This is downright rebellion, I\nprotest!--Well, well, lambkin, (which the foolish often calls me,) if\nI was in his place, he should not have his property in you long\nquestionable. Why, what would you do, said I, if you were he?--Not stand\nshill-I-shall-I, as he does; but put you and himself both out of your\npain.--Why, Jezebel, said I, (I could not help it,) would you ruin me by\nforce?--Upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder: Take that,\nsaid she; whom do you call Jezebel?\n\nI was so surprised, (for you never beat me, my dear father and mother,\nin your lives,) that I was like one thunder-struck; and looked round, as\nif I wanted somebody to help me; but, alas! I had nobody; and said, at\nlast, rubbing my shoulder, Is this also in your instructions?--Alas! for\nme! am I to be beaten too? And so fell a crying, and threw myself upon\nthe grass-walk we were upon.--Said she, in a great pet, I won't be\ncalled such names, I'll assure you. Marry come up! I see you have\na spirit: You must and shall be kept under. I'll manage such little\nprovoking things as you, I warrant ye! Come, come, we'll go in a'doors,\nand I'll lock you up, and you shall have no shoes, nor any thing else,\nif this be the case.\n\nI did not know what to do. This was a cruel thing to me, and I blamed\nmyself for my free speech; for now I have given her some pretence: and\nO! thought I, here I have, by my malapertness, ruined the only project I\nhad left.\n\nThe gardener saw this scene: but she called to him, Well, Jacob, what do\nyou stare at? Pray mind what you're upon. And away he walked, to another\nquarter, out of sight.\n\nWell, thought I, I must put on the dissembler a little, I see. She took\nmy hand roughly; Come, get up, said she, and come in a'doors!--I'll\nJezebel you, I will so!--Why, dear Mrs. Jewkes, said I.--None of your\ndears, and your coaxing! said she; why not Jezebel again?--She was in\na fearful passion, I saw, and I was out of my wits. Thought I, I\nhave often heard women blamed for their tongues; I wish mine had been\nshorter. But I can't go in, said I, indeed I can't!--Why, said she,\ncan't you? I'll warrant I can take such a thin body as you under my arm,\nand carry you in, if you won't walk. You don't know my strength.--Yes,\nbut I do, said I, too well; and will you not use me worse when I come\nin?--So I arose, and she muttered to herself all the way, She to be a\nJezebel with me, that had used me so well! and such like.\n\nWhen I came near the house, I said, sitting down upon a settle-bench,\nWell, I will not go in, till you say you forgive me, Mrs. Jewkes.--If\nyou will forgive my calling you that name, I will forgive your beating\nme.--She sat down by me, and seemed in a great pucker, and said, Well,\ncome, I will forgive you for this time: and so kissed me, as a mark of\nreconciliation.--But pray, said I, tell me where I am to walk and go,\nand give me what liberty you can; and when I know the most you can\nfavour me with, you shall see I will be as content as I can, and not ask\nyou for more.\n\nAy, said she, this is something like: I wish I could give you all the\nliberty you desire; for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie\nyou to my petticoat, as it were, and not let you stir without me.--But\npeople that will do their duties, must have some trouble: and what I\ndo, is to serve as good a master, to be sure, as lives.--Yes, said I, to\nevery body but me! He loves you too well, to be sure, returned she;\nand that's the reason: so you ought to bear it. I say, love! replied I.\nCome, said she, don't let the wench see you have been crying, nor tell\nher any tales: for you won't tell them fairly, I am sure: and I'll send\nher, and you shall take another walk in the garden, if you will: May be\nit will get you a stomach to your dinner: for you don't eat enough\nto keep life and soul together. You are beauty to the bone, added the\nstrange wretch, or you could not look so well as you do, with so little\nstomach, so little rest, and so much pining and whining for nothing at\nall. Well, thought I, say what thou wilt, so I can be rid of thy bad\ntongue and company: and I hope to find some opportunity now to come at\nmy sunflower. But I walked the other way, to take that in my return, to\navoid suspicion.\n\nI forced my discourse to the maid; but it was all upon general things;\nfor I find she is asked after every thing I say and do. When I came near\nthe place, as I had been devising, I said, Pray step to the gardener,\nand ask him to gather a sallad for me to dinner. She called out, Jacob!\nsaid I, He can't hear you so far off; and pray tell him, I should like\na cucumber too, if he has one. When she had stept about a bow-shot from\nme, I popt down, and whipt my fingers under the upper tile, and pulled\nout a letter without direction, and thrust it in my bosom, trembling for\njoy. She was with me, before I could well secure it; and I was in such\na taking that I feared I should discover myself. You seem frightened,\nmadam, said she; Why, said I, with a lucky thought, (alas! your poor\ndaughter will make an intriguer by and by; but I hope an innocent one!)\nI stooped to smell at the sunflower, and a great nasty worm ran into the\nground, that startled me; for I can't abide worms. Said she, Sunflowers\ndon't smell. So I find, replied I. And then we walked in; and Mrs.\nJewkes said; Well, you have made haste now.--You shall go another time.\n\nI went up to my closet, locked myself in, and opening my letter, found\nin it these words:\n\n\n'I am infinitely concerned for your distress. I most heartily wish it\nmay be in my power to serve and save so much innocence, beauty, and\nmerit. My whole dependance is upon Mr. B----, and I have a near view of\nbeing provided for by his favour to me. But yet I would sooner forfeit\nall my hopes in him, (trusting in God for the rest,) than not assist\nyou, if possible. I never looked upon Mr. B---- in the light he\nnow appears in to me, in your case. To be sure, he is no professed\ndebauchee. But I am entirely of opinion, you should, if possible, get\nout of his hands; and especially as you are in very bad ones in Mrs.\nJewkes's.\n\n'We have here the widow Lady Jones, mistress of a good fortune; and a\nwoman of virtue, I believe. We have also old Sir Simon Darnford, and his\nlady, who is a good woman; and they have two daughters, virtuous young\nladies. All the rest are but middling people, and traders, at best. I\nwill try, if you please, either Lady Jones, or Lady Darnford, if they'll\npermit you to take refuge with them. I see no probability of keeping\nmyself concealed in this matter; but will, as I said, risk all things\nto serve you; for I never saw a sweetness and innocence like yours; and\nyour hard case has attached me entirely to you; for I know, as you\nso happily express, if I can serve you in this case, I shall thereby\nperform all the acts of religion in one.\n\n'As to Lady Davers, I will convey a letter, if you please, to her; but\nit must not be from our post-house, I give you caution; for the man\nowes all his bread to Mr. B----, and his place too; and I believe, by\nsomething that dropt from him, over a can of ale, has his instructions.\nYou don't know how you are surrounded; all which confirms me in your\nopinion, that no honour is meant you, let what will be professed; and I\nam glad you want no caution on that head.\n\n'Give me leave to say, that I had heard much in your praise; but, I\nthink, greatly short of what you deserve, both as to person and mind:\nMy eyes convince me of the one, your letter of the other. For fear\nof losing the present lucky opportunity, I am longer than otherwise I\nshould be. But I will not enlarge, any further than to assure you that I\nam, to the best of my power,\n\n                      'Your faithful friend and servant,\n                                                  'ARTHUR WILLIAMS.'\n\n'I will come once every morning, and once every evening, after\nschool-time, to look for your letters. I'll come in, and return without\ngoing into the house, if I see the coast clear: Otherwise, to avoid\nsuspicion, I'll come in.'\n\n\nI instantly, in answer to this pleasing letter, wrote as follows:\n\n\n'REVEREND SIR,\n\n'O how suited to your function, and your character, is your kind letter!\nGod bless you for it! I now think I am beginning to be happy. I should\nbe sorry to have you suffer on my account: but I hope it will be made\nup to you an hundred-fold, by that God whom you so faithfully serve. I\nshould be too happy, could I ever have it in my power to contribute in\nthe least to it. But, alas! to serve me, must be for God's sake only;\nfor I am poor and lowly in fortune; though in mind, I hope, too high to\ndo a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom. But I lose time.----\n\n'Any way you think best, I should be pleased with; for I know not the\npersons, nor in what manner it is best to apply to them. I am glad\nof the hint you so kindly give me of the man at the post-house. I\nwas thinking of opening a way for myself by letter, when I could have\nopportunity; but I see more and more that I am, indeed, strangely\nsurrounded with dangers; and that there is no dependance to be made on\nmy master's honour.\n\n'I should think, sir, if either of those ladies would give leave, I\nmight some way get out by favour of your key: and as it is impossible,\nwatched as I am, to know when it can be, suppose, sir, you get one made\nby it, and put it, the next opportunity, under the sunflower?--I am sure\nno time is to be lost, because it is rather my wonder, that she is\nnot thoughtful about this key, than otherwise; for she forgets not the\nminutest thing. But, sir, if I had this key, I could, if these ladies\nwould not shelter me, run away any where: and if I was once out of the\nhouse, they could have no pretence to force me again; for I have done no\nharm, and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body; and by\nthis way you need not to be known. Torture should not wring it from me,\nI assure you.\n\n'One thing more, good sir. Have you no correspondence with my master's\nBedfordshire family? By that means, may be, I could be informed of\nhis intention of coming hither, and when I enclose you a letter of a\ndeceitful wretch; for I can trust you with any thing; poor John Arnold.\nIts contents will tell why I enclose it. Perhaps by his means, something\nmay be discovered; for he seems willing to atone for his treachery to\nme, by the intimation of future service. I leave the hint to you to\nimprove upon, and am,\n\n              'Reverend Sir,\n                  'Your for ever obliged, and thankful servant.'\n\n'I hope, sir, by your favour, I could send a little packet, now and\nthen, some how, to my poor father and mother. I have a little stock of\nmoney, about five or six guineas: Shall I put half in your hands, to\ndefray the charge of a man and horse, or any other incidents?'\n\n\nI had but just time to transcribe this, before I was called to dinner;\nand I put that for Mr. Williams, with a wafer in it, in my bosom, to get\nan opportunity to lay it in the dear place.\n\nO good sirs, of all the flowers in the garden, the sunflower, sure,\nis the loveliest!--It is a propitious one to me! How nobly my plot\nsucceeds! But I begin to be afraid my writings may be discovered; for\nthey grow large: I stitch them hitherto in my under-coat, next my linen.\nBut if this brute should search me--I must try to please her, and then\nshe won't.\n\nWell, I am but just come off from a walk in the garden, and have\ndeposited my letter by a simple wile. I got some horse-beans; and we\ntook a turn in the garden, to angle, as Mrs. Jewkes had promised me. She\nbaited the hook, and I held it, and soon hooked a lovely carp. Play it,\nplay it, said she: I did, and brought it to the bank. A sad thought just\nthen came into my head; and I took it, and threw it in again; and O the\npleasure it seemed to have, to flounce in, when at liberty!--Why this?\nsays she. O Mrs. Jewkes! said I, I was thinking this poor carp was the\nunhappy Pamela. I was likening you and myself to my naughty master. As\nwe hooked and deceived the poor carp, so was I betrayed by false baits;\nand when you said, Play it, play it, it went to my heart, to think I\nshould sport with the destruction of the poor fish I had betrayed; and I\ncould not but fling it in again: and did you not see the joy with which\nthe happy carp flounced from us? O! said I, may some good merciful body\nprocure me my liberty in the same manner; for to be sure, I think my\ndanger equal!\n\nLord bless thee! said she, what a thought is there!--Well, I can angle\nno more, added I. I'll try my fortune, said she, and took the rod. Do,\nanswered I; and I will plant life, if I can, while you are destroying\nit. I have some horse-beans here, and will go and stick them in one of\nthe borders, to see how long they will be coming up; and I will call\nthem my garden.\n\nSo you see, dear father and mother, (I hope now you will soon see; for,\nmay be, if I can't get away so soon myself, I may send my papers some\nhow; I say you will see,) that this furnishes me with a good excuse to\nlook after my garden another time; and if the mould should look a little\nfreshish, it won't be so much suspected. She mistrusted nothing of this;\nand I went and stuck in here and there my beans, for about the length\nof five ells, of each side of the sunflower; and easily deposited my\nletter. And not a little proud am I of this contrivance. Sure something\nwill do at last!\n\n\nFriday, Saturday.\n\nI have just now told you a trick of mine; now I'll tell you a trick\nof this wicked woman's. She comes up to me: Says she, I have a bill\nI cannot change till to-morrow; and a tradesman wants his money most\nsadly: and I don't love to turn poor trades-folks away without their\nmoney: Have you any about you? I have a little, replied I: How much will\ndo? Oh! said she, I want eight pounds. Alack! said I, I have but between\nfive and six. Lend me that, said she, till to-morrow. I did so; and she\nwent down stairs: and when she came up, she laughed, and said, Well,\nI have paid the tradesman. Said I, I hope you'll give it me again\nto-morrow. At that, the assurance, laughing loud, said, Why, what\noccasion have you for money? To tell you the truth, lambkin, I didn't\nwant it. I only feared you might make a bad use of it; and now I can\ntrust Nan with you a little oftener, especially as I have got the key\nof your portmanteau; so that you can neither corrupt her with money,\nnor fine things. Never did any body look more silly than I.--O how I\nfretted, to be so foolishly outwitted!--And the more, as I had hinted to\nMr. Williams, that I would put some in his hands to defray the charges\nof my sending to you. I cried for vexation.--And now I have not five\nshillings left to support me, if I can get away.--Was ever such a fool\nas I! I must be priding myself in my contrivances, indeed! said I. Was\nthis your instructions, wolfkin? (for she called me lambkin). Jezebel,\nyou mean, child! said she.--Well, I now forgive you heartily; let's buss\nand be friends.--Out upon you said I; I cannot bear you!--But I durst\nnot call her names again; for I dread her huge paw most sadly. The more\nI think of this thing, the more do I regret it, and blame myself.\n\nThis night the man from the post-house brought a letter for Mrs. Jewkes,\nin which was one enclosed for me: She brought it me up. Said she, Well,\nmy good master don't forget us. He has sent you a letter: and see what\nhe writes to me. So she read, That he hoped her fair charge was well,\nhappy, and contented. Ay, to be sure, said I, I can't choose--That he\ndid not doubt her care and kindness to me: that I was very dear to him,\nand she could not use me too well; and the like. There's a master for\nyou! said she: sure you will love and pray for him. I desired her to\nread the rest. No, no, said she, but I won't. Said I, Are there any\norders for taking my shoes away, and for beating me? No, said she, nor\nabout Jezebel neither. Well, returned I, I cry truce; for I have no mind\nto be beat again. I thought, said she, we had forgiven one another.\n\nMy letter is as follows:\n\n\n'MY DEAR PAMELA,\n\n'I begin to repent already, that I have bound myself, by promise, not to\nsee you till you give me leave; for I think the time very tedious.\nCan you place so much confidence in me, as to invite me down? Assure\nyourself, that your generosity shall not be thrown away upon me. I the\nrather would press this, as I am uneasy for your uneasiness; for Mrs.\nJewkes acquaints me, that you take your restraint very heavily; and\nneither eat, drink, nor rest well; and I have too great interest in your\nhealth, not to wish to shorten the time of this trial; which will be\nthe consequence of my coming down to you. John, too, has intimated to me\nyour concern, with a grief that hardly gave him leave for utterance; a\ngrief that a little alarmed my tenderness for you. Not that I fear any\nthing, but that your disregard to me, which yet my proud heart will\nhardly permit me to own, may throw you upon some rashness, that might\nencourage a daring hope: But how poorly do I descend, to be anxious\nabout such a menial as he!--I will only say one thing, that if you\nwill give me leave to attend you at the Hall, (consider who it is that\nrequests this from you as a favour,) I solemnly declare, that you shall\nhave cause to be pleased with this obliging mark of your confidence in\nme, and consideration for me; and if I find Mrs. Jewkes has not behaved\nto you with the respect due to one I so dearly love, I will put it\nentirely into your power to discharge her the house, if you think\nproper; and Mrs. Jervis, or who else you please, shall attend you in her\nplace. This I say on a hint John gave me, as if you resented something\nfrom that quarter. Dearest Pamela, answer favourably this earnest\nrequest of one that cannot live without you, and on whose honour to\nyou, you may absolutely depend; and so much the more, as you place a\nconfidence in it. I am, and assuredly ever will be,\n\n                       'Your faithful and affectionate, etc.'\n\n'You will be glad, I know, to hear your father and mother are well, and\neasy upon your last letter. That gave me a pleasure that I am resolved\nyou shall not repent. Mrs. Jewkes will convey to me your answer.'\n\n\nI but slightly read this letter for the present, to give way to one I\nhad hopes of finding by this time from Mr. Williams. I took an evening\nturn, as I called it, in Mrs. Jewkes's company: and walking by the\nplace, I said, Do you think, Mrs. Jewkes, any of my beans can have\nstruck since yesterday? She laughed, and said, You are a poor gardener:\nbut I love to see you divert yourself. She passing on, I found my good\nfriend had provided for me; and, slipping it in my bosom, (for her back\nwas towards me,) Here, said I, (having a bean in my hand,) is one of\nthem; but it has not stirred. No, to be sure, said she, and turned upon\nme a most wicked jest, unbecoming the mouth of a woman, about planting,\netc. When I came in, I hied to my closet, and read as follows:\n\n\n'I am sorry to tell you that I have had a repulse from Lady Jones. She\nis concerned at your case, she says, but don't care to make herself\nenemies. I applied to Lady Darnford, and told her in the most pathetic\nmanner I could, your sad story, and shewed her your more pathetic\nletter. I found her well disposed, but she would advise with Sir Simon,\nwho by the by is not a man of an extraordinary character for virtue; but\nhe said to his lady in my presence, 'Why, what is all this, my dear, but\nthat our neighbour has a mind to his mother's waiting-maid! And if he\ntakes care she wants for nothing, I don't see any great injury will be\ndone her. He hurts no family by this:' (So, my dear father and mother,\nit seems that poor people's honesty is to go for nothing) 'And I think,\nMr. Williams, you, of all men, should not engage in this affair, against\nyour friend and patron.' He spoke this in so determined a manner, that\nthe lady had done; and I had only to beg no notice should be taken of\nthe matter as from me.\n\n'I have hinted your case to Mr. Peters, the minister of this parish;\nbut I am concerned to say, that he imputed selfish views to me, as if\nI would make an interest in your affections by my zeal. And when I\nrepresented the duties of our function, and the like, and protested my\ndisinterestedness, he coldly said, I was very good; but was a young man,\nand knew little of the world. And though it was a thing to be lamented,\nyet when he and I should set about to reform mankind in this respect, we\nshould have enough upon our hands; for, he said, it was too common and\nfashionable a case to be withstood by a private clergyman or two: and\nthen he uttered some reflections upon the conduct of the present fathers\nof the church, in regard to the first personages of the realm, as a\njustification of his coldness on this score.\n\n'I represented the different circumstances of your affair; that other\nwomen lived evilly by their own consent, but to serve you, was to save\nan innocence that had but few examples; and then I shewed him your\nletter.\n\n'He said it was prettily written: and he was sorry for you; and that\nyour good intentions ought to be encouraged: But what, said he, would\nyou have me do, Mr. Williams? Why suppose, sir, said I, you give her\nshelter in your house, with your spouse and niece, till she can get to\nher friends.--What! and embroil myself with a man of Mr. B----'s power\nand fortune! No, not I, I'll assure you!--And I would have you consider\nwhat you are about. Besides, she owns, continued he, that he promises\nto do honourably by her; and her shyness will procure her good terns\nenough; for he is no covetous nor wicked gentleman, except in this case;\nand 'tis what all young gentlemen will do.\n\n'I am greatly concerned for him, I assure you: but I am not discouraged\nby this ill success, let what will come of it, if I can serve you.\n\n'I don't hear, as yet, that Mr. B---- is coming. I am glad of your hint\nas to that unhappy fellow John Arnold. Something, perhaps, will strike\nout from that, which may be useful. As to your packets, if you seal them\nup, and lay them in the usual place, if you find it not suspected, I\nwill watch an opportunity to convey them; but if they are large, you had\nbest be very cautious. This evil woman, I find, mistrusts me much.\n\n'I just hear, that the gentleman is dying, whose living Mr. B---- has\npromised me. I have almost a scruple to take it, as I am acting so\ncontrary to his desires: but I hope he will one day thank me for it. As\nto money, don't think of it at present. Be assured you may command all\nin my power to do for you without reserve.\n\n'I believe, when we hear he is coming, it will be best to make use of\nthe key, which I shall soon procure you; and I can borrow a horse for\nyou, I believe, to wait within half a mile of the back-door, over\nthe pasture; and will contrive, by myself, or somebody, to have you\nconducted some miles distant, to one of the villages thereabouts; so\ndon't be discomforted, I beseech you. I am, excellent Mrs. Pamela,\n\n                                           'Your faithful friend, etc.'\n\n\nI made a thousand sad reflections upon the former part of this honest\ngentleman's kind letter; and but for the hope he gave me at last, should\nhave given up my case as quite desperate. I then wrote to thank him most\ngratefully for his kind endeavours; to lament the little concern the\ngentry had for my deplorable case; the wickedness of the world, first\nto give way to such iniquitous fashions, and then plead the frequency of\nthem, against the attempt to amend them; and how unaffected people were\nwith the distresses of others. I recalled my former hint as to writing\nto Lady Davers, which I feared, I said, would only serve to apprise her\nbrother, that she knew his wicked scheme, and more harden him in it, and\nmake him come down the sooner, and to be the more determined on my\nruin; besides that it might make Mr. Williams guessed at, as a means\nof conveying my letter: And being very fearful, that if that good lady\nwould interest herself in my behalf, (which was a doubt, because she\nboth loved and feared her brother,) it would have no effect upon him;\nand that therefore I would wait the happy event I might hope for from\nhis kind assistance in the key, and the horse. I intimated my master's\nletter, begging to be permitted to come down: was fearful it might be\nsudden; and that I was of opinion no time was to be lost; for we might\nlet slip all our opportunities; telling him the money trick of this vile\nwoman, etc.\n\nI had not time to take a copy of this letter, I was so watched. And when\nI had it ready in my bosom, I was easy. And so I went to seek out Mrs.\nJewkes, and told her, I would have her advice upon the letter I had\nreceived from my master; which point of confidence in her pleased her\nnot a little. Ay, said she, now this is something like: and we'll take a\nturn in the garden, or where you please. I pretended it was indifferent\nto me; and so we walked into the garden. I began to talk to her of the\nletter; but was far from acquainting her with all the contents; only\nthat he wanted my consent to come down, and hoped she used me kindly,\nand the like. And I said, Now, Mrs. Jewkes, let me have your advice as\nto this. Why then, said she, I will give it you freely; E'en send to him\nto come down. It will highly oblige him, and I dare say you'll fare the\nbetter for it. How the better? said I.--I dare say, you think yourself,\nthat he intends my ruin. I hate, said she, that foolish word, your\nruin!--Why, ne'er a lady in the land may live happier than you if you\nwill, or be more honourably used.\n\nWell, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, I shall not, at this time, dispute with you\nabout the words ruin and honourable: for I find we have quite different\nnotions of both: But now I will speak plainer than ever I did. Do you\nthink he intends to make proposals to me as to a kept mistress, or kept\nslave rather, or do you not?--Why, lambkin, said she, what dost thou\nthink thyself?--I fear, said I, he does. Well, said she, but if he does,\n(for I know nothing of the matter, I assure you,) you may have your own\nterms--I see that; for you may do any thing with him.\n\nI could not bear this to be spoken, though it was all I feared of a long\ntime; and began to exclaim most sadly. Nay, said she, he may marry you,\nas far as I know.--No, no, said I, that cannot be.--I neither desire\nnor expect it. His condition don't permit me to have such a thought; and\nthat, and the whole series of his conduct, convinces me of the contrary;\nand you would have me invite him to come down, would you? Is not this to\ninvite my ruin?\n\n'Tis what I would do, said she, in your place; and if it was to be as\nyou think, I should rather be out of my pain, than live in continual\nfrights and apprehensions, as you do. No, replied I, an hour of\ninnocence is worth an age of guilt; and were my life to be made ever\nso miserable by it, I should never forgive myself, if I were not to\nlengthen out to the longest minute my happy time of honesty. Who knows\nwhat Providence may do for me!\n\nWhy, may be, said she, as he loves you so well, you may prevail upon him\nby your prayers and tears; and for that reason, I should think, you'd\nbetter let him come down. Well, said I, I will write him a letter,\nbecause he expects an answer, or may be he will make a pretence to come\ndown. How can it go?\n\nI'll take care of that, said she; it is in my instructions.--Ay, thought\nI, so I doubt, by the hint Mr. Williams gave me about the post-house.\n\nThe gardener coming by, I said, Mr. Jacob, I have planted a few beans,\nand I call the place my garden. It is just by the door out yonder: I'll\nshew it you; pray don't dig them up. So I went on with him; and when we\nhad turned the alley, out of her sight and were near the place said I,\nPray step to Mrs. Jewkes, and ask her if she has any more beans for\nme to plant? He smiled, I suppose at my foolishness; and I popped the\nletter under the mould, and stepped back, as if waiting for his return;\nwhich, being near, was immediate; and she followed him. What should I do\nwith beans? said she,--and sadly scared me; for she whispered me, I\nam afraid of some fetch! You don't use to send on such simple\nerrands.--What fetch? said I: It is hard I can neither stir, nor speak,\nbut I must be suspected.--Why, said she, my master writes, that I must\nhave all my eyes about me; for though you are as innocent as a dove, yet\nyou are as cunning as a serpent. But I'll forgive you, if you cheat me.\n\nThen I thought of my money, and could have called her names, had I\ndared: And I said, Pray Mrs. Jewkes, now you talk of forgiving me, if\nI cheat you, be so kind as to pay me my money; for though I have no\noccasion for it, yet I know you was but in jest, and intended to give it\nme again. You shall have it in a proper time, said she; but, indeed, I\nwas in earnest to get it out of your hands, for fear you should make an\nill use of it. And so we cavilled upon this subject as we walked in, and\nI went up to write my letter to my master; and, as I intended to shew\nit her, I resolved to write accordingly as to her part of it; for I made\nlittle account of his offer of Mrs. Jervis to me, instead of this wicked\nwoman, (though the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me,\nexcept my escape from hence,) nor indeed any thing he said. For to be\nhonourable, in the just sense of the word, he need not have caused me to\nbe run away with, and confined as I am. I wrote as follows:\n\n\n'HONOURED SIR,\n\n'When I consider how easily you might make me happy, since all I desire\nis to be permitted to go to my poor father and mother; when I reflect\nupon your former proposal to me in relation to a certain person, not one\nword of which is now mentioned; and upon my being in that strange manner\nrun away with, and still kept here a miserable prisoner; do you think,\nsir, (pardon your poor servant's freedom; my fears make me bold; do you\nthink, I say,) that your general assurances of honour to me, can have\nthe effect upon me, that, were it not for these things, all your words\nought to have?--O, good sir! I too much apprehend that your notions of\nhonour and mine are very different from one another: and I have no other\nhopes but in your continued absence. If you have any proposals to make\nme, that are consistent with your honourable professions, in my humble\nsense of the word, a few lines will communicate them to me, and I will\nreturn such an answer as befits me. But, oh! What proposals can one in\nyour high station have to make to one in my low one! I know what belongs\nto your degree too well, to imagine, that any thing can be expected but\nsad temptations, and utter distress, if you come down; and you know not,\nsir, when I am made desperate, what the wretched Pamela dares to do!\n\n'Whatever rashness you may impute to me, I cannot help it; but I wish\nI may not be forced upon any, that otherwise would never enter into my\nthoughts. Forgive me, sir, my plainness; I should be loath to behave to\nmy master unbecomingly; but I must needs say, sir, my innocence is so\ndear to me, that all other considerations are, and, I hope, shall ever\nbe, treated by me as niceties, that ought, for that, to be dispensed\nwith. If you mean honourably, why, sir, should you not let me know it\nplainly? Why is it necessary to imprison me, to convince me of it? And\nwhy must I be close watched, and attended, hindered from stirring out,\nfrom speaking to any body, from going so much as to church to pray for\nyou, who have been, till of late, so generous a benefactor to me? Why,\nsir, I humbly ask, why all this, if you mean honourably?--It is not for\nme to expostulate so freely, but in a case so near to me, with you, sir,\nso greatly my superior. Pardon me, I hope you will; but as to seeing\nyou, I cannot bear the dreadful apprehension. Whatever you have to\npropose, whatever you intend by me, let my assent be that of a free\nperson, mean as I am, and not of a sordid slave, who is to be threatened\nand frightened into a compliance with measures, which your conduct to\nher seems to imply would be otherwise abhorred by her.--My restraint is\nindeed hard upon me: I am very uneasy under it. Shorten it, I beseech\nyou, or--but I will not dare to say more, than that I am\n\n                              'Your greatly oppressed unhappy servant.'\n\n\nAfter I had taken a copy of this, I folded it up; and Mrs. Jewkes,\ncoming just as I had done, sat down by me; and said, when she saw me\ndirect it, I wish you would tell me if you have taken my advice, and\nconsented to my master's coming down. If it will oblige you, said I,\nI will read it to you. That's good, said she; then I'll love you\ndearly.--Said I, Then you must not offer to alter one word. I won't,\nreplied she. So I read it to her, and she praised me much for my wording\nit; but said she thought I pushed the matter very close; and it would\nbetter bear talking of, than writing about. She wanted an explanation\nor two, as about the proposal to a certain person; but I said, she\nmust take it as she heard it. Well, well, said she, I make no doubt you\nunderstand one another, and will do so more and more. I sealed up the\nletter, and she undertook to convey it.\n\n\nSunday.\n\nFor my part, I knew it in vain to expect to have leave to go to church\nnow, and so I did not ask; and I was the more indifferent, because, if I\nmight have had permission, the sight of the neighbouring gentry, who had\ndespised my sufferings, would have given me great regret and sorrow; and\nit was impossible I should have edified under any doctrine preached by\nMr. Peters: So I applied myself to my private devotions.\n\nMr. Williams came yesterday, and this day, as usual, and took my letter;\nbut, having no good opportunity, we avoided one another's conversation,\nand kept at a distance: But I was concerned I had not the key; for I\nwould not have lost a moment in that case, had I been he, and he I. When\nI was at my devotion, Mrs. Jewkes came up, and wanted me sadly to sing\nher a psalm, as she had often on common days importuned me for a song\nupon the spinnet: but I declined it, because my spirits were so low I\ncould hardly speak, nor cared to be spoken to; but when she was gone, I\nremembering the cxxxviith psalm to be a little touching, turned to it,\nand took the liberty to alter it, somewhat nearer to my case. I hope I\ndid not sin in it; but thus I turned it:\n\n              I.\n\n  When sad I sat in B----n Hall,\n    All guarded round about,\n  And thought of ev'ry absent friend,\n    The tears for grief burst out.\n\n             II.\n\n  My joys and hopes all overthrown,\n    My heart-strings almost broke,\n  Unfit my mind for melody,\n    Much more to bear a joke.\n\n            III.\n\n  Then she to whom I pris'ner was,\n    Said to me, tauntingly,\n  Now cheer your heart, and sing a song\n    And tune your mind to joy.\n\n             IV.\n\n  Alas! said I, how can I frame\n    My heavy heart to sing,\n  Or tune my mind, while thus enthrall'd\n    By such a wicked thing!\n\n              V.\n\n  But yet, if from my innocence\n    I, ev'n in thought, should slide,\n  Then let my fingers quite forget\n    The sweet spinnet to guide.\n\n             VI.\n\n  And let my tongue within my mouth\n    Be lock'd for ever fast,\n  If I rejoice, before I see\n    My full deliv'rance past.\n\n            VII.\n\n  And thou, Almighty, recompense\n    The evils I endure,\n  From those who seek my sad disgrace,\n    So causeless, to procure.\n\n           VIII.\n\n  Remember, Lord, this Mrs. Jewkes,\n    When, with a mighty sound,\n  She cries, Down with her chastity,\n    Down to the very ground!\n\n             IX.\n\n  Ev'n so shalt thou, O wicked one!\n    At length to shame be brought,\n  And happy shall all those be call'd\n    That my deliv'rance wrought.\n\n              X.\n\n  Yea, blessed shall the man be called\n    That shames thee of thy evil,\n  And saves me from thy vile attempts,\n    And thee, too, from the D---l.\n\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nI write now with a little more liking, though less opportunity, because\nMr. Williams has got a large parcel of my papers, safe in his hands,\nto send them to you, as he has opportunity; so I am not quite uselessly\nemployed: and I am delivered besides, from the fear of their being\nfound, if I should be searched, or discovered. I have been permitted to\ntake an airing, five or six miles, with Mrs. Jewkes: But, though I know\nnot the reason, she watches me more closely than ever; so that we\nhave discontinued, by consent, for these three days, the sunflower\ncorrespondence.\n\nThe poor cook-maid has had a bad mischance; for she has been hurt much\nby a bull in the pasture, by the side of the garden, not far from the\nback-door. Now this pasture I am to cross, which is about half a mile,\nand then is a common, and near that a private horse-road, where I hope\nto find an opportunity for escaping, as soon as Mr. Williams can get me\na horse, and has made all ready for me: for he has got me the key, which\nhe put under the mould, just by the door, as he found an opportunity to\nhint to me.\n\nHe just now has signified, that the gentleman is dead, whose living he\nhas had hope of; and he came pretendedly to tell Mrs. Jewkes of it; and\nso could speak this to her before me. She wished him joy. See what the\nworld is! One man's death is another man's joy. Thus we thrust out\none another!--My hard case makes me serious. He found means to slide\na letter into my hands, and is gone away: He looked at me with such\nrespect and solemness at parting, that Mrs. Jewkes said, Why, madam,\nI believe our young parson is half in love with you.--Ah! Mrs. Jewkes,\nsaid I, he knows better. Said she, (I believe to sound me,) Why, I can't\nsee you can either of you do better; and I have lately been so touched\nfor you, seeing how heavily you apprehend dishonour from my master, that\nI think it is pity you should not have Mr. Williams.\n\nI knew this must be a fetch of hers; because, instead of being troubled\nfor me, as she pretended, she watched me closer, and him too: and so I\nsaid, There is not the man living that I desire to marry. If I can\nbut keep myself honest, it is all my desire: And to be a comfort and\nassistance to my poor parents, if it should be my happy lot to be so, is\nthe very top of my ambition. Well, but, said she, I have been thinking\nvery seriously, that Mr. Williams would make you a good husband; and as\nhe will owe all his fortune to my master, he will be very glad, to be\nsure, to be obliged to him for a wife of his choosing: especially, said\nshe, such a pretty one, and one so ingenious, and genteelly educated.\n\nThis gave me a doubt, whether she knew of my master's intimation of that\nsort formerly; and I asked her, if she had reason to surmise that that\nwas in view? No, she said; it was only her own thought; but it was very\nlikely that my master had either that in view, or something better for\nme. But, if I approved of it, she would propose such a thing to\nher master directly; and gave a detestable hint, that I might take\nresolutions upon it, of bringing such an affair to effect. I told her I\nabhorred her vile insinuation; and as to Mr. Williams, I thought him a\ncivil good sort of man; but, as on one side, he was above me; so, on\nthe other, I said of all things I did not love a parson. So, finding\nshe could make nothing of me, she quitted the subject. I will open his\nletter by and by, and give you the contents of it; for she is up and\ndown so much, that I am afraid of her surprising me.\n\nWell, I see Providence has not abandoned me: I shall be under no\nnecessity to make advances to Mr. Williams, if I was (as I am sure I am\nnot) disposed to it. This is his letter:\n\n\n'I know not how to express myself, lest I should appear to you to have\na selfish view in the service I would do you. But I really know but one\neffectual and honourable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous\nsituation you are in. It is that of marriage with some person that you\ncould make happy in your approbation. As for my own part, it would be,\nas things stand, my apparent ruin; and, worse still, I should involve\nyou in misery too. But, yet, so great is my veneration for you, and\nso entire my reliance on Providence, upon so just an occasion, that I\nshould think myself but too happy, if I might be accepted. I would, in\nthis case, forego all my expectations, and be your conductor to some\nsafe distance. But why do I say, in this case? That I will do, whether\nyou think fit to reward me so eminently or not: And I will, the moment I\nhear of Mr. B----'s setting out, (and I think now I have settled a very\ngood method of intelligence of all his motions,) get a horse ready,\nand myself to conduct you. I refer myself wholly to your goodness and\ndirection; and am, with the highest respect,\n\n                             'Your most faithful humble servant.'\n\n'Don't think this a sudden resolution. I always admired your\nhear-say character; and the moment I saw you, wished to serve so much\nexcellence.'\n\n\nWhat shall I say, my dear father and mother, to this unexpected\ndeclaration? I want, now, more than ever, your blessing and direction.\nBut, after all, I have no mind to marry; I had rather live with you. But\nyet, I would marry a man who begs from door to door, and has no home nor\nbeing, rather than endanger my honesty. Yet I cannot, methinks, hear of\nbeing a wife.--After a thousand different thoughts, I wrote as follows:\n\n\n'REVEREND SIR,\n\n'I am greatly confused at the contents of your last. You are much too\ngenerous, and I can't bear you should risk all your future prospects\nfor so unworthy a creature. I cannot think of your offer without equal\nconcern and gratitude: for nothing, but to avoid my utter ruin, can make\nme think of a change of condition; and so, sir, you ought not to accept\nof such an involuntary compliance, as mine would be, were I, upon the\nlast necessity, to yield to your very generous proposal. I will rely\nwholly upon your goodness to me, in assisting my escape; but shall not,\non your account principally, think of the honour you propose for me at\npresent; and never, but at the pleasure of my parents; who, poor as they\nare, in such a weighty point, are as much entitled to my obedience and\nduty, as if they were ever so rich. I beg you, therefore, sir, not\nto think of any thing from me, but everlasting gratitude, which shall\nalways bind me to be 'Your most obliged servant.'\n\n\nThursday, Friday, Saturday, the 14th, 15th, and 16th, of my bondage.\n\nMrs. Jewkes has received a letter, and is much civiller to me, and Mr.\nWilliams too, than she used to be. I wonder I have not one in answer to\nmine to my master. I suppose I put the matter too home to him: and he\nis angry. I am not the more pleased with her civility; for she is horrid\ncunning, and is not a whit less watchful. I laid a trap to get at her\ninstructions, which she carries in the bosom of her stays; but it has\nnot succeeded.\n\nMy last letter is come safe to Mr. Williams by the old conveyance, so\nthat he is not suspected. He has intimated, that though I have not come\nso readily as he hoped into his scheme, yet his diligence shall not be\nslackened, and he will leave it to Providence and himself to dispose\nof him as he shall be found to deserve. He has signified to me, that he\nshall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you, and I have\nadded to it what has occurred since.\n\n\nSunday.\n\nI am just now quite astonished!--I hope all is right!--but I have a\nstrange turn to acquaint you with. Mr. Williams and Mrs. Jewkes came to\nme both together; he in ecstacies, she with a strange fluttering sort of\nair. Well, said she, Mrs. Pamela, I give you joy! I give you joy!--Let\nnobody speak but me! Then she sat down, as out of breath, puffing and\nblowing. Why, every thing turns as I said it would! said she: Why, there\nis to be a match between you and Mr. Williams! Well, I always thought\nit. Never was so good a master!--Go to, go to, naughty, mistrustful Mrs.\nPamela; nay, Mrs. Williams, said the forward creature, I may as good\ncall you: you ought on your knees to beg his pardon a thousand times for\nmistrusting him.\n\nShe was going on; but I said, Don't torture me thus, I beseech you,\nMrs. Jewkes. Let me know all!--Ah! Mr. Williams, said I, take care, take\ncare!--Mistrustful again! said she: Why, Mr. Williams, shew her your\nletter, and I will shew her mine: they were brought by the same hand.\n\nI trembled at the thoughts of what this might mean; and said, You have\nso surprised me, that I cannot stand, nor hear, nor read! Why did you\ncome up in such a manner to attack such weak spirits? said he, to Mrs.\nJewkes, Shall we leave our letters with Mrs. Pamela, and let her recover\nfrom her surprise? Ay, said she, with all my heart; here is nothing but\nflaming honour and good will! And so saying, they left me their letters\nand withdrew.\n\nMy heart was quite sick with the surprise, so that I could not\npresently read them, notwithstanding my impatience; but, after a while,\nrecovering, I found the contents thus strange and unexpected:\n\n\n'MR. WILLIAMS,\n\n'The death of Mr. Fownes has now given me the opportunity I have long\nwanted, to make you happy, and that in a double respect: For I shall\nsoon put you in possession of his living; and, if you have the art of\nmaking yourself well received, of one of the loveliest wives in England.\nShe has not been used (as she has reason to think) according to her\nmerit; but when she finds herself under the protection of a man of\nvirtue and probity, and a happy competency to support life in the manner\nto which she has been of late years accustomed, I am persuaded she will\nforgive those seeming hardships which have paved the way to so happy a\nlot, as I hope it will be to you both. I have only to account for and\nexcuse the odd conduct I have been guilty of, which I shall do when I\nsee you: but as I shall soon set out for London, I believe it will not\nbe yet this month. Mean time, if you can prevail with Pamela, you need\nnot suspend for that your mutual happiness; only let me have notice of\nit first, and that she approves of it; which ought to be, in so material\na point, entirely at her option; as I assure you, on the other hand,\nI would have it at yours, that nothing may be wanting to complete your\nhappiness.                                   'I am your humble servant.'\n\n\nWas ever the like heard?--Lie still, my throbbing heart, divided as\nthou art, between thy hopes and thy fears!--But this is the letter Mrs.\nJewkes left with me:\n\n\n'MRS. JEWKES,\n\n'You have been very careful and diligent in the task, which, for reasons\nI shall hereafter explain, I had imposed upon you. Your trouble is now\nalmost at an end; for I have written my intentions to Mr. Williams\nso particularly, that I need say the less here, because he will not\nscruple, I believe, to let you know the contents of my letter. I have\nonly one thing to mention, that if you find what I have hinted to him\nin the least measure disagreeable to either, you assure them both, that\nthey are at entire liberty to pursue their own inclinations. I hope you\ncontinue your civilities to the mistrustful, uneasy Pamela, who now will\nbegin to think better of hers and 'Your friend, etc.'\n\n\nI had hardly time to transcribe these letters, though, writing so much,\nI write pretty fast, before they both came up again in high spirits; and\nMr. Williams said, I am glad at my heart, madam, that I was beforehand\nin my declarations to you: this generous letter has made me the happiest\nman on earth; and, Mrs. Jewkes, you may be sure, that if I can procure\nthis fair one's consent, I shall think myself--I interrupted the good\nman, and said, Ah! Mr. Williams, take care, take care; don't let--There\nI stopt; and Mrs. Jewkes said, Still mistrustful!--I never saw the like\nin my life!--But I see, said she, I was not wrong, while my old orders\nlasted, to be wary of you both--I should have had a hard task to prevent\nyou, I find; for, as the saying is, Nought can restrain consent of\ntwain.\n\nI doubted not her taking hold of his joyful indiscretion.--I took her\nletter, and said, Here, Mrs. Jewkes, is yours; I thank you for it; but\nI have been so long in a maze, that I can say nothing of this for the\npresent. Time will bring all to light.--Sir, said I, here is yours:\nMay every thing turn to your happiness! I give you joy of my master's\ngoodness in the living.--It will be dying, said he, not a living,\nwithout you.--Forbear, sir, said I; while I have a father and mother, I\nam not my own mistress, poor as they are; and I'll see myself quite at\nliberty, before I shall think myself fit to make a choice.\n\nMrs. Jewkes held up her eyes and hands, and said, Such art, such\ncaution, such cunning, for thy years!--Well!--Why, said I, (that he\nmight be more on his guard, though I hope there cannot be deceit in\nthis; 'twould be strange villany, and that is a hard word, if there\nshould!) I have been so used to be made a fool of by fortune, that I\nhardly can tell how to govern myself; and am almost an infidel as to\nmankind. But I hope I may be wrong; henceforth, Mrs. Jewkes, you shall\nregulate my opinions as you please, and I will consult you in every\nthing--(that I think proper, said I to myself)--for, to be sure, though\nI may forgive her, I can never love her.\n\nShe left Mr. Williams and me, a few minutes, together; and I said,\nConsider, sir, consider what you have done. 'Tis impossible, said he,\nthere can be deceit. I hope so, said I; but what necessity was there\nfor you to talk of your former declaration? Let this be as it will, that\ncould do no good, especially before this woman. Forgive me, sir; they\ntalk of women's promptness of speech; but, indeed, I see an honest heart\nis not always to be trusted with itself in bad company.\n\nHe was going to reply, but though her task is said to be ALMOST (I took\nnotice of that word) at an end, she came up to us again, and said; Well,\nI had a good mind to show you the way to church to-morrow. I was glad of\nthis, because, though in my present doubtful situation I should not have\nchosen it, yet I would have encouraged her proposal, to be able to judge\nby her being in earnest or otherwise, whether one might depend upon the\nrest. But Mr. Williams again indiscreetly helped her to an excuse, by\nsaying, that it was now best to defer it one Sunday, and till matters\nwere riper for my appearance: and she readily took hold of it, and\nconfirmed his opinion.\n\nAfter all, I hope the best: but if this should turn out to be a plot,\nI fear nothing but a miracle can save me. But, sure the heart of man is\nnot capable of such black deceit. Besides, Mr. Williams has it under his\nown hand, and he dare not but be in earnest: and then again, though to\nbe sure he has been very wrong to me, yet his education, and parents'\nexample, have neither of them taught him such very black contrivances.\nSo I will hope for the best.\n\n\nMr. Williams, Mrs. Jewkes, and I, have been all three walking together\nin the garden; and she pulled out her key, and we walked a little in the\npasture to look at the bull, an ugly, grim, surly creature, that hurt\nthe poor cook-maid; who is got pretty well again. Mr. Williams pointed\nat the sunflower, but I was forced to be very reserved to him; for the\npoor gentleman has no guard, no caution at all.\n\nWe have just supped together, all three: and I cannot yet think that all\nmust be right.--Only I am resolved not to marry, if I can help it; and I\nwill give no encouragement, I am resolved, at least, till I am with you.\n\nMr. Williams said, before Mrs. Jewkes, he would send a messenger with\na letter to my father and mother.--I think the man has no discretion\nin the world: but l desire you will send no answer, till I have the\npleasure and happiness which now I hope for soon, of seeing you. He\nwill, in sending my packet, send a most tedious parcel of stuff, of my\noppressions, my distresses, my fears; and so I will send this with it;\n(for Mrs. Jewkes gives me leave to send a letter to my father, which\nlooks well;) and I am glad I can conclude, after all my sufferings, with\nmy hopes, to be soon with you, which I know will give you comfort; and\nso I rest, begging the continuance of your prayers and blessings,\n\n                                     Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER.\n\n\nMY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,\n\nI have so much time upon my hands that I must write on, to employ\nmyself. The Sunday evening, where I left off, Mrs. Jewkes asked me, If\nI chose to be by myself; I said, Yes, with all my heart, if she pleased.\nWell, said she, after to-night you shall. I asked her for more paper;\nand she gave me a bottle of ink, eight sheets of paper, which she said\nwas all her store, (for now she would get me to write for her to our\nmaster, if she had occasion,) and six pens, with a piece of sealing wax.\nThis looks mighty well.\n\nShe pressed me, when she came to bed, very much, to give encouragement\nto Mr. Williams, and said many things in his behalf; and blamed my\nshyness to him. I told her, I was resolved to give no encouragement,\ntill I had talked to my father and mother. She said, he fancied I\nthought of somebody else, or I could never be so insensible. I assured\nher, as I could do very safely, that there was not a man on earth I\nwished to have: and as to Mr. Williams, he might do better by far: and I\nhad proposed so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother,\nthat I could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure, till I had\ntried that. I asked her for my money; and she said, it was above in her\nstrong box, but that I should have it to-morrow. All these things look\nwell, as I said.\n\nMr. Williams would go home this night, though late, because he would\ndespatch a messenger to you with a letter he had proposed from himself,\nand my packet. But pray don't encourage him, as I said; for he is much\ntoo heady and precipitate as to this matter, in my way of thinking;\nthough, to be sure, he is a very good man, and I am much obliged to him.\n\n\nMonday morning.\n\nAlas-a-day! we have bad news from poor Mr. Williams. He has had a sad\nmischance; fallen among rogues in his way home last night: but by good\nchance has saved my papers. This is the account he gives of it to Mrs.\nJewkes:\n\n\n'GOOD MRS. JEWKES,\n\n'I have had a sore misfortune in going from you. When I had got as\nnear the town as the dam, and was going to cross the wooden bridge, two\nfellows got hold of me, and swore bitterly they would kill me, if I did\nnot give them what I had. They rummaged my pockets, and took from me\nmy snuff-box, my seal-ring, and half a guinea, and some silver, and\nhalfpence; also my handkerchief, and two or three letters I had in\nmy pockets. By good fortune, the letter Mrs. Pamela gave me was in\nmy bosom, and so that escaped but they bruised my head and face, and\ncursing me for having no more money, tipped me into the dam, crying, be\nthere, parson, till to-morrow! My shins and knees were bruised much\nin the fall against one of the stumps; and I had like to have been\nsuffocated in water and mud. To be sure, I shan't be able to stir out\nthis day or two: for I am a frightful spectacle! My hat and wig I was\nforced to leave behind me, and go home, a mile and a half, without; but\nthey were found next morning, and brought me, with my snuff-box, which\nthe rogues must have dropped. My cassock is sadly torn, as is my band.\nTo be sure, I was much frightened, for a robbery in these parts has not\nbeen known many years. Diligent search is making after the rogues. My\nhumble respects to good Mrs. Pamela: if she pities my misfortunes, I\nshall be the sooner well, and fit to wait on her and you. This did not\nhinder me in writing a letter, though with great pain, as I do this, (To\nbe sure this good man can keep no secret!) and sending it away by a man\nand horse, this morning. I am, good Mrs. Jewkes,\n\n                            'Your most obliged humble servant.'\n\n'God be praised it is no worse! And I find I have got no cold, though\nmiserably wet from top to toe. My fright, I believe, prevented me from\ncatching cold: for I was not rightly myself for some hours, and know\nnot how I got home. I will write a letter of thanks this night, if I am\nable, to my kind patron, for his inestimable goodness to me. I wish I\nwas enabled to say all I hope, with regard to the better part of his\nbounty to me, incomparable Mrs. Pamela.'\n\n\nThe wicked brute fell a laughing, when she had read this letter, till\nher fat sides shook. Said she, I can but think how the poor parson\nlooked, after parting with his pretty mistress in such high spirits,\nwhen he found himself at the bottom of the dam! And what a figure he\nmust cut in his tattered band and cassock, and without a hat and wig,\nwhen he got home. I warrant, added she, he was in a sweet pickle!--I\nsaid, I thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune; but\nshe replied, As he was safe, she laughed; otherwise she would have\nbeen sorry: and she was glad to see me so concerned for him--It looked\npromising, she said.\n\nI heeded not her reflections; but as I have been used to causes for\nmistrusts, I cannot help saying, that I don't like this thing: And their\ntaking his letters most alarms me.--How happy it was they missed my\npacket! I knew not what to think of it!--But why should I let every\naccident break my peace? Yet it will do so, while I stay here.\n\nMrs. Jewkes is mightily at me, to go with her in the chariot, to visit\nMr. Williams. She is so officious to bring on the affair between us,\nthat, being a cunning, artful woman, I know not what to make of it: I\nhave refused her absolutely; urging, that except I intended to encourage\nhis suit, I ought not to do it. And she is gone without me.\n\nI have strange temptations to get away in her absence, for all these\nfine appearances. 'Tis sad to have nobody to advise with!--I know not\nwhat to do. But, alas for me! I have no money, if I should, to buy any\nbody's civilities, or to pay for necessaries or lodgings. But I'll go\ninto the garden, and resolve afterwards----\n\n\nI have been in the garden, and to the back-door: and there I stood, my\nheart up at my mouth. I could not see I was watched; so this looks\nwell. But if any thing should go bad afterwards, I should never forgive\nmyself, for not taking this opportunity. Well, I will go down again,\nand see if all is clear, and how it looks out at the back-door in the\npasture.\n\n\nTo be sure, there is witchcraft in this house; and I believe Lucifer is\nbribed, as well as all about me, and is got into the shape of that nasty\ngrim bull to watch me!--For I have been again, and ventured to open the\ndoor, and went out about a bow-shot into the pasture; but there stood\nthat horrid bull, staring me full in the face, with fiery saucer eyes,\nas I thought. So I got in again, for fear he should come at me. Nobody\nsaw me, however.--Do you think there are such things as witches and\nspirits? If there be, I believe, in my heart, Mrs. Jewkes has got\nthis bull of her side. But yet, what could I do without money, or a\nfriend'--O this wicked woman! to trick me so! Every thing, man, woman,\nand beast, is in a plot against your poor Pamela, I think!--Then I\nknow not one step of the way, nor how far to any house or cottage;\nand whether I could gain protection, if I got to a house: And now the\nrobbers are abroad too, I may run into as great danger as I want to\nescape; nay, greater much, if these promising appearances hold: And sure\nmy master cannot be so black as that they should not!--What can I do?--I\nhave a good mind to try for it once more; but then I may be pursued and\ntaken: and it will be worse for me; and this wicked woman will beat me,\nand take my shoes away, and lock me up.\n\nBut, after all, if my master should mean well, he can't be angry at\nmy fears, if I should escape; and nobody can blame me; and I can more\neasily be induced, with you, when all my apprehensions are over,\nto consider his proposal of Mr. Williams, than I could here; and he\npretends, as you have read in his letter, he will leave me to my choice:\nWhy then should I be afraid? I will go down again, I think! But yet my\nheart misgives me, because of the difficulties before me, in escaping;\nand being so poor and so friendless!--O good God! the preserver of the\ninnocent! direct me what to do!\n\nWell, I have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me, that I\nought to try to get way, and leave the issue to Providence. So, once\nmore--I'll see, at least, if this bull be still there.\n\n\nAlack-a-day! what a fate is this! I have not the courage to go, neither\ncan I think to stay. But I must resolve. The gardener was in sight last\ntime; so made me come up again. But I'll contrive to send him out of the\nway, if I can:--For if I never should have such another opportunity,\nI could not forgive myself. Once more I'll venture. God direct my\nfootsteps, and make smooth my path and my way to safety!\n\n\nWell, here I am, come back again! frightened, like a fool, out of all my\npurposes! O how terrible every thing appears to me! I had got twice as\nfar again, as I was before, out of the back-door: and I looked and saw\nthe bull, as I thought, between me and the door; and another bull coming\ntowards me the other way: Well, thought I, here is double witchcraft, to\nbe sure! Here is the spirit of my master in one bull, and Mrs. Jewkes's\nin the other. And now I am gone, to be sure! O help! cried I, like a\nfool, and ran back to the door, as swift as if I flew. When I had got\nthe door in my hand, I ventured to look back, to see if these supposed\nbulls were coming; and I saw they were only two poor cows, a grazing in\ndistant places, that my fears had made all this rout about. But as every\nthing is so frightful to me, I find I am not fit to think of my escape:\nfor I shall be as much frightened at the first strange man that I meet\nwith: and I am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers, than\nthe caution, that goes along with it, delivers one from.\n\nI then locked the door, and put the key in my pocket, and was in a sad\nquandary; but I was soon determined; for the maid Nan came in sight,\nand asked, if any thing was the matter, that I was so often up and down\nstairs? God forgive me, (but I had a sad lie at my tongue's end,) said\nI; Though Mrs. Jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me, yet I know not\nwhere I am without her: I go up, and I come down to walk about in the\ngarden; and, not having her, know scarcely what to do with myself. Ay,\nsaid the ideot, she is main good company, madam, no wonder you miss her.\n\n\nSo here I am again, and here likely to be; for I have no courage to help\nmyself any where else. O why are poor foolish maidens tried with such\ndangers, when they have such weak minds to grapple with them!--I\nwill, since it is so, hope the best: but yet I cannot but observe how\ngrievously every thing makes against me: for here are the robbers;\nthough I fell not into their hands myself, yet they gave me as much\nterror, and had as great an effect upon my fears, as if I had: And here\nis the bull; it has as effectually frightened me, as if I had been hurt\nby it instead of the cook-maid; and so these joined together, as I may\nsay, to make a very dastard of me. But my folly was the worst of all,\nbecause that deprived me of my money: for had I had that, I believe I\nshould have ventured both the bull and the robbers.\n\n\nMonday afternoon.\n\nSo, Mrs. Jewkes is returned from her visit: Well, said she, I would have\nyou set your heart at rest; for Mr. Williams will do very well again. He\nis not half so bad as he fancied. O these scholars, said she, they have\nnot the hearts of mice! He has only a few scratches on his face; which,\nsaid she, I suppose he got by grappling among the gravel at the bottom\nof the dam, to try to find a hole in the ground, to hide himself from\nthe robbers. His shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to ail any\nthing. He says in his letter, he was a frightful spectacle: He might be\nso, indeed, when he first came in a doors; but he looks well enough now:\nand, only for a few groans now and then, when he thinks of his danger,\nI see nothing is the matter with him. So, Mrs. Pamela, said she, I would\nhave you be very easy about it. I am glad of it, said I, for all your\njokes, to Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nWell, said she, he talks of nothing but you: and when I told him I would\nfain have persuaded you to come with me, the man was out of his wits\nwith his gratitude to me: and so has laid open all his heart to me, and\ntold me all that has passed, and was contriving between you two. This\nalarmed me prodigiously; and the rather, as I saw, by two or three\ninstances, that his honest heart could keep nothing, believing every one\nas undesigning as himself. I said, but yet with a heavy heart, Ah! Mrs.\nJewkes, Mrs. Jewkes, this might have done with me, had he had any thing\nthat he could have told you of. But you know well enough, that had we\nbeen disposed, we had no opportunity for it, from your watchful care and\ncircumspection. No, said she, that's very true, Mrs. Pamela; not so\nmuch as for that declaration that he owned before me, he had found\nopportunity, for all my watchfulness, to make you. Come, come, said she,\nno more of these shams with me! You have an excellent head-piece for\nyour years; but may be I am as cunning as you.--However, said she,\nall is well now; because my watchments are now over, by my master's\ndirection. How have you employed yourself in my absence?\n\nI was so troubled at what might have passed between Mr. Williams and\nher, that I could not hide it; and she said, Well, Mrs. Pamela, since\nall matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended, let me advise\nyou to be a little less concerned at his discoveries; and make me your\nconfidant, as he has done, and I shall think you have some favour for\nme, and reliance upon me; and perhaps you might not repent it.\n\nShe was so earnest, that I mistrusted she did this to pump me; and I\nknew how, now, to account for her kindness to Mr. Williams in her visit\nto him; which was only to get out of him what she could. Why, Mrs.\nJewkes, said I, is all this fishing about for something, where there\nis nothing, if there be an end of your watchments, as you call them?\nNothing, said she, but womanish curiosity, I'll assure you; for one is\nnaturally led to find out matters, where there is such privacy intended.\nWell, said I, pray let me know what he has said; and then I'll give you\nan answer to your curiosity. I don't care, said she, whether you do or\nnot for I have as much as I wanted from him; and I despair of getting\nout of you any thing you ha'n't a mind I should know, my little cunning\ndear.--Well, said I, let him have said what he would, I care not: for I\nam sure he can say no harm of me; and so let us change the talk.\n\nI was the easier, indeed, because, for all her pumps, she gave no hints\nof the key and the door, etc. which, had he communicated to her, she\nwould not have forborne giving me a touch of.--And so we gave up one\nanother, as despairing to gain our ends of each other. But I am sure he\nmust have said more than he should.--And I am the more apprehensive all\nis not right, because she has now been actually, these two hours, shut\nup a writing; though she pretended she had given me up all her stores\nof papers, etc. and that I should write for her. I begin to wish I had\nventured every thing and gone off, when I might. O when will this state\nof doubt and uneasiness end!\n\n\nShe has just been with me, and says she shall send a messenger to\nBedfordshire; and he shall carry a letter of thanks for me, if I will\nwrite it for my master's favour to me. Indeed, said I, I have no thanks\nto give, till I am with my father and mother: and besides, I sent a\nletter, as you know; but have had no answer to it. She said, she thought\nthat his letter to Mr. Williams was sufficient; and the least I could\ndo was to thank him, if but in two lines. No need of it, said I; for I\ndon't intend to have Mr. Williams: What then is that letter to me? Well,\nsaid she, I see thou art quite unfathomable!\n\nI don't like all this. O my foolish fears of bulls and robbers!--For now\nall my uneasiness begins to double upon me. O what has this incautious\nman said! That, no doubt, is the subject of her long letter.\n\nI will close this day's writing, with just saying, that she is mighty\nsilent and reserved, to what she was: and says nothing but No, or Yes,\nto what I ask. Something must be hatching, I doubt!--I the rather think\nso, because I find she does not keep her word with me, about lying\nby myself, and my money; to both which points she returned suspicious\nanswers, saying, as to the one, Why, you are mighty earnest for your\nmoney; I shan't run away with it. And to the other, Good-lack! you need\nnot be so willing, as I know of, to part with me for a bed-fellow, till\nyou are sure of one you like better. This cut me to the heart; and, at\nthe same time, stopped my mouth.\n\n\nTuesday, Wednesday.\n\nMr. Williams has been here; but we have had no opportunity to talk\ntogether: He seemed confounded at Mrs. Jewkes's change of temper, and\nreservedness, after her kind visit, and their freedom with one another,\nand much more at what I am going to tell you. He asked, If I would take\na turn in the garden with Mrs. Jewkes and him. No, said she, I can't go.\nSaid he, May not Mrs. Pamela take a walk?--No, said she; I desire she\nwon't. Why, Mrs. Jewkes? said he: I am afraid I have somehow disobliged\nyou. Not at all, replied she; but I suppose you will soon be at liberty\nto walk together as much as you please: and I have sent a messenger for\nmy last instructions, about this and more weighty matters; and when they\ncome I shall leave you to do as you both will; but, till then, it is no\nmatter how little you are together. This alarmed us both; and he seemed\nquite struck of a heap, and put on, as I thought, a self-accusing\ncountenance. So I went behind her back, and held my two hands together,\nflat, with a bit of paper, I had, between them, and looked at him:\nand he seemed to take me as I intended; intimating the renewing of the\ncorrespondence by the tiles.\n\nI left them both together, and retired to my closet to write a letter\nfor the tiles; but having no time for a copy, I will give you the\nsubstance only.\n\nI expostulated with him on his too great openness and easiness to fall\ninto Mrs. Jewkes's snares: told him my apprehensions of foul play; and\ngave briefly the reasons which moved me: begged to know what he had\nsaid; and intimated, that I thought there was the highest reason to\nresume our prospect of the escape by the back-door. I put this in the\nusual place in the evening; and now wait with impatience for an answer.\n\n\nThursday.\n\nI have the following answer:\n\n\n'DEAREST MADAM,\n\n'I am utterly confounded, and must plead guilty to all your just\nreproaches. I wish I were master of all but half your caution and\ndiscretion! I hope, after all, this is only a touch of this ill woman's\ntemper, to shew her power and importance: For I think Mr. B---- neither\ncan nor dare deceive me in so black a manner. I would expose him all the\nworld over if he did. But it is not, cannot be in him. I have received\na letter from John Arnold, in which he tells me, that his master is\npreparing for his London journey; and believes, afterwards, he will come\ninto these parts: But he says, Lady Davers is at their house, and is to\naccompany her brother to London, or meet him there, he knows not which.\nHe professes great zeal and affection to your service: and I find he\nrefers to a letter he sent me before, but which is not come to my hand.\nI think there can be no treachery; for it is a particular friend at\nGainsborough, that I have ordered him to direct to; and this is come\nsafe to my hands by this means; for well I know, I durst trust nothing\nto Brett, at the post-house here. This gives me a little pain; but I\nhope all will end well, and we shall soon hear, if it be necessary to\npursue our former intentions. If it be, I will lose no time to provide a\nhorse for you, and another for myself; for I can never do either God or\nmyself better service, though I were to forego all my expectations for\nit here, I am 'Your most faithful humble servant.'\n\n'I was too free indeed with Mrs. Jewkes, led to it by her dissimulation,\nand by her pretended concern to make me happy with you. I hinted, that I\nwould not have scrupled to have procured your deliverance by any means;\nand that I had proposed to you, as the only honourable one, marriage\nwith me. But I assured her, though she would hardly believe me, that\nyou discouraged my application: which is too true! But not a word of the\nback-door key, etc.'\n\n\nMrs. Jewkes continues still sullen and ill-natured, and I am almost\nafraid to speak to her. She watches me as close as ever, and pretends to\nwonder why I shun her company as I do.\n\nI have just put under the tiles these lines inspired by my fears, which\nare indeed very strong; and, I doubt, not without reason.\n\n\n'SIR,\n\n'Every thing gives me additional disturbance. The missed letter of John\nArnold's makes me suspect a plot. Yet am I loath to think myself of so\nmuch importance, as to suppose every one in a plot against me. Are you\nsure, however, the London journey is not to be a Lincolnshire one? May\nnot John, who has been once a traitor, be so again?--Why need I be thus\nin doubt?--If I could have this horse, I would turn the reins on his\nneck, and trust to Providence to guide him for my safeguard! For I would\nnot endanger you, now just upon the edge of your preferment. Yet, sir, I\nfear your fatal openness will make you suspected as accessary, let us be\never so cautious.\n\n'Were my life in question, instead of my honesty, I would not wish to\ninvolve you, or any body, in the least difficulty, for so worthless a\npoor creature. But, O sir! my soul is of equal importance with the soul\nof a princess; though my quality is inferior to that of the meanest\nslave.\n\n'Save then my innocence, good Heaven! and preserve my mind spotless; and\nhappy shall I be to lay down my worthless life; and see an end to all my\ntroubles and anxieties.\n\n'Forgive my impatience: But my presaging mind bodes horrid mischiefs!\nEvery thing looks dark around me; and this woman's impenetrable\nsullenness and silence, without any apparent reason, from a conduct so\nvery contrary, bid me fear the worst.--blame me, sir, if you think me\nwrong; and let me have your advice what to do; which will oblige\n\n                                        'Your most afflicted servant.'\n\n\nFriday.\n\nI have this half-angry answer; but, what is more to me than all the\nletters in the world could be, yours, my dear father, enclosed.\n\n'MADAM,\n\n'I think you are too apprehensive by much; I am sorry for your\nuneasiness. You may depend upon me, and all I can do. But I make no\ndoubt of the London journey, nor of John's contrition and fidelity.\nI have just received, from my Gainsborough friend, this letter, as I\nsuppose, from your good father, in a cover, directed for me, as I had\ndesired. I hope it contains nothing to add to your uneasiness. Pray,\ndearest madam, lay aside your fears, and wait a few days for the issue\nof Mrs. Jewkes's letter, and mine of thanks to Mr. B----. Things, I\nhope, must be better than you expect. Providence will not desert such\npiety and innocence: and be this your comfort and reliance: Which is the\nbest advice that can at present be given, by\n\n                              'Your most faithful humble servant.'\n\n\nN. B. The father's letter was as follows:\n\n\n'My DEAREST DAUGHTER,\n\n'Our prayers are at length heard, and we are overwhelmed with joy. O\nwhat sufferings, what trials, hast thou gone through! Blessed be\nthe Divine goodness, which has enabled thee to withstand so many\ntemptations! We have not yet had leisure to read through your long\naccounts of all your hardships. I say long, because I wonder how you\ncould find time and opportunity for them: but otherwise they are the\ndelight of our spare hours; and we shall read them over and over, as\nlong as we live, with thankfulness to God, who has given us so virtuous\nand so discreet a daughter. How happy is our lot in the midst of our\npoverty! O let none ever think children a burden to them; when the\npoorest circumstances can produce so much riches in a Pamela! Persist,\nmy dear daughter, in the same excellent course; and we shall not envy\nthe highest estate, but defy them to produce such a daughter as ours.\n\n'I said, we had not read through all yours in course. We were too\nimpatient, and so turned to the end; where we find your virtue within\nview of its reward, and your master's heart turned to see the folly of\nhis ways, and the injury he had intended to our dear child: For, to be\nsure, my dear, he would have ruined you, if he could. But seeing your\nvirtue, his heart is touched; and he has, no doubt, been awakened by\nyour good example.\n\n'We don't see that you can do any way so well, as to come into the\npresent proposal, and make Mr. Williams, the worthy Mr. Williams! God\nbless him!--happy. And though we are poor, and can add no merit, no\nreputation, no fortune, to our dear child, but rather must be a disgrace\nto her, as the world will think; yet I hope I do not sin in my pride, to\nsay, that there is no good man, of a common degree, (especially as your\nlate lady's kindness gave you such good opportunities, which you have\nhad the grace to improve,) but may think himself happy in you. But, as\nyou say, you had rather not marry at present, far be it from us to offer\nviolence to your inclination! So much prudence as you have shewn in all\nyour conduct, would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this, or\nto offer to direct you in your choice. But, alas! my child, what can we\ndo for you?--To partake our hard lot, and involve yourself into as hard\na life, would not help us, but add to your afflictions. But it will be\ntime enough to talk of these things, when we have the pleasure you now\nput us in hope of, of seeing you with us; which God grant. Amen, amen,\nsay 'Your most indulgent parents. Amen!'\n\n'Our humblest service and thanks to the worthy Mr. Williams. Again we\nsay, God bless him for ever!\n\n'O what a deal we have to say to you! God give us a happy meeting!\nWe understand the 'squire is setting out for London. He is a fine\ngentleman, and has wit at will. I wish he was as good. But I hope he\nwill now reform.'\n\n\nO what inexpressible comfort, my dear father, has your letter given\nme!--You ask, What can you do for me?--What is it you cannot do for your\nchild!--You can give her the advice she has so much wanted, and still\nwants, and will always want: You can confirm her in the paths of virtue,\ninto which you first initiated her; and you can pray for her, with\nhearts so sincere and pure, that are not to be met with in palaces!--Oh!\nhow I long to throw myself at your feet, and receive from your own lips\nthe blessings of such good parents! But, alas! how are my prospects\nagain overclouded, to what they were when I closed my last parcel!--More\ntrials, more dangers, I fear, must your poor Pamela be engaged in: But\nthrough the Divine goodness, and your prayers, I hope, at last, to get\nwell out of all my difficulties; and the rather, as they are not the\neffect of my own vanity or presumption!\n\nBut I will proceed with my hopeless story. I saw Mr. Williams was a\nlittle nettled at my impatience; and so I wrote to assure him I would be\nas easy as I could, and wholly directed by him; especially as my father,\nwhose respects I mentioned, had assured me my master was setting out for\nLondon, which he must have somehow from his own family or he would not\nhave written me word of it.\n\n\nSaturday, Sunday.\n\nMr. Williams has been here both these days, as usual; but is very\nindifferently received still by Mrs. Jewkes; and, to avoid suspicion,\nI left them together, and went up to my closet, most of the time he was\nhere. He and she, I found by her, had a quarrel: and she seems quite out\nof humour with him: but I thought it best not to say any thing: and he\nsaid, he would very little trouble the house till he had an answer to\nhis letter from Mr. B----. And she returned, The less, the better.\nPoor man! he has got but little by his openness, making Mrs. Jewkes his\nconfidant, as she bragged, and would have had me to do likewise.\n\nI am more and more satisfied there is mischief brewing; and shall begin\nto hide my papers, and be circumspect. She seems mighty impatient for an\nanswer to her letter to my master.\n\n\nMonday, Tuesday, the 25th and 26th days of my heavy restraint.\n\nStill more and more strange things to write! A messenger is returned,\nand now all is out! O wretched, wretched Pamela! What, at last, will\nbecome of me!--Such strange turns and trials sure never poor creature,\nof my years, experienced. He brought two letters, one to Mrs. Jewkes,\nand one to me: but, as the greatest wits may be sometimes mistaken, they\nbeing folded and sealed alike, that for me was directed to Mrs.\nJewkes; and that for her was directed to me. But both are stark naught,\nabominably bad! She brought me up that directed for me, and said,\nHere's a letter for you: Long-looked-for is come at last. I will ask the\nmessenger a few questions, and then I will read mine. So she went down,\nand I broke it open in my closet, and found it directed To MRS. PAMELA\nANDREWS. But when I opened it, it began, Mrs. Jewkes. I was quite\nconfounded; but, thought I, this may be a lucky mistake; I may discover\nsomething: And so I read on these horrid contents:\n\n\n'MRS. JEWKES,\n\n'What you write me, has given me no small disturbance. This wretched\nfool's play-thing, no doubt, is ready to leap at any thing that offers,\nrather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefits\nshe has received from my family, and which I was determined more and\nmore to heap upon her. I reserve her for my future resentment; and I\ncharge you double your diligence in watching her, to prevent her escape.\nI send this by an honest Swiss, who attended me in my travels; a man I\ncan trust; and so let him be your assistant: for the artful creature is\nenough to corrupt a nation by her seeming innocence and simplicity; and\nshe may have got a party, perhaps, among my servants with you, as she\nhas here. Even John Arnold, whom I confided in, and favoured more than\nany, has proved an execrable villain; and shall meet his reward for it.\n\n'As to that college novice, Williams, I need not bid you take care\nhe sees not this painted bauble: for I have ordered Mr. Shorter, my\nattorney, to throw him instantly into gaol, on an action of debt, for\nmoney he has had of me, which I had intended never to carry to account\nagainst him; for I know all his rascally practices, besides what you\nwrite me of his perfidious intrigue with that girl, and his acknowledged\ncontrivances for her escape; when he knew not, for certain, that I\ndesigned her any mischief; and when, if he had been guided by a sense\nof piety, or compassion for injured innocence, as he pretends, he would\nhave expostulated with me, as his function, and my friendship for him,\nmight have allowed him. But to enter into a vile intrigue with the\namiable gewgaw, to favour her escape in so base a manner, (to say\nnothing of his disgraceful practices against me, in Sir Simon Darnford's\nfamily, of which Sir Simon himself has informed me), is a conduct that,\ninstead of preferring the ungrateful wretch, as I had intended, shall\npull down upon him utter ruin.\n\n'Monsieur Colbrand, my trusty Swiss, will obey you without reserve, if\nmy other servants refuse.\n\n'As for her denying that she encouraged his declaration, I believe\nit not. It is certain the speaking picture, with all that pretended\ninnocence and bashfulness, would have run away with him. Yes, she would\nrun away with a fellow that she had been acquainted with (and that not\nintimately, if you were as careful as you ought to be) but a few days;\nat a time when she had the strongest assurances of my honour to her.\n\n'Well, I think, I now hate her perfectly: and though I will do nothing\nto her myself, yet I can bear, for the sake of my revenge, and my\ninjured honour and slighted love, to see any thing, even what she most\nfears, be done to her; and then she may be turned loose to her evil\ndestiny, and echo to the woods and groves her piteous lamentations for\nthe loss of her fantastical innocence, which the romantic ideot makes\nsuch a work about. I shall go to London, with my sister Davers; and the\nmoment I can disengage myself, which, perhaps, may be in three weeks\nfrom this time, I will be with you, and decide her fate, and put an end\nto your trouble. Mean time be doubly careful; for this innocent, as I\nhave warned you, is full of contrivances. I am 'Your friend.'\n\n\nI had but just read this dreadful letter through, when Mrs. Jewkes\ncame up in a great fright, guessing at the mistake, and that I had her\nletter, and she found me with it open in my hand, just sinking away.\nWhat business, said she, had you to read my letter? and snatched it from\nme. You see, said she, looking upon it, it says Mrs. Jewkes, at top:\nYou ought, in manners, to have read no further. O add not, said I, to my\nafflictions! I shall be soon out of all your ways! This is too much! too\nmuch! I never can support this--and threw myself upon the couch, in my\ncloset, and wept most bitterly. She read it in the next room, and came\nin again afterwards. Why, this, said she, is a sad letter indeed: I am\nsorry for it: But I feared you would carry your niceties too far!--Leave\nme, leave me, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, for a while: I cannot speak nor\ntalk.--Poor heart! said she; Well, I'll come up again presently, and\nhope to find you better. But here, take your own letter; I wish you\nwell; but this is a sad mistake! And so she put down by me that which\nwas intended for me: But I have no spirit to read it at present. O man!\nman! hard-hearted, cruel man! what mischiefs art thou not capable of,\nunrelenting persecutor as thou art!\n\nI sat ruminating, when I had a little come to myself, upon the terms of\nthis wicked letter; and had no inclination to look into my own. The\nbad names, fool's play-thing, artful creature, painted bauble, gewgaw,\nspeaking picture, are hard words for your poor Pamela! and I began to\nthink whether I was not indeed a very naughty body, and had not done\nvile things: But when I thought of his having discovered poor John, and\nof Sir Simon's base officiousness, in telling him of Mr. Williams, with\nwhat he had resolved against him in revenge for his goodness to me, I\nwas quite dispirited; and yet still more about that fearful Colbrand,\nand what he could see done to me: for then I was ready to gasp for\nbreath, and my heart quite failed me. Then how dreadful are the words,\nthat he will decide my fate in three weeks! Gracious Heaven, said I,\nstrike me dead, before that time, with a thunderbolt, or provide some\nway for my escaping these threatened mischiefs! God forgive me, if I\nsinned!\n\nAt last, I took up the letter directed for Mrs. Jewkes, but designed\nfor me; and I find that little better than the other. These are the hard\nterms it contains:\n\n\n'Well have you done, perverse, forward, artful, yet foolish Pamela,\nto convince me, before it was too late, how ill I had done to place my\naffections on so unworthy an object: I had vowed honour and love to your\nunworthiness, believing you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted\ninnocence; and that no perfidious designs lurked in so fair a bosom. But\nnow I have found you out, you specious hypocrite! and I see, that though\nyou could not repose the least confidence in one you had known for\nyears, and who, under my good mother's misplaced favour for you, had\ngrown up in a manner with you; when my passion, in spite of my pride,\nand the difference of our condition, made me stoop to a meanness that\nnow I despise myself for; yet you could enter into an intrigue with a\nman you never knew till within these few days past, and resolve to run\naway with a stranger, whom your fair face, and insinuating arts, had\nbewitched to break through all the ties of honour and gratitude to me,\neven at a time when the happiness of his future life depended upon my\nfavour.\n\n'Henceforth, for Pamela's sake, whenever I see a lovely face, will\nI mistrust a deceitful heart; and whenever I hear of the greatest\npretences to innocence, will I suspect some deep-laid mischief. You were\ndetermined to place no confidence in me, though I have solemnly, over\nand over, engaged my honour to you. What, though I had alarmed your\nfears in sending you one way, when you hoped to go another; yet, had\nI not, to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you, (although\nwith great reluctance, such then was my love for you,) engaged not\nto come near you without your own consent? Was not this a voluntary\ndemonstration of the generosity of my intention to you? Yet how have\nyou requited me? The very first fellow that your charming face, and\ninsinuating address, could influence, you have practised upon, corrupted\ntoo, I may say, (and even ruined, as the ungrateful wretch shall find,)\nand thrown your forward self upon him. As, therefore, you would place no\nconfidence in me, my honour owes you nothing; and, in a little time, you\nshall find how much you have erred, in treating, as you have done, a man\nwho was once\n\n                                     'Your affectionate and kind friend.'\n\n'Mrs. Jewkes has directions concerning you: and if your lot is now\nharder than you might wish, you will bear it the easier, because your\nown rash folly has brought it upon you.'\n\n\nAlas! for me, what a fate is mine, to be thus thought artful, and\nforward, and ungrateful; when all I intended was to preserve my\ninnocence; and when all the poor little shifts, which his superior\nwicked wit and cunning have rendered ineffectual, were forced upon me in\nmy own necessary defence!\n\nWhen Mrs. Jewkes came up to me again, she found me bathed in tears. She\nseemed, as I thought, to be moved to some compassion; and finding myself\nnow entirely in her power, and that it is not for me to provoke her,\nI said, It is now, I see, in vain for me to contend against my evil\ndestiny, and the superior arts of my barbarous master. I will resign\nmyself to the Divine will, and prepare to expect the worst. But you see\nhow this poor Mr. Williams is drawn in and undone: I am sorry I am made\nthe cause of his ruin. Poor, poor man!--to be thus involved, and for my\nsake too!--But if you'll believe me, said I, I gave no encouragement\nto what he proposed, as to marriage; nor would he have proposed it, I\nbelieve, but as the only honourable way he thought was left to save me:\nAnd his principal motive to it at all, was virtue and compassion to\none in distress. What other view could he have? You know I am poor and\nfriendless. All I beg of you is, to let the poor gentleman have notice\nof my master's resentment; and let him fly the country, and not be\nthrown into gaol. This will answer my master's end as well; for it will\nas effectually hinder him from assisting me, as if he was in a prison.\n\nAsk me, said she, to do any thing that is in my power, consistent with\nmy duty and trust, and I will do it: for I am sorry for you both. But,\nto be sure, I shall keep no correspondence with him, nor let you. I\noffered to talk of a duty superior to that she mentioned, which would\noblige her to help distressed innocence, and not permit her to go the\nlengths enjoined by lawless tyranny; but she plainly bid me be silent on\nthat head: for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her\ntrust:--All I have to advise you, said she, is to be easy; lay aside\nall your contrivances and arts to get away, and make me your friend,\nby giving me no reason to suspect you; for I glory in my fidelity to my\nmaster: And you have both practised some strange sly arts, to make such\na progress as he has owned there was between you, so seldom as I thought\nyou saw one another; and I must be more circumspect than I have been.\n\nThis doubled my concern; for I now apprehended I should be much closer\nwatched than before.\n\nWell, said I, since I have, by this strange accident, discovered my hard\ndestiny; let me read over again that fearful letter of yours, that I\nmay get it by heart, and with it feed my distress, and make calamity\nfamiliar to me. Then, said she, let me read yours again. I gave her\nmine, and she lent me hers: and so I took a copy of it, with her leave;\nbecause, as I said I would, by it, prepare myself for the worst. And\nwhen I had done, I pinned it on the head of the couch: This, said I, is\nthe use I shall make of this wretched copy of your letter; and here you\nshall always find it wet with my tears.\n\nShe said she would go down to order supper; and insisted upon my company\nto it. I would have excused myself; but she began to put on a commanding\nair, that I durst not oppose. And when I went down, she took me by the\nhand, and presented me to the most hideous monster I ever saw in my\nlife. Here, Monsieur Colbrand, said she, here is your pretty ward and\nmine; let us try to make her time with us easy. He bowed, and put on his\nforeign grimaces, and seemed to bless himself; and, in broken English,\ntold me, I was happy in de affections of de finest gentleman in de\nvarld!--I was quite frightened, and ready to drop down; and I will\ndescribe him to you, my dear father and mother, if now you will ever see\nthis: and you shall judge if I had not reason, especially not knowing he\nwas to be there, and being apprised, as I was, of his hated employment,\nto watch me closer.\n\nHe is a giant of a man for stature; taller by a good deal than Harry\nMowlidge, in your neighbourhood, and large boned, and scraggy; and has\na hand!--I never saw such an one in my life. He has great staring eyes,\nlike the bull's that frightened me so; vast jaw-bones sticking out:\neyebrows hanging over his eyes; two great scars upon his forehead, and\none on his left cheek; and two large whiskers, and a monstrous wide\nmouth; blubber lips; long yellow teeth, and a hideous grin. He wears\nhis own frightful long hair, tied up in a great black bag; a black crape\nneckcloth about a long ugly neck: and his throat sticking out like a\nwen. As to the rest, he was dressed well enough, and had a sword on,\nwith a nasty red knot to it; leather garters, buckled below his knees;\nand a foot--near as long as my arm, I verily think.\n\nHe said, he fright de lady; and offered to withdraw; but she bid him\nnot; and I told Mrs. Jewkes, That as she knew I had been crying, she\nshould not have called me to the gentleman without letting me know he\nwas there. I soon went up to my closet; for my heart ached all the time\nI was at table, not being able to look upon him without horror; and this\nbrute of a woman, though she saw my distress, before this addition to\nit, no doubt did it on purpose to strike more terror into me. And indeed\nit had its effect: for when I went to bed, I could think of nothing but\nhis hideous person, and my master's more hideous actions: and thought\nthem too well paired; and when I dropt asleep, I dreamed they were both\ncoming to my bedside, with the worst designs; and I jumped out of my bed\nin my sleep, and frightened Mrs. Jewkes; till, waking with the terror, I\ntold her my dream; and the wicked creature only laughed, and said, All I\nfeared was but a dream, as well as that; and when it was over, and I was\nwell awake, I should laugh at it as such!\n\n\nAnd now I am come to the close of Wednesday, the 27th day of my\ndistress.\n\nPoor Mr. Williams is actually arrested, and carried away to Stamford.\nSo there is an end of all my hopes from him, poor gentleman! His\nover-security and openness have ruined us both! I was but too well\nconvinced, that we ought not to have lost a moment's time; but he\nwas half angry, and thought me too impatient; and then his fatal\nconfessions, and the detestable artifice of my master!--But one might\nwell think, that he who had so cunningly, and so wickedly, contrived\nall his stratagems hitherto, that it was impossible to avoid them, would\nstick at nothing to complete them. I fear I shall soon find it so!\n\nBut one stratagem I have just invented, though a very discouraging one\nto think of; because I have neither friends nor money, nor know one step\nof the way, if I was out of the house. But let bulls, and bears, and\nlions, and tigers, and, what is worse, false, treacherous, deceitful\nmen, stand in my way, I cannot be in more danger than I am; and I depend\nnothing upon his three weeks: for how do I know, now he is in such a\npassion, and has already begun his vengeance on poor Mr. Williams, that\nhe will not change his mind, and come down to Lincolnshire before he\ngoes to London?\n\nMy stratagem is this: I will endeavour to get Mrs. Jewkes to go to bed\nwithout me, as she often does, while I sit locked up in my closet: and\nas she sleeps very sound in her first sleep, of which she never fails to\ngive notice by snoring, if I can but then get out between the two bars\nof the window, (for you know I am very slender, and I find I can get\nmy head through,) then I can drop upon the leads underneath, which\nare little more than my height, and which leads are over a little\nsummer-parlour, that juts out towards the garden; and as I am light, I\ncan easily drop from them; for they are not high from the ground: then I\nshall be in the garden; and then, as I have the key of the back-door,\nI will get out. But I have another piece of cunning still: Good Heaven,\nsucceed to me my dangerous, but innocent devices!--I have read of a\ngreat captain, who, being in danger, leaped overboard into the sea,\nand his enemies, as he swam, shooting at him with bows and arrows, he\nunloosed his upper garment, and took another course, while they stuck\nthat full of their darts and arrows; and so he escaped, and lived\nto triumph over them all. So what will I do, but strip off my upper\npetticoat, and throw it into the pond, with my neckhandkerchief! For to\nbe sure, when they miss me, they will go to the pond first, thinking I\nhave drowned myself: and so, when they see some of my clothes floating\nthere, they will be all employed in dragging the pond, which is a very\nlarge one; and as I shall not, perhaps, be missed till the morning, this\nwill give me opportunity to get a great way off; and I am sure I will\nrun for it when I am out. And so I trust, that Providence will direct my\nsteps to some good place of safety, and make some worthy body my friend;\nfor sure, if I suffer ever so, I cannot be in more danger, nor in worse\nhands, than where I am; and with such avowed bad designs.\n\nO my dear parents! don't be frightened when you come to read this!--But\nall will be over before you can see it; and so God direct me for the\nbest! My writings, for fear I should not escape, I will bury in the\ngarden; for, to be sure, I shall be searched and used dreadfully if I\ncan't get off. And so I will close here, for the present, to prepare for\nmy plot. Prosper thou, O gracious Protector of oppressed innocence! this\nlast effort of thy poor handmaid! that I may escape the crafty devices\nand snares that have begun to entangle my virtue; and from which, but\nby this one trial, I see no way of escaping. And oh! whatever becomes of\nme, bless my dear parents, and protect poor Mr. Williams from ruin! for\nhe was happy before he knew me.\n\n\nJust now, just now! I heard Mrs. Jewkes, who is in her cups, own to the\nhorrid Colbrand, that the robbing of poor Mr. Williams was a contrivance\nof hers, and executed by the groom and a helper, in order to seize my\nletters upon him, which they missed. They are now both laughing at the\ndismal story, which they little think I overheard--O how my heart\naches! for what are not such wretches capable of! Can you blame me for\nendeavouring, through any danger, to get out of such clutches?\n\n\nPast eleven o'clock.\n\nMrs. Jewkes is come up, and gone to bed; and bids me not stay long in my\ncloset, but come to bed. O for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute! I\nnever saw her so tipsy, and that gives me hopes. I have tried again, and\nfind I can get my head through the iron bars. I am now all prepared,\nas soon as I hear her fast; and now I'll seal up these, and my other\npapers, my last work: and to thy providence, O my gracious God! commit\nthe rest.--Once more, God bless you both! and send us a happy meeting;\nif not here, in his heavenly kingdom. Amen.\n\n\nThursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st days\nof my distress.\n\nAnd distress indeed! For here I am still; and every thing has been worse\nand worse! Oh! the poor unhappy Pamela!--Without any hope left, and\nruined in all my contrivances. But, oh! my dear parents, rejoice with\nme, even in this low plunge of my distress; for your poor Pamela has\nescaped from an enemy worse than any she ever met with; an enemy she\nnever thought of before, and was hardly able to stand against: I mean,\nthe weakness and presumption, both in one, of her own mind; which\nhad well nigh, had not the divine grace interposed, sunk her into the\nlowest, last abyss of misery and perdition!\n\nI will proceed, as I have opportunity, with my sad relation: for my\npen and ink (in my now doubly-secured closet) are all I have to employ\nmyself with: and indeed I have been so weak, that, till yesterday\nevening, I have not been able to hold a pen.\n\nI took with me but one shift, besides what I had on, and two\nhandkerchiefs, and two caps, which my pocket held, (for it was not for\nme to encumber myself,) and all my stock of money, which was but five\nor six shillings, to set out for I knew not where; and got out of the\nwindow, not without some difficulty, sticking a little at my shoulders\nand hips; but I was resolved to get out, if possible. And it was farther\nfrom the leads than I thought, and I was afraid I had sprained my ancle;\nand when I had dropt from the leads to the ground, it was still farther\noff; but I did pretty well there, at least. I got no hurt to hinder me\nfrom pursuing my intentions. So being now on the ground, I hid my papers\nunder a rose-bush, and covered them with mould, and there they still\nlie, as I hope. Then I hied away to the pond: The clock struck twelve,\njust as I got out; and it was a dark misty night, and very cold; but I\nfelt it not then.\n\nWhen I came to the pond-side, I flung in my upper-coat, as I had\ndesigned, and my neckhandkerchief, and a round-eared cap, with a knot;\nand then with great speed ran to the door, and took the key out of my\npocket, my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom, as if it\nwould have forced its way through it: and beat it well might! for I\nthen, too late, found, that I was most miserably disappointed; for the\nwicked woman had taken off that lock, and put another on; so that my\nkey would not open it. I tried, and tried, and feeling about, I found\na padlock besides, on another part of the door. O then how my heart\nsunk!--I dropt down with grief and confusion, unable to stir or support\nmyself, for a while. But my fears awakening my resolution, and knowing\nthat my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger I could\nthen encounter, I clambered up upon the ledges of the door, and upon the\nlock, which was a great wooden one; and reached the top of the door with\nmy hands; then, little thinking I could climb so well, I made shift to\nlay hold on the top of the wall with my hands; but, alas for me! nothing\nbut ill luck!--no escape for poor Pamela! The wall being old, the bricks\nI held by gave way, just as I was taking a spring to get up; and down\ncame I, and received such a blow upon my head, with one of the bricks,\nthat it quite stunned me; and I broke my shins and my ancle besides, and\nbeat off the heel of one of my shoes.\n\nIn this dreadful way, flat upon the ground, lay poor I, for I believe\nfive or six minutes; and then trying to get up, I sunk down again two or\nthree times; and my left hip and shoulder were very stiff, and full of\npain, with bruises; and, besides, my head bled, and ached grievously\nwith the blow I had with the brick. Yet these hurts I valued not; but\ncrept a good way upon my feet and hands, in search of a ladder, I just\nrecollected to have seen against the wall two days before, on which the\ngardener was nailing a nectarine branch that was loosened from the\nwall: but no ladder could I find, and the wall was very high. What now,\nthought I, must become of the miserable Pamela!--Then I began to wish\nmyself most heartily again in my closet, and to repent of my attempt,\nwhich I now censured as rash, because it did not succeed.\n\nGod forgive me! but a sad thought came just then into my head!--I\ntremble to think of it! Indeed my apprehensions of the usage I should\nmeet with, had like to have made me miserable for ever! O my dear, dear\nparents, forgive your poor child; but being then quite desperate, I\ncrept along, till I could raise myself on my staggering feet; and away\nlimped I!--What to do, but to throw myself into the pond, and so put a\nperiod to all my griefs in this world!--But, O! to find them infinitely\naggravated (had I not, by the divine grace, been withheld) in a\nmiserable eternity! As I have escaped this temptation, (blessed be God\nfor it!) I will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion, that\nthe divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance, that I am yet on\nthis side the dreadful gulf, from which there could have been no return.\n\nIt was well for me, as I have since thought, that I was so maimed, as\nmade me the longer before I got to the water; for this gave me time to\nconsider, and abated the impetuousness of my passions, which possibly\nmight otherwise have hurried me, in my first transport of grief, (on my\nseeing no way to escape, and the hard usage I had reason to expect from\nmy dreadful keepers,) to throw myself in. But my weakness of body\nmade me move so slowly, that it gave time, as I said, for a little\nreflection, a ray of grace, to dart in upon my benighted mind; and so,\nwhen I came to the pond-side, I sat myself down on the sloping bank, and\nbegan to ponder my wretched condition; and thus I reasoned with myself.\n\nPause here a little, Pamela, on what thou art about, before thou takest\nthe dreadful leap; and consider whether there be no way yet left, no\nhope, if not to escape from this wicked house, yet from the mischiefs\nthreatened thee in it.\n\nI then considered; and, after I had cast about in my mind every thing\nthat could make me hope, and saw no probability; a wicked woman, devoid\nof all compassion! a horrid helper, just arrived, in this dreadful\nColbrand! an angry and resenting master, who now hated me, and\nthreatened the most afflicting evils! and that I should, in all\nprobability, be deprived even of the opportunity, I now had before\nme, to free myself from all their persecutions!--What hast thou to do,\ndistressed creature, said I to myself, but throw thyself upon a merciful\nGod, (who knows how innocently I suffer,) to avoid the merciless\nwickedness of those who are determined on my ruin?\n\nAnd then, thought I, (and oh! that thought was surely of the devil's\ninstigation; for it was very soothing, and powerful with me,) these\nwicked wretches, who now have no remorse, no pity on me, will then be\nmoved to lament their misdoings; and when they see the dead corpse of\nthe unhappy Pamela dragged out to these dewy banks, and lying breathless\nat their feet, they will find that remorse to soften their obdurate\nheart, which, now, has no place there!--And my master, my angry master,\nwill then forget his resentments, and say, O, this is the unhappy\nPamela! that I have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed! Now do\nI see she preferred her honesty to her life, will he say, and is no\nhypocrite, nor deceiver; but really was the innocent creature she\npretended to be! Then, thought I, will he, perhaps, shed a few tears\nover the poor corpse of his persecuted servant; and though he may give\nout, it was love and disappointment; and that, perhaps, (in order to\nhide his own guilt,) for the unfortunate Mr. Williams, yet will he be\ninwardly grieved, and order me a decent funeral, and save me, or rather\nthis part of me, from the dreadful stake, and the highway interment;\nand the young men and maidens all around my dear father's will pity poor\nPamela! But, O! I hope I shall not be the subject of their ballads and\nelegies; but that my memory, for the sake of my dear father and mother,\nmay quickly slide into oblivion.\n\nI was once rising, so indulgent was I to this sad way of thinking, to\nthrow myself in: But, again, my bruises made me slow; and I thought,\nWhat art thou about to do, wretched Pamela? How knowest thou, though the\nprospect be all dark to thy short-sighted eye, what God may do for thee,\neven when all human means fail? God Almighty would not lay me under\nthese sore afflictions, if he had not given me strength to grapple with\nthem, if I will exert it as I ought: And who knows, but that the very\npresence I so much dread of my angry and designing master, (for he has\nhad me in his power before, and yet I have escaped;) may be better for\nme, than these persecuting emissaries of his, who, for his money, are\ntrue to their wicked trust, and are hardened by that, and a long habit\nof wickedness, against compunction of heart? God can touch his heart in\nan instant; and if this should not be done, I can then but put an end to\nmy life by some other means, if I am so resolved.\n\nBut how do I know, thought I, that even these bruises and maims that I\nhave gotten, while I pursued only the laudable escape I had meditated,\nmay not kindly have furnished me with the opportunity I am now tempted\nwith to precipitate myself, and of surrendering up my life, spotless and\nunguilty, to that merciful Being who gave it!\n\nThen, thought I, who gave thee, presumptuous as thou art, a power over\nthy life? Who authorised thee to put an end to it, when the weakness\nof thy mind suggests not to thee a way to preserve it with honour? How\nknowest thou what purposes God may have to serve, by the trials with\nwhich thou art now exercised? Art thou to put a bound to the divine\nwill, and to say, Thus much will I bear, and no more? And wilt thou dare\nto say, That if the trial be augmented and continued, thou wilt sooner\ndie than bear it?\n\nThis act of despondency, thought I, is a sin, that, if I pursue it,\nadmits of no repentance, and can therefore hope no forgiveness.--And\nwilt thou, to shorten thy transitory griefs, heavy as they are, and weak\nas thou fanciest thyself, plunge both body and soul into everlasting\nmisery! Hitherto, Pamela, thought I, thou art the innocent, the\nsuffering Pamela; and wilt thou, to avoid thy sufferings, be the guilty\naggressor? And, because wicked men persecute thee, wilt thou fly in the\nface of the Almighty, and distrust his grace and goodness, who can still\nturn all these sufferings to benefits? And how do I know, but that God,\nwho sees all the lurking vileness of my heart, may have permitted these\nsufferings on that very score, and to make me rely solely on his grace\nand assistance, who, perhaps, have too much prided myself in a vain\ndependence on my own foolish contrivances?\n\nThen, again, thought I, wilt thou suffer in one moment all the good\nlessons of thy poor honest parents, and the benefit of their example,\n(who have persisted in doing their duty with resignation to the divine\nwill, amidst the extreme degrees of disappointment, poverty, and\ndistress, and the persecutions of an ungrateful world, and merciless\ncreditors,) to be thrown away upon thee: and bring down, as in all\nprobability this thy rashness will, their grey hairs with sorrow to\nthe grave, when they shall understand, that their beloved daughter,\nslighting the tenders of divine grace, despairing of the mercies of a\nprotecting God, has blemished, in this last act, a whole life, which\nthey had hitherto approved and delighted in?\n\nWhat then, presumptuous Pamela, dost thou here? thought I: Quit with\nspeed these perilous banks, and fly from these curling waters, that\nseem, in their meaning murmurs, this still night, to reproach thy\nrashness! Tempt not God's goodness on the mossy banks, that have been\nwitnesses of thy guilty purpose: and while thou hast power left thee,\navoid the tempting evil, lest thy grand enemy, now repulsed by divine\ngrace, and due reflection, return to the assault with a force that thy\nweakness may not be able to resist! and let one rash moment destroy all\nthe convictions, which now have awed thy rebellious mind into duty and\nresignation to the divine will!\n\nAnd so saying, I arose; but was so stiff with my hurts, so cold with the\nmoist dew of the night, and the wet grass on which I had sat, as also\nwith the damps arising from so large a piece of water, that with great\npain I got from this pond, which now I think of with terror; and bending\nmy limping steps towards the house, took refuge in the corner of an\nouthouse, where wood and coals are laid up for family use, till I\nshould be found by my cruel keepers, and consigned to a more wretched\nconfinement, and worse usage than I had hitherto experienced; and there\nbehind a pile of firewood I crept, and lay down, as you may imagine,\nwith a mind just broken, and a heart sensible to nothing but the\nextremest woe and dejection.\n\nThis, my dear father and mother, is the issue of your poor Pamela's\nfruitless enterprise; and who knows, if I had got out at the back-door,\nwhether I had been at all in a better case, moneyless, friendless, as I\nam, and in a strange place!--But blame not your poor daughter too much:\nNay, if ever you see this miserable scribble, all bathed and blotted\nwith my tears, let your pity get the better of your reprehension! But\nI know it will--And I must leave off for the present.--For, oh!\nmy strength and my will are at this time very far unequal to one\nanother.--But yet I will add, that though I should have praised God\nfor my deliverance, had I been freed from my wicked keepers, and my\ndesigning master; yet I have more abundant reason to praise him, that I\nhave been delivered from a worse enemy,--myself!\n\n\nI will conclude my sad relation.\n\n\nIt seems Mrs. Jewkes awaked not till day-break; and not finding me in\nbed, she called me; and, no answer being returned, she relates, that she\ngot out of bed, and ran to my closet; and, missing me, searched under\nthe bed, and in another closet, finding the chamber-door as she had left\nit, quite fast, and the key, as usual, about her wrist. For if I could\nhave got out of the chamber-door, there were two or three passages,\nand doors to them all, double-locked and barred, to go through into\nthe great garden; so that, to escape, there was no way, but out of the\nwindow; and of that window, because of the summer-parlour under it: for\nthe other windows are a great way from the ground.\n\nShe says she was excessively frightened; and instantly raised the Swiss,\nand the two maids, who lay not far off; and finding every door fast, she\nsaid, I must be carried away, as St. Peter was out of prison, by some\nangel. It is a wonder she had not a worse thought!\n\nShe says, she wept, and wrung her hands, and took on sadly, running\nabout like a mad woman, little thinking I could have got out of the\ncloset window, between the iron bars; and, indeed, I don't know whether\nI could do so again. But at last finding that casement open, they\nconcluded it must be so; and ran out into the garden, and found my\nfootsteps in the mould of the bed which I dropt down upon from the\nleads: And so speeded away all of them; that is to say, Mrs. Jewkes,\nColbrand, and Nan, towards the back-door, to see if that was fast; while\nthe cook was sent to the out-offices to raise the men, and make them get\nhorses ready, to take each a several way to pursue me.\n\nBut, it seems, finding that door double-locked and padlocked, and the\nheel of my shoe, and the broken bricks, they verily concluded I was got\naway by some means over the wall; and then, they say, Mrs. Jewkes\nseemed like a distracted woman: Till, at last, Nan had the thought to go\ntowards the pond: and there seeing my coat, and cap, and handkerchief,\nin the water, cast almost to the banks by the agitation of the waves,\nshe thought it was me; and, screaming out, ran to Mrs. Jewkes, and said,\nO, madam, madam! here's a piteous thing!--Mrs. Pamela lies drowned in\nthe pond. Thither they all ran; and finding my clothes, doubted not\nI was at the bottom; and they all, Swiss among the rest, beat their\nbreasts, and made most dismal lamentations; and Mrs. Jewkes sent Nan to\nthe men, to bid them get the drag-net ready, and leave the horses, and\ncome to try to find the poor innocent! as she, it seems, then called\nme, beating her breast, and lamenting my hard hap; but most what would\nbecome of them, and what account they should give to my master.\n\nWhile every one was thus differently employed, some weeping and wailing,\nsome running here and there, Nan came into the wood-house; and there\nlay poor I; so weak, so low, and dejected, and withal so stiff with my\nbruises, that I could not stir, nor help myself to get upon my feet.\nAnd I said, with a low voice, (for I could hardly speak,) Mrs. Ann! Mrs.\nAnn!--The creature was sadly frightened, but was taking up a billet to\nknock me on the head, believing I was some thief, as she said; but\nI cried out, O Mrs. Ann, Mrs. Ann, help me, for pity's sake, to\nMrs. Jewkes! for I cannot get up!--Bless me, said she, what! you,\nmadam!--Why, our hearts are almost broken, and we were going to drag the\npond for you, believing you had drowned yourself. Now, said she, you'll\nmake us all alive again!\n\nAnd, without helping me, she ran away to the pond, and brought all the\ncrew to the wood-house.--The wicked woman, as she entered, said, Where\nis she?--Plague of her spells, and her witchcrafts! She shall dearly\nrepent of this trick, if my name be Jewkes; and, coming to me, took hold\nof my arm so roughly, and gave me such a pull, as made me squeal out,\n(my shoulder being bruised on that side,) and drew me on my face. O\ncruel creature! said I, if you knew what I have suffered, it would move\nyou to pity me!\n\nEven Colbrand seemed to be concerned, and said, Fie, madam, fie! you\nsee she is almost dead! You must not be so rough with her. The coachman\nRobin seemed to be sorry for me too, and said, with sobs, What a\nscene is here! Don't you see she is all bloody in her head, and cannot\nstir?--Curse of her contrivance! said the horrid creature; she\nhas frightened me out of my wits, I'm sure. How the d---l came you\nhere?--Oh! said I, ask me now no questions, but let the maids carry\nme up to my prison; and there let me die decently, and in peace! For,\nindeed, I thought I could not live two hours.\n\nThe still more inhuman tigress said, I suppose you want Mr. Williams to\npray by you, don't you? Well, I'll send for my master this minute: let\nhim come and watch you himself, for me; for there's no such thing as\nholding you, I'm sure.\n\nSo the maids took me up between them, and carried me to my chamber; and\nwhen the wretch saw how bad I was, she began a little to relent--while\nevery one wondered (at which I had neither strength nor inclination to\ntell them) how all this came to pass, which they imputed to sorcery and\nwitchcraft.\n\nI was so weak, when I had got up stairs, that I fainted away, with\ndejection, pain, and fatigue; and they undressed me, and got me to bed;\nand Mrs. Jewkes ordered Nan to bathe my shoulder, and arm, and ancle,\nwith some old rum warmed; and they cut the hair a little from the back\npart of my head, and washed that; for it was clotted with blood, from\na pretty long, but not a deep gash; and put a family plaister upon it;\nfor, if this woman has any good quality, it is, it seems, in a readiness\nand skill to manage in cases, where sudden misfortunes happen in a\nfamily.\n\nAfter this, I fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep, and lay\ntill twelve o'clock, tolerably easy, considering I was very feverish,\nand aguishly inclined; and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo\nmore trials, which I had hoped would have been happily ended: but\nProvidence did not see fit.\n\nShe would make me rise about twelve: but I was so weak, I could only sit\nup till the bed was made, and went into it again; and was, as they said,\ndelirious some part of the afternoon. But having a tolerable night on\nThursday, I was a good deal better on Friday, and on Saturday got up,\nand ate a little spoon-meat, and my feverishness seemed to be gone; and\nI was so mended by evening, that I begged her indulgence in my closet,\nto be left to myself; which she consented to, it being double-barred the\nday before, and I assuring her, that all my contrivances, as she called\nthem, were at an end. But first she made me tell the whole story of my\nenterprise; which I did very faithfully, knowing now that nothing could\nstand me in any stead, or contribute to my safety and escape: And she\nseemed full of wonder at my resolution; but told me frankly, that I\nshould have found it a hard matter to get quite off; for that she was\nprovided with a warrant from my master (who is a justice of peace in\nthis county as well as in the other) to get me apprehended, if I had got\naway, on suspicion of wronging him, let me have been where I would.\n\nO how deep-laid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted\nhead!--Surely, surely, I cannot be worthy of all this contrivance! This\ntoo well shews me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the\nother house, that my master swore he would have me! O preserve me,\nHeaven! from being his, in his own wicked sense of the adjuration!\n\nI must add, that now the woman sees me pick up so fast, she uses me\nworse, and has abridged me of paper, all but one sheet, which I am to\nshew her, written or unwritten, on demand: and has reduced me to one\npen: yet my hidden stores stand me in stead. But she is more and more\nsnappish and cross; and tauntingly calls me Mrs. Williams, and any thing\nshe thinks will vex me.\n\n\nSunday afternoon.\n\nMrs. Jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing, for three or four\nhours, this afternoon; and I am a good deal better and should be much\nmore so, if I knew for what I am reserved. But health is a blessing\nhardly to be coveted in my circumstances, since that but exposes me\nto the calamity I am in continual apprehensions of; whereas a weak and\nsickly state might possibly move compassion for me. O how I dread the\ncoming of this angry and incensed master; though I am sure I have done\nhim no harm!\n\nJust now we heard, that he had like to have been drowned in crossing the\nstream, a few days ago, in pursuing his game. What is the matter, that\nwith all his ill usage of me, I cannot hate him? To be sure, I am not\nlike other people! He has certainly done enough to make me hate him; but\nyet, when I heard his danger, which was very great, I could not in my\nheart forbear rejoicing for his safety; though his death would have\nended my afflictions. Ungenerous master! if you knew this, you surely\nwould not be so much my persecutor! But, for my late good lady's sake,\nI must wish him well; and O what an angel would he be in my eyes yet, if\nhe would cease his attempts, and reform!\n\nWell, I hear by Mrs. Jewkes, that John Arnold is turned away, being\ndetected in writing to Mr. Williams; and that Mr. Longman, and Mr.\nJonathan the butler, have incurred his displeasure, for offering to\nspeak in my behalf. Mrs. Jervis too is in danger; for all these three,\nprobably, went together to beg in my favour; for now it is known where I\nam.\n\nMrs. Jewkes has, with the news about my master, received a letter:\nbut she says the contents are too bad for me to know. They must be bad\nindeed, if they be worse than what I have already known.\n\nJust now the horrid creature tells me, as a secret, that she has reason\nto think he has found out a way to satisfy my scruples: It is, by\nmarrying me to this dreadful Colbrand, and buying me of him on the\nwedding day, for a sum of money!--Was ever the like heard?--She says\nit will be my duty to obey my husband; and that Mr. Williams will be\nforced, as a punishment, to marry us; and that, when my master has paid\nfor me, and I am surrendered up, the Swiss is to go home again, with the\nmoney, to his former wife and children; for, she says, it is the custom\nof those people to have a wife in every nation.\n\nBut this, to be sure, is horrid romancing! Yet, abominable as it is,\nit may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatching!--With\nwhat strange perplexities is my poor mind agitated! Perchance, some\nsham-marriage may be designed, on purpose to ruin me; But can a husband\nsell his wife against her own consent?--And will such a bargain stand\ngood in law?\n\n\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the 32d, 33d, and 34th days of my\nimprisonment.\n\nNothing offers these days but squabblings between Mrs. Jewkes and me.\nShe grows worse and worse to me. I vexed her yesterday, because\nshe talked nastily; and told her she talked more like a vile London\nprostitute, than a gentleman's housekeeper; and she thinks she cannot\nuse me bad enough for it. Bless me! she curses and storms at me like a\ntrooper, and can hardly keep her hands off me. You may believe she\nmust talk sadly, to make me say such harsh words: indeed it cannot be\nrepeated; as she is a disgrace to her sex. And then she ridicules me,\nand laughs at my notions of honesty; and tells me, impudent creature\nas she is! what a fine bed-fellow I shall make for my master (and\nsuch-like), with such whimsical notions about me!--Do you think this\nis to be borne? And yet she talks worse than this, if possible! quite\nfilthily! O what vile hands am I put into!\n\n\nThursday.\n\nI have now all the reason that can be, to apprehend my master will be\nhere soon; for the servants are busy in setting the house to rights; and\na stable and coach-house are cleaning out, that have not been used some\ntime. I asked Mrs. Jewkes; but she tells me nothing, nor will hardly\nanswer me when I ask her a question. Sometimes I think she puts on these\nstrange wicked airs to me, purposely to make me wish for, what I dread\nmost of all things, my master's coming down. He talk of love!--If he had\nany the least notion of regard for me, to be sure he would not give\nthis naughty body such power over me:--And if he does come, where is\nhis promise of not seeing me without I consent to it? But, it seems, his\nhonour owes me nothing! So he tells me in his letter. And why? Because\nI am willing to keep mine. But, indeed, he says, he hates me perfectly:\nBut it is plain he does, or I should not be left to the mercy of this\nwoman: and, what is worse, to my woful apprehensions.\n\n\nFriday, the 36th day of my imprisonment.\n\nI took the liberty yesterday afternoon, finding the gates open, to walk\nout before the house; and, ere I was aware, had got to the bottom of the\nlong row of elms; and there I sat myself down upon the steps of a sort\nof broad stile, which leads into the road, and goes towards the town.\nAnd as I sat musing upon what always busies my mind, I saw a whole\nbody of folks running towards me from the house, men and women, as in a\nfright. At first I wondered what was the matter, till they came nearer;\nand I found they were all alarmed, thinking I had attempted to get off.\nThere was first the horrible Colbrand, running with his long legs, well\nnigh two yards at a stride; then there was one of the grooms, poor\nMr. Williams's robber; then I spied Nan, half out of breath, and the\ncook-maid after her! and lastly, came waddling, as fast as she could,\nMrs. Jewkes, exclaiming most bitterly, as I found, against me. Colbrand\nsaid, O how have you frighted us all!--And went behind me, lest I should\nrun away, as I suppose.\n\nI sat still, to let them see I had no view to get away; for, besides\nthe improbability of succeeding, my last sad attempt has cured me of\nenterprising again. And when Mrs. Jewkes came within hearing, I found\nher terribly incensed, and raving about my contrivances. Why, said I,\nshould you be so concerned? Here I have sat a few minutes, and had not\nthe least thought of getting away, or going farther; but to return as\nsoon as it was duskish. She would not believe me; and the barbarous\ncreature struck at me with her horrid fist, and, I believe, would have\nfelled me, had not Colbrand interposed, and said, He saw me sitting\nstill, looking about me, and not seeming to have the least inclination\nto stir. But this would not serve: She ordered the two maids to take\nme each by an arm, and lead me back into the house, and up stairs; and\nthere have I been locked up ever since, without shoes. In vain have I\npleaded, that I had no design, as indeed I had not the least; and last\nnight I was forced to be between her and Nan; and I find she is resolved\nto make a handle of this against me, and in her own behalf.--Indeed,\nwhat with her usage, and my own apprehensions of still worse, I am quite\nweary of my life.\n\nJust now she has been with me, and given me my shoes, and has laid her\nimperious commands upon me, to dress myself in a suit of clothes out\nof the portmanteau, which I have not seen lately, against three or four\no'clock; for she says, she is to have a visit from Lady Darnford's two\ndaughters, who come purposely to see me; and so she gave me the key of\nthe portmanteau. But I will not obey her; and I told her, I would not\nbe made a show of, nor see the ladies. She left me, saying, it would be\nworse for me, if I did not. But how can that be?\n\n\nFive o'clock is come,\n\nAnd no young ladies!--So that I fancy--But hold! I hear their coach,\nI believe. I'll step to the window.--I won't go down to them, I am\nresolved--\n\nGood sirs! good sirs! What will become of me! Here is my master come\nin his fine chariot!--Indeed he is! What shall I do? Where shall I\nhide myself?--O! What shall I do? Pray for me! But oh! you'll not see\nthis!--Now, good God of heaven, preserve me; if it be thy blessed will!\n\n\nSeven o'clock.\n\nThough I dread to see him, yet do I wonder I have not. To be sure\nsomething is resolved against me, and he stays to hear all her stories.\nI can hardly write; yet, as I can do nothing else, I know not how\nto forbear!--Yet I cannot hold my pen--How crooked and trembling the\nlines!--I must leave off, till I can get quieter fingers!--Why should\nthe guiltless tremble so, when the guilty can possess their minds in\npeace?\n\n\nSaturday morning.\n\nNow let me give you an account of what passed last night: for I had no\npower to write, nor yet opportunity till now.\n\nThis vile woman held my master till half an hour after seven; and he\ncame hither about five in the afternoon. And then I heard his voice on\nthe stairs, as he was coming up to me. It was about his supper; for he\nsaid, I shall choose a boiled chicken with butter and parsley.--And up\nhe came!\n\nHe put on a stern and majestic air; and he can look very majestic when\nhe pleases. Well, perverse Pamela, ungrateful runaway, said he, for my\nfirst salutation!--You do well, don't you, to give me all this trouble\nand vexation! I could not speak; but throwing myself on the floor, hid\nmy face, and was ready to die with grief and apprehension.--He said,\nWell may you hide your face! well may you be ashamed to see me, vile\nforward one, as you are!--I sobbed and wept, but could not speak. And he\nlet me lie, and went to the door, and called Mrs. Jewkes.--There, said\nhe, take up that fallen angel!--Once I thought her as innocent as an\nangel of light but I have now no patience with her. The little hypocrite\nprostrates herself thus, in hopes to move my weakness in her favour, and\nthat I'll raise her from the floor myself. But I shall not touch her:\nNo, said he, cruel gentleman as he was! let such fellows as Williams\nbe taken in by her artful wiles! I know her now, and see she is for any\nfool's turn, that will be caught by her.\n\nI sighed, as if my heart would break!--And Mrs. Jewkes lifted me up upon\nmy knees; for I trembled so, I could not stand. Come, said she, Mrs.\nPamela, learn to know your best friend; confess your unworthy behaviour,\nand beg his honour's forgiveness of all your faults. I was ready to\nfaint: And he said, She is mistress of arts, I'll assure you; and will\nmimic a fit, ten to one, in a minute.\n\nI was struck to the heart at this; but could not speak presently; only\nlifted up my eyes to heaven!--And at last made shift to say--God forgive\nyou, sir!--He seemed in a great passion, and walked up and down the\nroom, casting sometimes an eye upon me, and seeming as if he would have\nspoken, but checked himself--And at last he said, When she has acted\nthis her first part over, perhaps I will see her again, and she shall\nsoon know what she has to trust to.\n\nAnd so he went out of the room: And I was quite sick at heart!--Surely,\nsaid I, I am the wickedest creature that ever breathed! Well, said the\nimpertinent, not so wicked as that neither; but I am glad you begin\nto see your faults. Nothing like being humble!--Come, I'll stand your\nfriend, and plead for you, if you'll promise to be more dutiful for\nthe future: Come, come, added the wretch, this may be all made up by\nto-morrow morning, if you are not a fool.--Begone, hideous woman! said\nI, and let not my affliction be added to by thy inexorable cruelty, and\nunwomanly wickedness.\n\nShe gave me a push, and went away in a violent passion: And it seems,\nshe made a story of this; and said, I had such a spirit, there was no\nbearing it.\n\nI laid me down on the floor, and had no power to stir, till the clock\nstruck nine: and then the wicked woman came up again. You must come down\nstairs, said she, to my master; that is, if you please, spirit!--Said\nI, I believe I cannot stand. Then, said she, I'll send Mons. Colbrand to\ncarry you down.\n\nI got up as well as I could, and trembled all the way down stairs:\nAnd she went before me into the parlour; and a new servant that he had\nwaiting on him, instead of John, withdrew as soon as I came in: And,\nby the way, he had a new coachman too, which looked as if Bedfordshire\nRobin was turned away.\n\nI thought, said he, when I came down, you should have sat at table\nwith me, when I had not company; but when I find you cannot forget your\noriginal, but must prefer my menials to me, I call you down to wait on\nme while I sup, that I may have some talk with you, and throw away as\nlittle time as possible upon you.\n\nSir, said I, you do me honour to wait upon you:--And I never shall, I\nhope, forget my original. But I was forced to stand behind his chair,\nthat I might hold by it. Fill me, said he, a glass of that Burgundy.\nI went to do it, but my hand shook so, that I could not hold the plate\nwith the glass in it, and spilt some of the wine. So Mrs. Jewkes poured\nit for me, and I carried it as well as I could; and made a low courtesy.\nHe took it, and said, Stand behind me, out of my sight!\n\nWhy, Mrs. Jewkes, said he, you tell me she remains very sullen still,\nand eats nothing. No, said she, not so much as will keep life and soul\ntogether.--And is always crying, you say, too? Yes, sir, answered she, I\nthink she is, for one thing or another. Ay, said he, your young wenches\nwill feed upon their tears; and their obstinacy will serve them for meat\nand drink. I think I never saw her look better though, in my life!--But,\nI suppose, she lives upon love. This sweet Mr. Williams, and her little\nvillanous plots together, have kept her alive and well, to be sure: For\nmischief, love, and contradiction, are the natural aliments of a woman.\n\nPoor I was forced to hear all this, and be silent; and indeed my heart\nwas too full to speak.\n\nAnd so you say, said he, that she had another project, but yesterday, to\nget away? She denies it herself, said she; but it had all the appearance\nof one. I'm sure she made me in a fearful pucker about it: And I am glad\nyour honour is come, with all my heart; and I hope, whatever be your\nhonour's intention concerning her, you will not be long about it; for\nyou'll find her as slippery as an eel, I'll assure you.\n\nSir, said I, and clasped his knees with my arms, not knowing what I did,\nand falling on my knees, Have mercy on me, and hear me, concerning that\nwicked woman's usage of me--\n\nHe cruelly interrupted me, and said, I am satisfied she has done her\nduty: it signifies nothing what you say against Mrs. Jewkes. That you\nare here, little hypocrite as you are, pleading your cause before me,\nis owing to her care of you; else you had been with the parson.--Wicked\ngirl! said he, to tempt a man to undo himself, as you have done him, at\na time I was on the point of making him happy for his life!\n\nI arose; but said with a deep sigh, I have done, sir!--I have done!--I\nhave a strange tribunal to plead before. The poor sheep in the fable had\nsuch an one; when it was tried before the vulture, on the accusation of\nthe wolf!\n\nSo, Mrs. Jewkes, said he, you are the wolf, I the vulture, and this the\npoor innocent lamb on her trial before us.--Oh! you don't know how well\nthis innocent is read in reflection. She has wit at will, when she has\na mind to display her own romantic innocence, at the price of other\npeople's characters.\n\nWell, said the aggravated creature, this is nothing to what she\nhas called me: I have been a Jezebel, a London prostitute, and what\nnot?--But I am contented with her ill names, now I see it is her\nfashion, and she can call your honour a vulture.\n\nSaid I, I had no thought of comparing my master--and was going to say\non: but he said, Don't prate, girl!--No, said she, it don't become you,\nI am sure.\n\nWell, said I, since I must not speak, I will hold my peace; but there\nis a righteous Judge, who knows the secrets of all hearts; and to him I\nappeal.\n\nSee there! said he: now this meek, good creature is praying for fire\nfrom heaven upon us! O she can curse most heartily, in the spirit of\nChristian meekness, I'll assure you!--Come, saucy-face, give me another\nglass of wine.\n\nSo I did, as well as I could; but wept so, that he said, I suppose I\nshall have some of your tears in my wine!\n\nWhen he had supped, he stood up, and said, O how happy for you it is,\nthat you can, at will, thus make your speaking eyes overflow in this\nmanner, without losing any of their brilliancy! You have been told, I\nsuppose, that you are most beautiful in your tears!--Did you ever,\nsaid he to her, (who all this while was standing in one corner of the\nparlour,) see a more charming creature than this? Is it to be wondered\nat, that I demean myself thus to take notice of her?--See, said he, and\ntook the glass with one hand, and turned me round with the other, what\na shape! what a neck! what a hand! and what a bloom on that lovely\nface!--But who can describe the tricks and artifices, that lie lurking\nin her little, plotting, guileful heart! 'Tis no wonder the poor parson\nwas infatuated with her.--I blame him less than I do her; for who could\nexpect such artifice in so young a sorceress?\n\nI went to the farther part of the room, and held my face against the\nwainscot; and in spite of all I could do to refrain crying, sobbed as\nif my heart would break. He said, I am surprised, Mrs. Jewkes, at the\nmistake of the letters you tell me of! But, you see, I am not afraid any\nbody should read what I write. I don't carry on private correspondences,\nand reveal every secret that comes to my knowledge, and then corrupt\npeople to carry my letters against their duty, and all good conscience.\n\nCome hither, hussy! said he: You and I have a dreadful reckoning to\nmake. Why don't you come, when I bid you?--Fie upon it, Mrs. Pamela,\nsaid she. What! not stir, when his honour commands you to come to\nhim!--Who knows but his goodness will forgive you?\n\nHe came to me, (for I had no power to stir,) and put his arms about my\nneck, and would kiss me; and said, Well, Mrs. Jewkes, if it were not for\nthe thought of this cursed parson, I believe in my heart, so great is my\nweakness, that I could not forgive this intriguing little slut, and take\nher to my bosom.\n\nO, said the sycophant, you are very good, sir, very forgiving,\nindeed!--But come, added the profligate wretch, I hope you will be so\ngood, as to take her to your bosom; and that, by to-morrow morning,\nyou'll bring her to a better sense of her duty!\n\nCould any thing in womanhood be so vile? I had no patience: but yet\ngrief and indignation choaked up the passage of my words; and I could\nonly stammer out a passionate exclamation to Heaven, to protect my\ninnocence. But the word was the subject of their ridicule. Was ever poor\ncreature worse beset!\n\nHe said, as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me\nor not, No, I cannot yet forgive her neither.--She has given me great\ndisturbance, has brought great discredit upon me, both abroad and at\nhome: has corrupted all my servants at the other house; has despised my\nhonourable views and intentions to her, and sought to run away with this\nungrateful parson.--And surely I ought not to forgive all this!--Yet,\nwith all this wretched grimace, he kissed me again, and would have put\nhis hand into my bosom; but I struggled, and said, I would die before I\nwould be used thus.--Consider, Pamela, said he, in a threatening tone,\nconsider where you are! and don't play the fool: If you do, a more\ndreadful fate awaits you than you expect. But take her up stairs, Mrs.\nJewkes, and I'll send a few lines to her to consider of; and let me have\nyour answer, Pamela, in the morning. 'Till then you have to resolve: and\nafter that your doom is fixed.--So I went up stairs, and gave myself up\nto grief, and expectation of what he would send: but yet I was glad of\nthis night's reprieve!\n\nHe sent me, however, nothing at all. And about twelve o'clock, Mrs.\nJewkes and Nan came up, as the night before, to be my bed-fellows: and\nI would go to bed with some of my clothes on: which they muttered at\nsadly; and Mrs. Jewkes railed at me particularly. Indeed I would have\nsat up all night, for fear, if she would have let me. For I had but very\nlittle rest that night, apprehending this woman would let my master\nin. She did nothing but praise him, and blame me: but I answered her as\nlittle as I could.\n\nHe has Sir Simon Tell-tale, alias Darnford, to dine with him to-day,\nwhose family sent to welcome him into the country; and it seems the old\nknight wants to see me; so I suppose I shall be sent for, as Samson was,\nto make sport for him.--Here I am, and must bear it all!\n\n\nTwelve o'clock, Saturday noon.\n\nJust now he has sent me up, by Mrs. Jewkes, the following proposals. So\nhere are the honourable intentions all at once laid open. They are, my\ndear parents, to make me a vile kept mistress: which, I hope, I shall\nalways detest the thoughts of. But you'll see how they are accommodated\nto what I should have most desired, could I have honestly promoted it,\nyour welfare and happiness. I have answered them, as I am sure you'll\napprove; and I am prepared for the worst: For though I fear there will\nbe nothing omitted to ruin me, and though my poor strength will not be\nable to defend me, yet I will be innocent of crime in my intention, and\nin the sight of God; and to him leave the avenging of all my wrongs,\ntime and manner. I shall write to you my answer against his articles;\nand hope the best, though I fear the worst. But if I should come home to\nyou ruined and undone, and may not be able to look you in the face; yet\npity and inspirit the poor Pamela, to make her little remnant of life\neasy; for long I shall not survive my disgrace: and you may be assured\nit shall not be my fault, if it be my misfortune.\n\n\n'To MRS. PAMELA ANDREWS.\n\n'The following ARTICLES are proposed to your serious consideration;\nand let me have an answer, in writing, to them, that I may take my\nresolutions accordingly. Only remember, that I will not be trifled with;\nand what you give for answer will absolutely decide your fate, without\nexpostulation, or farther trouble.\n\n    This is my ANSWER.\n\n    Forgive, sir, the spirit your poor servant is about to show in\n    her answer to your ARTICLES.  Not to be warm, and in earnest,\n    on such an occasion as the present, would shew a degree of guilt,\n    that, I hope, my soul abhors.  I will not trifle with you, nor\n    act like a person doubtful of her own mind; for it wants not one\n    moment's consideration with me; and I therefore return the ANSWER\n    following, let what will be the consequence.\n\n'I. If you can convince me that the hated parson has had no\nencouragement from you in his addresses; and that you have no\ninclination for him in preference to me; then I will offer the following\nproposals to you, which I will punctually make good.\n\n    I.  As to the first article, sir, it may behove me (that I may\n    not deserve, in your opinion, the opprobrious terms of forward\n    and artful, and such like) to declare solemnly, that Mr. Williams\n    never had the least encouragement from me, as to what you hint;\n    and I believe his principal motive was the apprehended duty of his\n    function, quite contrary to his apparent interest, to assist a\n    person he thought in distress.  You may, sir, the rather believe\n    me, when I declare, that I know not the man breathing I would wish\n    to marry; and that the only one I could honour more than another,\n    is the gentleman, who, of all others, seeks my everlasting dishonour.\n\n'II. I will directly make you a present of 500 guineas, for your own\nuse, which you may dispose of to any purpose you please: and will give\nit absolutely into the hands of any person you shall appoint to receive\nit; and expect no favour in return, till you are satisfied in the\npossession of it.\n\n    II.  As to your second proposal, let the consequence be what it\n    will, I reject it with all my soul.  Money, sir, is not my chief\n    good: May God Almighty desert me, whenever it is! and whenever,\n    for the sake of that, I can give up my title to that blessed hope\n    which will stand me in stead, at a time when millions of gold will\n    not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past misspent life!\n\n'III. I will likewise directly make over to you a purchase I lately made\nin Kent, which brings in 250l. per annum, clear of all deductions. This\nshall be made over to you in full property for your life, and for the\nlives of any children to perpetuity, that you may happen to have: And\nyour father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust\nfor these purposes: and the management of it will yield a comfortable\nsubsistence to him, and your mother, for life; and I will make up any\ndeficiencies, if such should happen, to that clear sum, and allow him\n50l. per annum, besides, for his life, and that of your mother, for his\ncare and management of this your estate.\n\n    III.  Your third proposal, sir, I reject for the same reason;\n    and am sorry you could think my poor honest parents would enter\n    into their part of it, and be concerned for the management of\n    an estate, which would be owing to the prostitution of their\n    poor daughter.  Forgive, sir, my warmth on this occasion; but\n    you know not the poor man, and the poor woman, my ever-dear\n    father and mother, if you think, that they would not much rather\n    choose to starve in a ditch, or rot in a noisome dungeon, than\n    accept of the fortune of a monarch, upon such wicked terms.\n    I dare not say all that my full mind suggests to me on this\n    grievous occasion--But, indeed, sir, you know them not; nor\n    shall the terrors of death, in its most frightful form, I hope,\n    through God's assisting grace, ever make me act unworthy of\n    such poor honest parents!\n\n'IV. I will, moreover, extend my favour to any other of your relations,\nthat you may think worthy of it, or that are valued by you.\n\n    IV.  Your fourth proposal, I take upon me, sir, to answer as the\n    third.  If I have any friends that want the favour of the great,\n    may they ever want it, if they are capable of desiring it on\n    unworthy terms!\n\n'V. I will, besides, order patterns to be sent you for choosing four\ncomplete suits of rich clothes, that you may appear with reputation, as\nif you were my wife. And will give you the two diamond rings, and two\npair of ear-rings, and diamond necklace, that were bought by my mother,\nto present to Miss Tomlins, if the match that was proposed between her\nand me had been brought to effect: and I will confer upon you still\nother gratuities, as I shall find myself obliged, by your good behaviour\nand affection.\n\n    V.  Fine clothes, sir, become not me; nor have I any ambition\n    to wear them.  I have greater pride in my poverty and meanness,\n    than I should have in dress and finery.  Believe me, sir, I think\n    such things less become the humble-born Pamela, than the rags\n    your good mother raised me from.  Your rings, sir, your necklace,\n    and your ear-rings, will better befit ladies of degree, than me:\n    and to lose the best jewel, my virtue, would be poorly recompensed\n    by those you propose to give me.  What should I think, when I\n    looked upon my finger, or saw in the glass those diamonds on my\n    neck, and in my ears, but that they were the price of my honesty;\n    and that I wore those jewels outwardly, because I had none inwardly.\n\n'VI. Now, Pamela, will you see by this, what a value I set upon the\nfree-will of a person already in my power; and who, if these proposals\nare not accepted, shall find, that I have not taken all these pains, and\nrisked my reputation, as I have done, without resolving to gratify my\npassion for you, at all adventures; and if you refuse, without making\nany terms at all.\n\n    VI.  I know, sir, by woful experience, that I am in your power:\n    I know all the resistance I can make will be poor and weak, and,\n    perhaps, stand me in little stead: I dread your will to ruin me\n    is as great as your power: yet, sir, will I dare to tell you,\n    that I will make no free-will offering of my virtue.  All that\n    I can do, poor as it is, I will do, to convince you, that your\n    offers shall have no part in my choice; and if I cannot escape\n    the violence of man, I hope, by God's grace, I shall have nothing\n    to reproach myself, for not doing all in my power to avoid my\n    disgrace; and then I can safely appeal to the great God, my only\n    refuge and protector, with this consolation, That my will bore no\n    part in my violation.\n\n'VII. You shall be mistress of my person and fortune, as much as if the\nfoolish ceremony had passed. All my servants shall be yours; and you\nshall choose any two persons to attend yourself, either male or female,\nwithout any control of mine: and if your conduct be such, that I have\nreason to be satisfied with it, I know not (but will not engage for\nthis) that I may, after a twelvemonth's cohabitation, marry you; for, if\nmy love increases for you, as it has done for many months past, it will\nbe impossible for me to deny you any thing.\n\n'And now, Pamela, consider well, it is in your power to oblige me on\nsuch terms, as will make yourself, and all your friends, happy: but this\nwill be over this very day, irrevocably over; and you shall find all you\nwould be thought to fear, without the least benefit arising from it to\nyourself.\n\n'And I beg you'll well weigh the matter, and comply with my proposals;\nand I will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of them:\nAnd let me, if you value yourself, experience a grateful return on this\noccasion, and I'll forgive all that's past.'\n\n    VII.  I have not once dared to look so high, as to such a\n    proposal as your seventh article contains.  Hence have proceeded\n    all my little abortive artifices to escape from the confinement\n    you have put me in; although you promised to be honourable to me.\n    Your honour, well I know, would not let you stoop to so mean and\n    so unworthy a slave, as the poor Pamela: All I desire is, to be\n    permitted to return to my native meanness unviolated.  What have\n    I done, sir, to deserve it should be otherwise?  For the obtaining\n    of this, though I would not have married your chaplain, yet would\n    I have run away with your meanest servant, if I had thought I could\n    have got safe to my beloved poverty.  I heard you once say, sir,\n    That a certain great commander, who could live upon lentils, might\n    well refuse the bribes of the greatest monarch: And I hope, as I\n    can contentedly live at the meanest rate, and think not myself\n    above the lowest condition, that I am also above making an exchange\n    of my honesty for all the riches of the Indies.  When I come to be\n    proud and vain of gaudy apparel, and outside finery, then (which I\n    hope will never be) may I rest my principal good in such vain\n    trinkets, and despise for them the more solid ornaments of a good\n    fame, and a chastity inviolate!\n\n\nGive me leave to say, sir, in answer to what you hint, That you may in\na twelvemonth's time marry me, on the continuance of my good behaviour;\nthat this weighs less with me, if possible, than any thing else you have\nsaid: for, in the first place, there is an end of all merit, and all\ngood behaviour, on my side, if I have now any, the moment I consent to\nyour proposals: And I should be so far from expecting such an honour,\nthat I will pronounce, that I should be most unworthy of it. What, sir,\nwould the world say, were you to marry your harlot? That a gentleman of\nyour rank in life should stoop, not only to the base-born Pamela, but to\na base-born prostitute?--Little, sir, as I know of the world, I am not\nto be caught by a bait so poorly covered as this!\n\nYet, after all, dreadful is the thought, that I, a poor, weak,\nfriendless, unhappy creature, am too full in your power! But permit me,\nsir, to pray, as I now write on my bended knees, That before you resolve\nupon my ruin, you will weigh well the matter. Hitherto, sir, though you\nhave taken large strides to this crying sin, yet are you on this side\nthe commission of it.--When once it is done, nothing can recall it! And\nwhere will be your triumph?--What glory will the spoils of such a weak\nenemy yield you? Let me but enjoy my poverty with honesty, is all my\nprayer, and I will bless you, and pray for you, every moment of my life!\nThink, O think! before it is yet too late! what stings, what remorse\nwill attend your dying hour, when you come to reflect, that you have\nruined, perhaps soul and body, a wretched creature, whose only pride\nwas her virtue! And how pleased you will be, on the contrary, if in\nthat tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this foul\ncrime, and to plead in your own behalf, that you suffered the earnest\nsupplications of an unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent\nyourself, and let her remain so!--May God Almighty, whose mercy so\nlately saved you from the peril of perishing in deep waters, (on which,\nI hope, you will give me cause to congratulate you!) touch your heart\nin my favour, and save you from this sin, and me from this ruin!--And\nto him do I commit my cause; and to him will I give the glory, and\nnight and day pray for you, if I may be permitted to escape this great\nevil!----\n\nYour poor oppressed, broken spirited servant.\n\n\nI took a copy of this for your perusal, my dear parents, if I shall ever\nbe so happy to see you again; (for I hope my conduct will be approved\nof by you;) and at night, when Sir Simon was gone, he sent for me down.\nWell, said he, have you considered my proposals? Yes, sir, said I, I\nhave: and there is my answer: But pray let me not see you read it. Is it\nyour bashfulness, said he, or your obstinacy, that makes you not choose\nI should read it before you?\n\nI offered to go away; and he said, Don't run from me; I won't read it\ntill you are gone. But, said he, tell me, Pamela, whether you comply\nwith my proposals, or not? Sir, said I, you will see presently; pray\ndon't hold me; for he took my hand. Said he, Did you well consider\nbefore you answered?--I did, sir, said I. If it be not what you think\nwill please me, said he, dear girl, take it back again, and reconsider\nit; for if I have this as your absolute answer, and I don't like it, you\nare undone; for I will not sue meanly, where I can command. I fear, said\nhe, it is not what I like, by your manner: and let me tell you, that I\ncannot bear denial. If the terms I have offered are not sufficient, I\nwill augment them to two-thirds of my estate; for, said he, and swore a\ndreadful oath, I cannot live without you: and, since the thing is gone\nso far, I will not! And so he clasped me in his arms in such a manner as\nquite frightened me; and kissed me two or three times.\n\nI got from him, and run up stairs, and went to the closet, and was quite\nuneasy and fearful.\n\nIn an hour's time he called Mrs. Jewkes down to him! And I heard him\nvery high in passion: and all about me! And I heard her say, It was his\nown fault; there would be an end of all my complaining and perverseness,\nif he was once resolved; and other most impudent aggravations. I am\nresolved not to go to bed this night, if I can help it!--Lie still, lie\nstill, my poor fluttering heart!--What will become of me!\n\n\nAlmost twelve o'clock, Saturday night.\n\nHe sent Mrs. Jewkes, about ten o'clock, to tell me to come to him.\nWhere? said I. I'll shew you, said she. I went down three or four steps,\nand saw her making to his chamber, the door of which was open: So I\nsaid, I cannot go there!--Don't be foolish, said she; but come; no harm\nwill be done to you!--Well, said I, if I die, I cannot go there. I heard\nhim say, Let her come, or it shall be worse for her. I can't bear,\nsaid he, to speak to her myself!--Well, said I, I cannot come, indeed I\ncannot; and so I went up again into my closet, expecting to be fetched\nby force.\n\nBut she came up soon after, and bid me make haste to bed: Said I, I will\nnot go to bed this night, that's certain!--Then, said she, you shall\nbe made to come to bed; and Nan and I will undress you. I knew neither\nprayers nor tears would move this wicked woman: So I said, I am sure you\nwill let master in, and I shall be undone! Mighty piece of undone! she\nsaid: but he was too much exasperated against me, to be so familiar with\nme, she would assure me!--Ay, said she, you'll be disposed of another\nway soon, I can tell you for your comfort: and I hope your husband will\nhave your obedience, though nobody else can have it. No husband in the\nworld, said I, shall make me do an unjust or base thing.--She said, That\nwould be soon tried; and Nan coming in, What! said I, am I to have two\nbed-fellows again, these warm nights? Yes, said she, slippery-one, you\nare, till you can have one good one instead of us. Said I, Mrs. Jewkes,\ndon't talk nastily to me: I see you are beginning again; and I shall\naffront you, may be; for next to bad actions, are bad words; for they\ncould not be spoken, if they were not in the heart.--Come to bed,\npurity! said she. You are a nonsuch, I suppose. Indeed, said I, I can't\ncome to bed; and it will do you no harm to let me stay all night in the\ngreat chair. Nan, said she, undress my young lady. If she won't let you,\nI'll help you; and, if neither of us can do it quietly, we'll call my\nmaster to do it for us; though, said she, I think it an office worthier\nof Monsieur Colbrand!--You are very wicked, said I. I know it, said she;\nI am a Jezebel, and a London prostitute, you know. You did great feats,\nsaid I, to tell my master all this poor stuff; but you did not tell him\nhow you beat me. No, lambkin, said she, (a word I had not heard a good\nwhile,) that I left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the\nvulture had not taken the wolf's part, and bid the poor innocent lamb\nbe silent!--Ay, said I, no matter for your fleers, Mrs. Jewkes; though\nI can have neither justice nor mercy here, and cannot be heard in my\ndefence, yet a time will come, may be, when I shall be heard, and when\nyour own guilt will strike you dumb.--Ay! spirit, said she; and\nthe vulture too! Must we both be dumb? Why that, lambkin, will be\npretty!--Then, said the wicked one, you'll have all the talk to\nyourself!--Then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out\ninnocence, and virtue, and honesty, till the whole trial be at an\nend!--You're a wicked woman, that's certain, said I; and if you thought\nany thing of another world, could not talk thus. But no wonder!--It\nshews what hands I'm got into!--Ay, so it does, said she; but I beg\nyou'll undress, and come to bed, or I believe your innocence won't keep\nyou from still worse hands. I will come to bed, said I, if you will let\nme have the keys in my own hand; not else, if I can help it. Yes, said\nshe, and then, hey for another contrivance, another escape!--No, no,\nsaid I, all my contrivances are over, I'll assure you! Pray let me have\nthe keys, and I will come to bed. She came to me, and took me in her\nhuge arms, as if I was a feather: Said she, I do this to shew you what\na poor resistance you can make against me, if I please to exert myself;\nand so, lambkin, don't say to your wolf, I won't come to bed!--And set\nme down, and tapped me on the neck: Ah! said she, thou art a pretty\ncreature, 'tis true; but so obstinate! so full of spirit! if thy\nstrength was but answerable to that, thou would'st run away with us all,\nand this great house too on thy back!--But, undress, undress, I tell\nyou.\n\nWell, said I, I see my misfortunes make you very merry, and very witty\ntoo: but I will love you, if you will humour me with the keys of the\nchamber-doors.--Are you sure you will love me? said she: Now speak your\nconscience!--Why, said I, you must not put it so close; neither would\nyou, if you thought you had not given reason to doubt it!--But I will\nlove you as well as I can!--I would not tell a wilful lie: and if I did,\nyou would not believe me, after your hard usage of me. Well, said she,\nthat's all fair, I own!--But Nan, pray pull off my young lady's shoes\nand stockings.--No, pray don't, said I; I will come to bed presently,\nsince I must.\n\nAnd so I went to the closet, and scribbled a little about this idle\nchit-chat. And she being importunate, I was forced to go to bed; but\nwith some of my clothes on, as the former night; and she let me hold the\ntwo keys; for there are two locks, there being a double door; and so I\ngot a little sleep that night, having had none for two or three nights\nbefore.\n\nI can't imagine what she means; but Nan offered to talk a little once\nor twice; and she snubbed her, and said, I charge you, wench, don't open\nyour lips before me; and if you are asked any questions by Mrs. Pamela,\ndon't answer her one word, while I am here!--But she is a lordly woman\nto the maid-servants; and that has always been her character: O how\nunlike good Mrs. Jervis in every thing.\n\n\nSunday morning.\n\nA thought came into my head; I meant no harm; but it was a little bold.\nFor, seeing my master dressing to go to church; and his chariot getting\nready, I went to my closet, and I writ,\n\n    The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired for a\n    gentleman of great worth and honour, who labours under a temptation\n    to exert his great power to ruin a poor, distressed, worthless\n    maiden:\n\n    And also,\n\n    The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired by a poor\n    distressed creature, for the preservation of her virtue and\n    innocence.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came up: Always writing! said she; and would see it: And\nstrait, all that ever I could say, carried it down to my master.--He\nlooked upon it, and said, Tell her, she shall soon see how her prayers\nare answered; she is very bold: but as she has rejected all my favours,\nher reckoning for all is not far off. I looked after him out of the\nwindow; and he was charmingly dressed: To be sure he is a handsome fine\ngentleman!--What pity his heart is not as good as his appearance! Why\ncan't I hate him?--But don't be uneasy, if you should see this; for it\nis impossible I should love him; for his vices all ugly him over, as I\nmay say.\n\nMy master sends word, that he shall not come home to dinner: I suppose\nhe dines with this Sir Simon Darnford. I am much concerned for poor Mr.\nWilliams. Mrs. Jewkes says, he is confined still, and takes on much. All\nhis trouble is brought upon him for my sake: This grieves me much. My\nmaster, it seems, will have his money from him. This is very hard; for\nit is three fifty pounds, he gave him, as he thought, as a salary\nfor three years that he has been with him: but there was no agreement\nbetween them; and he absolutely depended on my master's favour. To be\nsure, it was the more generous of him to run these risks for the sake\nof oppressed innocence: and I hope he will meet with his reward in\ndue time. Alas for me! I dare not plead for him; that would raise my\noppressor's jealousy more. And I have not interest to save myself!\n\n\nSunday evening.\n\nMrs. Jewkes has received a line from my master: I wonder what it is, for\nhis chariot is come home without him. But she will tell me nothing; so\nit is in vain to ask her. I am so fearful of plots and tricks, I know\nnot what to do!--Every thing I suspect; for, now my disgrace is avowed,\nwhat can I think!--To be sure, the worst will be attempted! I can only\npour out my soul in prayer to God, for his blessed protection. But, if\nI must suffer, let me not be long a mournful survivor!--Only let me not\nshorten my own time sinfully!----\n\nThis woman left upon the table, in the chamber, this letter of my\nmaster's to her; and I bolted myself in, till I had transcribed it.\nYou'll see how tremblingly, by the lines. I wish poor Mr. Williams's\nrelease at any rate; but this letter makes my heart ache. Yet I have\nanother day's reprieve, thank God!\n\n\n'MRS. JEWKES,\n\n'I have been so pressed on Williams's affair, that I shall set out this\nafternoon, in Sir Simon's chariot, and with Parson Peters, who is his\nintercessor, for Stamford; and shall not be back till to-morrow evening,\nif then. As to your ward, I am thoroughly incensed against her: She has\nwithstood her time; and now, would she sign and seal to my articles, it\nis too late. I shall discover something, perhaps, by him; and will, on\nmy return, let her know, that all her ensnaring loveliness shall not\nsave her from the fate that awaits her. But let her know nothing of\nthis, lest it put her fruitful mind upon plots and artifices. Be sure\ntrust her not without another with you at night, lest she venture the\nwindow in her foolish rashness: for I shall require her at your hands.\n\n                                                        'Yours, etc.'\n\n\nI had but just finished taking a copy of this, and laid the letter where\nI had it, and unbolted the door, when she came up in a great fright, for\nfear I should have seen it; but I being in my closet, and that lying\nas she left it, she did not mistrust. O, said she, I was afraid you had\nseen my master's letter here, which I carelessly left on the table.\nI wish, said I, I had known that. Why sure, said she, if you had, you\nwould not have offered to read my letters! Indeed, said I, I should, at\nthis time, if it had been in my way:--Do let me see it.--Well, said she,\nI wish poor Mr. Williams well off: I understand my master is gone to\nmake up matters with him; which is very good. To be sure, added she, he\nis a very good gentleman, and very forgiving!--Why, said I, as if I had\nknown nothing of the matter, how can he make up matters with him? Is not\nMr. Williams at Stamford? Yes, said she, I believe so; but Parson Peters\npleads for him, and he is gone with him to Stamford, and will not be\nback to-night: so we have nothing to do, but to eat our suppers betimes,\nand go to bed. Ay, that's pure, said I; and I shall have good rest this\nnight, I hope. So, said she, you might every night, but for your own\nidle fears. You are afraid of your friends, when none are near you. Ay,\nthat's true, said I; for I have not one near me.\n\nSo I have one more good honest night before me: What the next may be I\nknow not, and so I'll try to take in a good deal of sleep, while I can\nbe a little easy. Therefore, here I say, Good night, my dear parents;\nfor I have no more to write about this night: and though his letter\nshocks me, yet I will be as brisk as I can, that she mayn't suspect I\nhave seen it.\n\n\nTuesday night.\n\nFor the future, I will always mistrust most when appearances look\nfairest. O your poor daughter! what has she not suffered since what I\nwrote on Sunday night!--My worst trial, and my fearfullest danger! O how\nI shudder to write you an account of this wicked interval of time! For,\nmy dear parents, will you not be too much frightened and affected with\nmy distress, when I tell you, that his journey to Stamford was all\nabominable pretence! for he came home privately, and had well nigh\neffected all his vile purposes, and the ruin of your poor daughter! and\nthat by such a plot as I was not in the least apprehensive of: And,\noh! you'll hear what a vile and unwomanly part that wicked wretch, Mrs.\nJewkes, acted in it!\n\nI left off with letting you know how much I was pleased that I had one\nnight's reprieve added to my honesty. But I had less occasion to rejoice\nthan ever, as you will judge by what I have said already. Take, then,\nthe dreadful story, as well as I can relate it.\n\nThe maid Nan is a little apt to drink, if she can get at liquor; and\nMrs. Jewkes happened, or designed, as is too probable, to leave a bottle\nof cherry-brandy in her way, and the wench drank some of it more than\nshe should; and when she came in to lay the cloth, Mrs. Jewkes perceived\nit, and fell a rating at her most sadly; for she has too many faults\nof her own, to suffer any of the like sort in any body else, if she can\nhelp it; and she bid her get out of her sight, when we had supped, and\ngo to bed, to sleep off her liquor, before we came to bed. And so the\npoor maid went muttering up stairs.\n\nAbout two hours after, which was near eleven o'clock, Mrs. Jewkes and\nI went up to go to bed; I pleasing myself with what a charming night I\nshould have. We locked both doors, and saw poor Nan, as I thought, (but,\noh! 'twas my abominable master, as you shall hear by and by,) sitting\nfast asleep, in an elbow-chair, in a dark corner of the room, with her\napron thrown over her head and neck. And Mrs. Jewkes said, There is that\nbeast of a wench fast asleep, instead of being a-bed! I knew, said she,\nshe had taken a fine dose. I'll wake her, said I. No, don't, said she;\nlet her sleep on; we shall he better without her. Ay, said I, so we\nshall; but won't she get cold?\n\nSaid she, I hope you have no writing to-night. No, replied I, I will go\nto bed with you, Mrs. Jewkes. Said she, I wonder what you can find to\nwrite about so much! and am sure you have better conveniences of that\nkind, and more paper than I am aware of; and I had intended to rummage\nyou, if my master had not come down; for I spied a broken tea-cup with\nink, which gave me suspicion: but as he is come, let him look after you,\nif he will; and if you deceive him, it will be his own fault.\n\nAll this time we were undressing ourselves: And I fetched a deep sigh!\nWhat do you sigh for? said she. I am thinking, Mrs. Jewkes, answered\nI, what a sad life I live, and how hard is my lot. I am sure, the thief\nthat has robbed is much better off than I, 'bating the guilt; and I\nshould, I think, take it for a mercy, to be hanged out of the way,\nrather than live in these cruel apprehensions. So, being not sleepy, and\nin a prattling vein, I began to give a little history of myself, as I\ndid, once before, to Mrs. Jervis; in this manner:\n\nHere, said I, were my poor honest parents; they took care to instill\ngood principles into my mind, till I was almost twelve years of age;\nand taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of\nlife; and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice; for they\nwere, of late years, remarkably poor, and always as remarkably honest,\neven to a proverb: for, As honest as goodman ANDREWS, was a byeword.\n\nWell then, said I, comes my late dear good lady, and takes a fancy to\nme, and said, she would be the making of me, if I was a good girl; and\nshe put me to sing, to dance, to play on the spinnet, in order to divert\nher melancholy hours; and also taught me all manner of fine needle-work;\nbut still this was her lesson, My good Pamela, be virtuous, and keep the\nmen at a distance. Well, so I was, I hope, and so I did; and yet, though\nI say it, they all loved me and respected me; and would do any thing for\nme, as if I was a gentlewoman.\n\nBut, then, what comes next?--Why, it pleased God to take my good lady:\nand then comes my master: And what says he?--Why, in effect, it is, Be\nnot virtuous, Pamela.\n\nSo here I have lived about sixteen years in virtue and reputation; and\nall at once, when I come to know what is good, and what is evil, I must\nrenounce all the good, all the whole sixteen years' innocence, which,\nnext to God's grace, I owed chiefly to my parents, and my lady's good\nlessons and examples, and choose the evil; and so, in a moment's time,\nbecome the vilest of creatures! And all this, for what, I pray? Why,\ntruly, for a pair of diamond ear-rings, a necklace, and a diamond ring\nfor my finger; which would not become me: For a few paltry fine\nclothes, which, when I wore them, would make but my former poverty more\nridiculous to every body that saw me; especially when they knew the base\nterms I wore them upon. But, indeed, I was to have a great parcel of\nguineas beside; I forget how many; for, had there been ten times more,\nthey would have been not so much to me, as the honest six guineas you\ntricked me out of, Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nWell, forsooth! but then I was to have I know not how many pounds a year\nfor my life; and my poor father (there was the jest of it!) was to be\nthe manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter: And then, (there\nwas the jest again!) my kind, forgiving, virtuous master, would pardon\nme all my misdeeds!\n\nYes, thank him for nothing, truly. And what, pray, are all these violent\nmisdeeds?--Why, they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that\nwere taught me; and not learning a new one, that would have reversed all\nmy former: For not being contented when I was run away with, in order to\nbe ruined; but contriving, if my poor wits had been able, to get out of\ndanger, and preserve myself honest.\n\nThen was he once jealous of poor John, though he knew John was his own\ncreature, and helped to deceive me.\n\nThen was he outrageous against poor Parson Williams! and him has this\ngood, merciful master, thrown into gaol; and for what? Why, truly, for\nthat, being a divine, and a good man, he had the fear of God before his\neyes, and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest, and\nassist an oppressed poor creature.\n\nBut, to be sure, I must be forward, bold, saucy, and what not! to dare\nto run away from certain ruin, and to strive to escape from an unjust\nconfinement; and I must be married to the parson, nothing so sure!\n\nHe would have had but a poor catch of me, had I consented: But he, and\nyou too, know I did not want to marry any body. I only wanted to go to\nmy poor parents, and to have my own liberty, and not to be confined by\nsuch an unlawful restraint; and which would not have been inflicted upon\nme, but only that I am a poor, destitute, young body, and have no friend\nthat is able to right me.\n\nSo, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, here is my history in brief. And I am a very\nunhappy young creature, to be sure!--And why am I so?--Why, because my\nmaster sees something in my person that takes his present fancy; and\nbecause I would not be undone.--Why, therefore to choose, I must, and I\nshall be undone!--And this is all the reason that can be given!\n\nShe heard me run on all this time, while I was undressing, without any\ninterruption; and I said, Well, I must go to the two closets, ever since\nan affair of the closet at the other house, though he is so far off. And\nI have a good mind to wake this poor maid. No, don't, said she, I charge\nyou. I am very angry with her, and she'll get no harm there; and if she\nwakes, she may come to bed well enough, as long as there is a candle in\nthe chimney.\n\nSo I looked into the closet, and kneeled down in my own, as I used to\ndo, to say my prayers, and this with my underclothes in my hand, all\nundressed; and passed by the poor sleeping wench, as I thought, in my\nreturn. But, oh! little did I think it was my wicked, wicked master, in\na gown and petticoat of hers, and her apron over his face and shoulders.\nWhat meanness will not Lucifer make his votaries stoop to, to gain their\nabominable ends!\n\nMrs. Jewkes, by this time, was got to bed, on the farther side, as she\nused to be; and, to make room for the maid, when she should awake, I got\ninto bed, and lay close to her. And I said, Where are the keys? though,\nsaid I, I am not so much afraid to-night. Here, said the wicked woman,\nput your arm under mine, and you shall find them about my wrist, as they\nused to be. So I did, and the abominable designer held my hand with her\nright-hand, as my right-arm was under her left.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour, I said, There's poor Nan awake; I\nhear her stir. Let us go to sleep, said she, and not mind her: she'll\ncome to bed, when she's quite awake. Poor soul! said I, I'll warrant she\nwill have the head-ache finely to-morrow for this! Be silent, said\nshe, and go to sleep; you keep me awake; and I never found you in so\ntalkative a humour in my life. Don't chide me, said I; I will but say\none thing more: Do you think Nan could hear me talk of my master's\noffers? No, no, said she; she was dead asleep. I'm glad of that, said I;\nbecause I would not expose my master to his common servants; and I knew\nyou were no stranger to his fine articles. Said she, I think they were\nfine articles, and you were bewitched you did not close with them: But\nlet us go to sleep. So I was silent; and the pretended Nan (O wicked,\nbase, villanous designer! what a plot, what an unexpected plot was\nthis!) seemed to be awaking; and Mrs. Jewkes, abhorrent creature! said,\nCome, Nan!--what, are you awake at last?--Pr'ythee come to bed; for Mrs.\nPamela is in a talking fit, and won't go to sleep one while.\n\nAt that, the pretended she came to the bed side; and, sitting down in\na chair, where the curtain hid her, began to undress. Said I, Poor Mrs.\nAnne, I warrant your head aches most sadly! How do you do?\n\n--She answered not a word. Said the superlatively wicked woman, You know\nI have ordered her not to answer you. And this plot, to be sure, was\nlaid when she gave her these orders the night before.\n\nI heard her, as I thought, breathe all quick and short : Indeed, said I,\nMrs. Jewkes, the poor maid is not well. What ails you, Mrs. Anne? And\nstill no answer was made.\n\nBut, I tremble to relate it! the pretended she came into bed, but\ntrembled like an aspen-leaf; and I, poor fool that I was! pitied her\nmuch--but well might the barbarous deceiver tremble at his vile\ndissimulation, and base designs.\n\nWhat words shall I find, my dear mother (for my father should not see\nthis shocking part), to describe the rest, and my confusion, when the\nguilty wretch took my left arm, and laid it under his neck, and the vile\nprocuress held my right ; and then he clasped me round the waist!\n\nSaid I, is the wench mad ? Why, how now, confidence! thinking still it\nhad been Nan. But he kissed me with frightful vehemence; and then his\nvoice broke upon me like a clap of thunder. Now, Pamela, said he, is the\ndreadful time of reckoning come, that I have threatened--I screamed out\nin such a manner, as never anybody heard the like. But there was nobody\nto help me : and both my hands were secured, as I said. Sure never poor\nsoul was in such agonies as I. Wicked man! said I ; wicked abominable\nwoman! O God! my God! this time! this one time! deliver me from\nthis distress! or strike me dead this moment! And then I screamed\nagain and again.\n\nSays he, One word with you, Pamela; one word hear me but; I must say one\nword to you, it is this: You see now you are in my power!--You cannot\nget from me, nor help yourself: Yet have I not offered any thing amiss\nto you. But if you resolve not to comply with my proposals, I will not\nlose this opportunity: If you do, I will yet leave you.\n\nO sir, said I, leave me, leave me but, and I will do any thing I ought\nto do.--Swear then to me, said he, that you will accept my proposals!\nWith struggling, fright, terror, I fainted away quite, and did not come\nto myself soon, so that they both, from the cold sweats that I was in,\nthought me dying.--And I remember no more, than that, when with great\ndifficulty they brought me to myself, she was sitting on one side of the\nbed, with her clothes on; and he on the other with his, and in his gown\nand slippers.\n\nYour poor Pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her\ndeplorable state of death. And when I saw them there, I sat up in my\nbed, without any regard to what appearance I made, and nothing about my\nneck; and he soothing me, with an aspect of pity and concern, I put my\nhand to his mouth, and said, O tell me, yet tell me not, what have I\nsuffered in this distress? And I talked quite wild, and knew not what:\nfor, to be sure, I was on the point of distraction.\n\nHe most solemnly, and with a bitter imprecation, vowed, that he had\nnot offered the least indecency; that he was frightened at the terrible\nmanner I was taken with the fit: that he should desist from his attempt;\nand begged but to see me easy and quiet, and he would leave me directly,\nand go to his own bed. O then, said I, take with you this most wicked\nwoman, this vile Mrs. Jewkes, as an earnest, that I may believe you!\n\nAnd will you, sir, said the wicked wretch, for a fit or two, give up\nsuch an opportunity as this?--I thought you had known the sex better.\nShe is now, you see, quite well again!\n\nThis I heard; more she might say; but I fainted away once more, at these\nwords, and at his clasping his arms about me again. And, when I came\na little to myself, I saw him sit there, and the maid Nan, holding a\nsmelling-bottle to my nose, and no Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nHe said, taking my hand, Now will I vow to you, my dear Pamela, that\nI will leave you the moment I see you better, and pacified. Here's Nan\nknows, and will tell you, my concern for you. I vow to God, I have\nnot offered any indecency to you: and, since I found Mrs. Jewkes so\noffensive to you, I have sent her to the maid's bed, and the maid\nshall be with you to-night. And but promise me, that you will compose\nyourself, and I will leave you. But, said I, will not Nan also hold my\nhand? And will not she let you come in again to me?--He said, By heaven!\nI will not come in again to-night. Nan, undress yourself, go to bed, and\ndo all you can to comfort the dear creature: And now, Pamela, said he,\ngive me but your hand, and say you forgive me, and I will leave you to\nyour repose. I held out my trembling hand, which he vouchsafed to kiss;\nand I said, God forgive you, sir, as you have been just in my distress;\nand as you will be just to what you promise! And he withdrew, with a\ncountenance of remorse, as I hoped; and she shut the doors, and, at my\nrequest, brought the keys to bed.\n\nThis, O my dear parents! was a most dreadful trial. I tremble still to\nthink of it; and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it. I\nhope, as he assures me, he was not guilty of indecency; but have reason\nto bless God, who, by disabling me in my faculties, empowered me to\npreserve my innocence; and, when all my strength would have signified\nnothing, magnified himself in my weakness.\n\nI was so weak all day on Monday, that I could not get out of my bed. My\nmaster shewed great tenderness for me; and I hope he is really sorry,\nand that this will be his last attempt; but he does not say so neither.\n\nHe came in the morning, as soon as he heard the door open and I began to\nbe fearful. He stopped short of the bed, and said, Rather than give you\napprehensions, I will come no farther. I said, Your honour, sir, and\nyour mercy, is all I have to beg. He sat himself on the side of the bed,\nand asked kindly, how I did?--begged me to be composed; said, I still\nlooked a little wildly. And I said, Pray, good sir, let me not see this\ninfamous Mrs. Jewkes; I doubt I cannot bear her sight. She shan't come\nnear you all this day, if you'll promise to compose yourself. Then,\nsir, I will try. He pressed my hand very tenderly, and went out. What a\nchange does this shew!--O may it be lasting!--But, alas! he seems only\nto have altered his method of proceeding; and retains, I doubt, his\nwicked purpose.\n\nOn Tuesday, about ten o'clock, when my master heard I was up, he sent\nfor me down into the parlour. As soon as he saw me, he said, Come nearer\nto me, Pamela. I did so, and he took my hand, and said, You begin to\nlook well again: I am glad of it. You little slut, how did you frighten\nme on Sunday night.\n\nSir, said I, pray name not that night; and my eyes overflowed at the\nremembrance, and I turned my head aside.\n\nSaid he, Place some little confidence in me: I know what those charming\neyes mean, and you shall not need to explain yourself: for I do assure\nyou, that as soon as I saw you change, and a cold sweat bedew your\npretty face, and you fainted away, I quitted the bed, and Mrs. Jewkes\ndid so too. And I put on my gown, and she fetched her smelling-bottle,\nand we both did all we could to restore you; and my passion for you was\nall swallowed up in the concern I had for your recovery; for I thought\nI never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life: and feared we should\nnot bring you to life again; for what I saw you in once before was\nnothing to it. This, said he, might be my folly, and my unacquaintedness\nwith what passion your sex can shew when they are in earnest. But this\nI repeat to you, that your mind may be entirely comforted--Whatever I\noffered to you, was before you fainted away, and that, I am sure, was\ninnocent.\n\nSir, said I, that was very bad: and it was too plain you had the worst\ndesigns. When, said he, I tell you the truth in one instance, you may\nbelieve me in the other. I know not, I declare, beyond this lovely\nbosom, your sex: but that I did intend what you call the worst is most\ncertain: and though I would not too much alarm you now, I could curse my\nweakness, and my folly, which makes me own, that I love you beyond all\nyour sex, and cannot live without you. But if I am master of myself, and\nmy own resolution, I will not attempt to force you to any thing again.\n\nSir, said I, you may easily keep your resolution, if you'll send me out\nof your way, to my poor parents; that is all I beg.\n\n'Tis a folly to talk of it, said he. You must not, shall not go! And\nif I could be assured you would not attempt it, you should have better\nusage, and your confinement should be made easier to you.\n\nBut to what end, sir, am I to stay? said I: You yourself seem not sure\nyou can keep your own present good resolutions; and do you think, if I\nwas to stay, when I could get away, and be safe, it would not look,\nas if either I confided too much in my own strength, or would tempt my\nruin? And as if I was not in earnest to wish myself safe, and out of\ndanger?--And then, how long am I to stay? And to what purpose? And\nin what light must I appear to the world? Would not that censure me,\nalthough I might be innocent? And you will allow, sir, that, if there be\nany thing valuable or exemplary in a good name, or fair reputation, one\nmust not despise the world's censure, if one can avoid it.\n\nWell, said he, I sent not for you on this account, just now; but for two\nreasons. The first is, That you promise me, that for a fortnight to come\nyou will not offer to go away without my express consent; and this I\nexpect for your own sake, that I may give you a little more liberty. And\nthe second is, That you will see and forgive Mrs. Jewkes: she takes\non much, and thinks that, as all her fault was her obedience to me,\nit would be very hard to sacrifice her, as she calls it, to your\nresentment.\n\nAs to the first, sir, said I, it is a hard injunction, for the reasons\nI have mentioned. And as to the second, considering her vile, unwomanly\nwickedness, and her endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me, when\nyour returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me, it is\nstill harder. But, to shew my obedience to your commands, (for you know,\nmy dear parents, I might as well make a merit of my compliance, when\nmy refusal would stand me in no stead,) I will consent to both; and to\nevery thing else, that you shall be pleased to enjoin, which I can do,\nwith innocence.\n\nThat's my good girl! said he, and kissed me: This is quite prudent, and\nshews me, that you don't take insolent advantage of my favour for you;\nand will, perhaps, stand you in more stead than you are aware of.\n\nSo he rung the bell, and said, Call down Mrs. Jewkes. She came down,\nand he took my hand, and put it into hers; and said, Mrs. Jewkes, I am\nobliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me; but Pamela, I\nmust own, is not; because the service I employed you in was not so very\nobliging to her, as I could have wished she would have thought it: and\nyou were not to favour her, but obey me. But yet I'll assure you, at the\nvery first word, she has once obliged me, by consenting to be friends\nwith you; and if she gives me no great cause, I shall not, perhaps, put\nyou on such disagreeable service again.--Now, therefore, be you once\nmore bed-fellows and board-fellows, as I may say, for some days longer;\nand see that Pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house, nor\nkeeps a correspondence unknown to me, especially with that Williams;\nand, as for the rest, shew the dear girl all the respect that is due to\none I must love, if she will deserve it, as I hope she will yet; and let\nher be under no unnecessary or harsh restraints. But your watchful care\nis not, however, to cease: and remember that you are not to disoblige\nme, to oblige her; and that I will not, cannot, yet part with her.\n\nMrs. Jewkes looked very sullen, and as if she would be glad still to do\nme a good turn, if it lay in her power.\n\nI took courage then to drop a word or two for poor Mr. Williams; but he\nwas angry with me for it, and said he could not endure to hear his name\nin my mouth; so I was forced to have done for that time.\n\nAll this time, my papers, that I buried under the rose-bush, lay there\nstill; and I begged for leave to send a letter to you. So I should, he\nsaid, if he might read it first. But this did not answer my design; and\nyet I would have sent you such a letter as he might see, if I had been\nsure my danger was over. But that I cannot; for he now seems to take\nanother method, and what I am more afraid of, because, may be, he may\nwatch an opportunity, and join force with it, on occasion, when I am\nleast prepared: for now he seems to abound with kindness, and talks\nof love without reserve, and makes nothing of allowing himself in the\nliberty of kissing me, which he calls innocent; but which I do not like,\nand especially in the manner he does it: but for a master to do it at\nall to a servant, has meaning too much in it, not to alarm an honest\nbody.\n\n\nWednesday morning.\n\nI find I am watched and suspected still very close; and I wish I was\nwith you; but that must not be, it seems, this fortnight. I don't like\nthis fortnight; and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me, I\ndoubt.\n\nMy master just now sent for me down to take a walk with him in the\ngarden: but I like him not at all, nor his ways; for he would have, all\nthe way, his arm about my waist, and said abundance of fond things to\nme, enough to make me proud, if his design had not been apparent. After\nwalking about, he led me into a little alcove, on the farther part of\nthe garden; and really made me afraid of myself, for he began to be very\nteasing, and made me sit on his knee; and was so often kissing me, that\nI said, Sir, I don't like to be here at all, I assure you. Indeed you\nmake me afraid!--And what made me the more so, was what he once said\nto Mrs. Jewkes, and did not think I heard him, and which, though always\nuppermost with me, I did not mention before, because I did not know how\nto bring it in, in my writing.\n\nShe, I suppose, had been encouraging him in his wickedness; for it was\nbefore the last dreadful trial: and I only heard what he answered.\n\nSaid he, I will try once more; but I have begun wrong for I see terror\ndoes but add to her frost; but she is a charming girl, and may be thawed\nby kindness; and I should have melted her by love, instead of freezing\nher by fear.\n\nIs he not a wicked, sad man for this?--To be sure, I blush while I write\nit. But I trust, that that God, who has delivered me from the paw of the\nlion and the bear; that is, his and Mrs. Jewkes's violences, will soon\ndeliver me from this Philistine, that I may not defy the commands of the\nliving God!\n\nBut, as I was saying, this expression coming into my thoughts, I was\nof opinion, I could not be too much on my guard, at all times: more\nespecially when he took such liberties: for he professed honour all the\ntime with his mouth, while his actions did not correspond. I begged and\nprayed he would let me go: and had I not appeared quite regardless of\nall he said, and resolved not to stay, if I could help it, I know not\nhow far he would have proceeded; for I was forced to fall down upon my\nknees.\n\nAt last he walked out with me, still bragging of his honour and his\nlove. Yes, yes, sir, said I, your honour is to destroy mine: and your\nlove is to ruin me; I see it too plainly. But, indeed, I will not talk\nwith you, sir, said I, any more. Do you know, said he, whom you talk to,\nand where you are?\n\nYou may believe I had reason to think him not so decent as he should be;\nfor I said, As to where I am, sir, I know it too well; and that I have\nno creature to befriend me: and, as to whom I talk to, sir, let me ask\nyou, What you would have me answer?\n\nWhy, tell me, said he, what answer you would make? It will only make you\nangry, said I; and so I shall fare worse, if possible. I won't be angry,\nsaid he. Why, then, sir, said I, you cannot be my late good lady's son;\nfor she loved me, and taught me virtue. You cannot then be my master;\nfor no master demeans himself so to his poor servant.\n\nHe put his arm round me, and his other hand on my neck, which made\nme more angry and bold: and he said, What then am I? Why, said I,\n(struggling from him, and in a great passion,) to be sure you are\nLucifer himself, in the shape of my master, or you could not use me\nthus. These are too great liberties, said he, in anger; and I desire\nthat you will not repeat them, for your own sake: For if you have no\ndecency towards me, I'll have none towards you.\n\nI was running from him, and he said, Come back, when I bid you.--So,\nknowing every place was alike dangerous to me, and I had nobody to run\nto, I came back, at his call; and seeing him look displeased, I held my\nhands together, and wept, and said, Pray, sir, forgive me. No, said he,\nrather say, Pray, Lucifer, forgive me! And, now, since you take me for\nthe devil, how can you expect any good from me?--How, rather, can you\nexpect any thing but the worst treatment from me?--You have given me a\ncharacter, Pamela; and blame me not that I act up to it. Sir, said I,\nlet me beg you to forgive me: I am really sorry for my boldness; but\nindeed you don't use me like a gentleman: and how can I express my\nresentment, if I mince the matter, while you are so indecent? Precise\nfool! said he, what indecencies have I offered you?--I was bewitched\nI had not gone through my purpose last Sunday night; and then your\nlicentious tongue had not given the worst name to little puny freedoms,\nthat shew my love and my folly at the same time. But, begone! said he,\ntaking my hand, and tossing it from him, and learn another conduct and\nmore wit; and I will lay aside my foolish regard for you, and assert\nmyself. Begone! said he, again, with a haughty air.\n\nIndeed, sir, said I, I cannot go, till you pardon me, which I beg on my\nbended knees. I am truly sorry for my boldness.--But I see how you go\non: you creep by little and little upon me; and now soothe me, and now\nthreaten me; and if I should forbear to shew my resentment, when you\noffer incivilities to me, would not that be to be lost by degrees? Would\nit not shew, that I could bear any thing from you, if I did not express\nall the indignation I could express, at the first approaches you make to\nwhat I dread? And have you not as good as avowed my ruin?--And have you\nonce made me hope you will quit your purposes against me? How then, sir,\ncan I act, but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards\nmy undoing? And what is left me but words?--And can these words be other\nthan such strong ones, as shall shew the detestation which, from the\nbottom of my heart, I have for every attempt upon my virtue? Judge for\nme, sir, and pardon me.\n\nPardon you! said he, What! when you don't repent?--When you have the\nboldness to justify yourself in your fault? Why don't you say, you never\nwill again offend me? I will endeavour, sir, said I, always to preserve\nthat decency towards you which becomes me. But really, sir, I must beg\nyour excuse for saying, That when you forget what belongs to decency\nin your actions, and when words are all that are left me, to shew my\nresentment of such actions, I will not promise to forbear the strongest\nexpressions that my distressed mind shall suggest to me: nor shall your\nangriest frowns deter me, when my honesty is in question.\n\nWhat, then, said he, do you beg pardon for? Where is the promise of\namendment, for which I should forgive you? Indeed, sir, said I, I own\nthat must absolutely depend on your usage of me: for I will bear any\nthing you can inflict upon me with patience, even to the laying down\nof my life, to shew my obedience to you in other cases; but I cannot be\npatient, I cannot be passive, when my virtue is at stake! It would be\ncriminal in me, if I was.\n\nHe said, he never saw such a fool in his life. And he walked by the side\nof me some yards, without saying a word, and seemed vexed; and at last\nwalked in, bidding me attend him in the garden, after dinner. So having\na little time, I went up, and wrote thus far.\n\n\nWednesday night.\n\nIf, my dear parents, I am not destined more surely than ever for ruin,\nI have now more comfort before me than ever I yet knew: and am either\nnearer my happiness, or my misery, than ever I was. God protect me from\nthe latter, if it be his blessed will! I have now such a scene to open\nto you, that, I know, will alarm both your hopes and your fears, as it\ndoes mine. And this it is:\n\nAfter my master had dined, he took a turn into the stables, to look at\nhis stud of horses; and, when he came in, he opened the parlour-door,\nwhere Mrs. Jewkes and I sat at dinner; and, at his entrance, we both\nrose up; but he said, Sit still, sit still, and let me see how you eat\nyour victuals, Pamela. O, said Mrs. Jewkes, very poorly, indeed, sir!\nNo, said I, pretty well, sir, considering. None of your considerings,\nsaid he, pretty face; and tapped me on the cheek. I blushed, but was\nglad he was so good-humoured; but I could not tell how to sit before\nhim, nor to behave myself. So he said, I know, Pamela, you are a nice\ncarver: my mother used to say so. My lady, sir, said I, was very good to\nme in every thing, and would always make me do the honours of her table\nfor her, when she was with her few select friends that she loved. Cut\nup, said he, that chicken. I did so. Now, said he, and took a knife and\nfork, and put a wing upon my plate, let me see you eat that. O sir, said\nI, I have eaten a whole breast of a chicken already, and cannot eat so\nmuch. But he said, I must eat it for his sake, and he would teach me to\neat heartily: So I did eat it; but was much confused at his so kind and\nunusual freedom and condescension. And, good lack! you can't imagine how\nMrs. Jewkes looked and stared, and how respectful she seemed to me, and\ncalled me good madam, I'll assure you, urging me to take a little bit of\ntart.\n\nMy master took two or three turns about the room, musing and thoughtful,\nas I had never before seen him; and at last he went out, saying, I\nam going into the garden: You know, Pamela, what I said to you before\ndinner. I rose, and courtesied, saying, I would attend his honour; and\nhe said, Do, good girl!\n\nWell, said Mrs. Jewkes, I see how things will go. O, madam, as she\ncalled me again, I am sure you are to be our mistress! And then I know\nwhat will become of me. Ah Mrs. Jewkes, said I, if I can but keep myself\nvirtuous, 'tis the most of my ambition; and I hope, no temptation shall\nmake me otherwise.\n\nNotwithstanding I had no reason to be pleased with his treatment of me\nbefore dinner, yet I made haste to attend him; and I found him walking\nby the side of that pond, which, for want of grace, and through a sinful\ndespondence, had like to have been so fatal to me, and the sight of\nwhich, ever since, has been a trouble and reproach to me. And it was\nby the side of this pond, and not far from the place where I had that\ndreaded conflict, that my present hopes, if I am not to be deceived\nagain, began to dawn: which I presume to flatter myself with being\na happy omen for me, as if God Almighty would shew your poor sinful\ndaughter, how well I did to put my affiance in his goodness, and not\nto throw away myself, because my ruin seemed inevitable, to my\nshort-sighted apprehension.\n\nSo he was pleased to say, Well, Pamela, I am glad you are come of your\nown accord, as I may say: give me your hand. I did so; and he looked\nat me very steadily, and pressing my hand all the time, at last said, I\nwill now talk to you in a serious manner.\n\nYou have a good deal of wit, a great deal of penetration, much beyond\nyour years, and, as I thought, your opportunities. You are possessed\nof an open, frank, and generous mind; and a person so lovely, that you\nexcel all your sex, in my eyes. All these accomplishments have engaged\nmy affection so deeply, that, as I have often said, I cannot live\nwithout you; and I would divide, with all my soul, my estate with you,\nto make you mine upon my own terms. These you have absolutely rejected;\nand that, though in saucy terms enough, yet in such a manner as makes\nme admire you the more. Your pretty chit-chat to Mrs. Jewkes, the last\nSunday night, so innocent, and so full of beautiful simplicity, half\ndisarmed my resolution before I approached your bed: And I see you so\nwatchful over your virtue, that though I hoped to find it otherwise, I\ncannot but confess my passion for you is increased by it. But now,\nwhat shall I say farther, Pamela?--I will make you, though a party, my\nadviser in this matter, though not, perhaps, my definitive judge.\n\nYou know I am not a very abandoned profligate; I have hitherto been\nguilty of no very enormous or vile actions. This of seizing you, and\nconfining you thus, may perhaps be one of the worst, at least to persons\nof real innocence. Had I been utterly given up to my passions, I should\nbefore now have gratified them, and not have shewn that remorse and\ncompassion for you, which have reprieved you, more than once, when\nabsolutely in my power; and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were\nwhen you came into my house.\n\nBut what can I do? Consider the pride of my condition. I cannot endure\nthe thought of marriage, even with a person of equal or superior degree\nto myself; and have declined several proposals of that kind: How then,\nwith the distance between us in the world's judgment, can I think of\nmaking you my wife?--Yet I must have you; I cannot bear the thoughts\nof any other man supplanting me in your affections: and the very\napprehension of that has made me hate the name of Williams, and use him\nin a manner unworthy of my temper.\n\nNow, Pamela, judge for me; and, since I have told you, thus candidly, my\nmind, and I see yours is big with some important meaning, by your eyes,\nyour blushes, and that sweet confusion which I behold struggling in your\nbosom, tell me, with like openness and candour, what you think I ought\nto do, and what you would have me do.\n\nIt is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind, on this\nunexpected declaration, so contrary to his former behaviour. His manner\ntoo had something so noble, and so sincere, as I thought, that, alas for\nme! I found I had need of all my poor discretion, to ward off the blow\nwhich this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts. I threw myself at\nhis feet; for I trembled, and could hardly stand: O sir, said I, spare\nyour poor servant's confusion! O spare the poor Pamela!--Speak out, said\nhe, and tell me, when I bid you, What you think I ought to do? I cannot\nsay what you ought to do, answered I: but I only beg you will not ruin\nme; and, if you think me virtuous, if you think me sincerely honest, let\nme go to my poor parents. I will vow to you, that I will never suffer\nmyself to be engaged without your approbation.\n\nStill he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question, of what\nI thought he ought to do. And I did, As to my poor thoughts of what you\nought to do, I must needs say, that indeed I think you ought to regard\nthe world's opinion, and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your birth\nand fortune; and, therefore, if you really honour the poor Pamela with\nyour respect, a little time, absence, and the conversation of worthier\npersons of my sex, will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so\nunworthy your condition: And this, good sir, is the best advice I can\noffer.\n\nCharming creature! lovely Pamela! said he, (with an ardour that was\nnever before so agreeable to me,) this generous manner is of a piece\nwith all the rest of your conduct. But tell me, still more explicitly,\nwhat you would advise me to, in the case.\n\nO, sir! said I, take not advantage of my credulity, and these my weak\nmoments: but were I the first lady in the land, instead of the poor\nabject Pamela, I would, I could tell you. But I can say no more--\n\nO my dear father and mother! now I know you will indeed be concerned for\nme;--for now I am for myself.--And now I begin to be afraid I know\ntoo well the reason why all his hard trials of me, and my black\napprehensions, would not let me hate him.\n\nBut be assured still, by God's grace, that I shall do nothing unworthy\nof your Pamela; and if I find that he is still capable of deceiving me,\nand that this conduct is only put on to delude me more, I shall think\nnothing in this world so vile, and so odious; and nothing, if he be\nnot the worst of his kind, (as he says, and, I hope, he is not,) so\ndesperately guileful, as the heart of man.\n\nHe generously said, I will spare your confusion, Pamela. But I hope I\nmay promise myself, that you can love me preferably to any other man;\nand that no one in the world has had any share in your affections; for\nI am very jealous of what I love; and if I thought you had a secret\nwhispering in your soul, that had not yet come up to a wish, for any\nother man breathing, I should not forgive myself to persist in my\naffection for you; nor you, if you did not frankly acquaint me with it.\n\nAs I still continued on my knees, on the grass border by the pond-side,\nhe sat himself down on the grass by me, and took me in his arms: Why\nhesitates my Pamela? said he.--Can you not answer me with truth, as I\nwish? If you cannot, speak, and I will forgive you.\n\nO good sir, said I, it is not that; indeed it is not: but a frightful\nword or two that you said to Mrs. Jewkes, when you thought I was not\nin hearing, comes cross my mind; and makes me dread that I am in more\ndanger than ever I was in my life.\n\nYou have never found me a common liar, said he, (too fearful and foolish\nPamela!) nor will I answer how long I may hold in my present mind; for\nmy pride struggles hard within me, I'll assure you; and if you doubt me,\nI have no obligation to your confidence or opinion. But, at present, I\nam really sincere in what I say: And I expect you will be so too; and\nanswer directly my question.\n\nI find, sir, said I, I know not myself; and your question is of such a\nnature, that I only want to tell you what I heard, and to have your kind\nanswer to it; or else, what I have to say to your question, may pave the\nway to my ruin, and shew a weakness that I did not believe was in me.\n\nWell, said he, you may say what you have overheard; for, in not\nanswering me directly, you put my soul upon the rack; and half the\ntrouble I have had with you would have brought to my arms one of the\nfinest ladies in England.\n\nO sir, said I, my virtue is as dear to me, as if I was of the highest\nquality; and my doubts (for which you know I have had too much reason)\nhave made me troublesome. But now, sir, I will tell you what I heard,\nwhich has given me great uneasiness.\n\nYou talked to Mrs. Jewkes of having begun wrong with me, in trying to\nsubdue me with terror, and of frost, and such like--You remember it\nwell:--And that you would, for the future, change your conduct, and try\nto melt me, that was your word, by kindness.\n\nI fear not, sir, the grace of God supporting me, that any acts of\nkindness would make me forget what I owe to my virtue: but, sir, I may,\nI find, be made more miserable by such acts, than by terror; because my\nnature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ungrateful: and if I\nshould be taught a lesson I never yet learnt, with what regret should\nI descend to the grave, to think that I could not hate my undoer: and\nthat, at the last great day, I must stand up as an accuser of the poor\nunhappy soul, that I could wish it in my power to save!\n\nExalted girl! said he, what a thought is that!--Why, now, Pamela, you\nexcel yourself! You have given me a hint that will hold me long. But,\nsweet creature, said he, tell me what is this lesson, which you never\nyet learnt, and which you are so afraid of learning?\n\nIf, sir, said I, you will again generously spare my confusion, I need\nnot speak it: But this I will say, in answer to the question you seem\nmost solicitous about, that I know not the man breathing that I would\nwish to be married to, or that ever I thought of with such an idea. I\nhad brought my mind so to love poverty, that I hoped for nothing but to\nreturn to the best, though the poorest of parents; and to employ myself\nin serving God, and comforting them; and you know not, sir, how you\ndisappointed those hopes, and my proposed honest pleasures, when you\nsent me hither.\n\nWell then, said he, I may promise myself, that neither the parson, nor\nany other man, is any the least secret motive to your steadfast refusal\nof my offers? Indeed, sir, said I, you may; and, as you was pleased to\nask, I answer, that I have not the least shadow of a wish, or thought,\nfor any man living.\n\nBut, said he, (for I am foolishly jealous, and yet it shews my fondness\nfor you,) have you not encouraged Williams to think you will have him?\nIndeed, sir, said I, I have not; but the very contrary. And would you\nnot have had him, said he, if you had got away by his means? I had\nresolved, sir, said I, in my mind, otherwise; and he knew it; and the\npoor man--I charge you, said he, say not a word in his favour! You will\nexcite a whirlwind in my soul, if you name him with kindness; and then\nyou'll be borne away with the tempest.\n\nSir, said I, I have done!--Nay, said he, but do not have done; let me\nknow the whole. If you have any regard for him, speak out; for it\nwould end fearfully for you, for me, and for him, if I found that you\ndisguised any secret of your soul from me, in this nice particular.\n\nSir, said I, if I have ever given you cause to think me sincere--Say\nthen, said he, interrupting me with great vehemence, and taking both my\nhands between his, Say, that you now, in the presence of God, declare\nthat you have not any the most hidden regard for Williams, or any other\nman.\n\nSir, said I, I do. As God shall bless me, and preserve my innocence,\nI have not. Well, said he, I will believe you, Pamela; and in time,\nperhaps, I may better bear that man's name. And, if I am convinced that\nyou are not prepossessed, my vanity makes me assured, that I need not\nto fear a place in your esteem, equal, if not preferable, to any man in\nEngland. But yet it stings my pride to the quick, that you was so easily\nbrought, and at such a short acquaintance, to run away with that college\nnovice!\n\nO good sir, said I, may I be heard one thing? And though I bring upon me\nyour highest indignation, I will tell you, perhaps, the unnecessary and\nimprudent, but yet the whole truth.\n\nMy honesty (I am poor and lowly, and am not entitled to call it honour)\nwas in danger. I saw no means of securing myself from your avowed\nattempts. You had shewed you would not stick at little matters; and\nwhat, sir, could any body have thought of my sincerity, in preferring\nthat to all other considerations, if I had not escaped from these\ndangers, if I could have found any way for it?--I am not going to say\nany thing for him; but, indeed, indeed, sir, I was the cause of putting\nhim upon assisting me in my escape. I got him to acquaint me what gentry\nthere were in the neighbourhood that I might fly to; and prevailed\nupon him--Don't frown at me, good sir; for I must tell you the whole\ntruth--to apply to one Lady Jones; to Lady Darnford; and he was so good\nto apply to Mr. Peters, the minister: But they all refused me; and then\nit was he let me know, that there was no honourable way but marriage.\nThat I declined; and he agreed to assist me for God's sake.\n\nNow, said he, you are going--I boldly put my hand before his mouth,\nhardly knowing the liberty I took: Pray, sir, said I, don't be angry;\nI have just done--I would only say, that rather than have staid to be\nruined, I would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the\nworld saw, if I thought him honest.--And I hope, when you duly weigh all\nmatters, you will forgive me, and not think me so bold, and so forward,\nas you have been pleased to call me.\n\nWell, said he, even in this your last speech, which, let me tell you,\nshews more your honesty of heart than your prudence, you have not\nover-much pleased me. But I must love you; and that vexes me not a\nlittle. But tell me, Pamela, for now the former question recurs: Since\nyou so much prize your honour, and your virtue; since all attempts\nagainst that are so odious to you; and since I have avowedly made\nseveral of these attempts, do you think it is possible for you to love\nme preferably to any other of my sex?\n\nAh, sir! said I, and here my doubt recurs, that you may thus graciously\nuse me, to take advantage of my credulity.\n\nStill perverse and doubting! said he--Cannot you take me as I am at\npresent? And that, I have told you, is sincere and undesigning, whatever\nI may be hereafter.\n\nAh, sir! replied I, what can I say? I have already said too much, if\nthis dreadful hereafter should take place. Don't bid me say how well I\ncan--And then, my face glowing as the fire, I, all abashed, leaned upon\nhis shoulder, to hide my confusion.\n\nHe clasped me to him with great ardour, and said, Hide your dear face in\nmy bosom, my beloved Pamela! your innocent freedoms charm me!--But then\nsay, How well--what?\n\nIf you will be good, said I, to your poor servant, and spare her, I\ncannot say too much! But if not, I am doubly undone!--Undone indeed!\n\nSaid he, I hope my present temper will hold; for I tell you frankly,\nthat I have known, in this agreeable hour, more sincere pleasure than\nI have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul\ncompelled me into, in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms. And,\nPamela, you must pray for the continuance of this temper; and I hope\nyour prayers will get the better of my temptations.\n\nThis sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves. I threw myself at his\nfeet, and embraced his knees: What pleasure, sir, you give me at these\ngracious words, is not lent your poor servant to express!--I shall be\ntoo much rewarded for all my sufferings, if this goodness hold! God\ngrant it may, for your own soul's sake as well as mine. And oh! how\nhappy should I be, if----\n\nHe stopt me, and said, But, my dear girl, what must we do about the\nworld, and the world's censure? Indeed, I cannot marry!\n\nNow was I again struck all of a heap. However, soon recollecting myself,\nSir, said I, I have not the presumption to hope such an honour. If I may\nbe permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents, to pray\nfor you there, it is all I at present request! This, sir, after all my\napprehensions and dangers, will be a great pleasure to me. And, if I\nknow my own poor heart, I shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable\ndegree; and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make\nfor the happiness of my late good lady's most beloved son.\n\nWell, said he, this conversation, Pamela, is gone farther than I\nintended it. You need not be afraid, at this rate, of trusting yourself\nwith me: but it is I that ought to be doubtful of myself, when I am with\nyou.--But before I say any thing farther on this subject, I will take\nmy proud heart to task; and, till then, let every thing be as if this\nconversation had never passed. Only, let me tell you, that the more\nconfidence you place in me, the more you'll oblige me: but your doubts\nwill only beget cause of doubts. And with this ambiguous saying, he\nsaluted me with a more formal manner, if I may so say, than before, and\nlent me his hand; and so we walked toward the house, side by side, he\nseeming very thoughtful and pensive, as if he had already repented him\nof his goodness.\n\nWhat shall I do, what steps take, if all this be designing--O the\nperplexities of these cruel doubtings!--To be sure, if he be false, as\nI may call it, I have gone too far, much too far!--I am ready, on the\napprehension of this, to bite my forward tongue (or rather to beat my\nmore forward heart, that dictated to that poor machine) for what I have\nsaid. But sure, at least, he must be sincere for the time!--He could not\nbe such a practised dissembler!--If he could, O how desperately wicked\nis the heart of man!--And where could he learn all these barbarous\narts?--If so, it must be native surely to the sex!--But, silent be my\nrash censurings; be hushed, ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind! for\nhave I not a father who is a man?--A man who knows no guile! who would\ndo no wrong!--who would not deceive or oppress, to gain a kingdom!--How\nthen can I think it is native to the sex? And I must also hope my good\nlady's son cannot be the worst of men!--If he is, hard the lot of the\nexcellent woman that bore him!--But much harder the hap of your poor\nPamela, who has fallen into such hands!--But yet I will trust in God,\nand hope the best: and so lay down my tired pen for this time.\n\n\nThursday morning.\n\nSomebody rapped at our chamber-door this morning, soon after it was\nlight: Mrs. Jewkes asked, who it was? My master said, Open the door,\nMrs. Jewkes! O, said I, for God's sake, Mrs. Jewkes, don't! Indeed, said\nshe, but I must. Then, said I, and clung about her, let me slip on my\nclothes first. But he rapped again, and she broke from me; and I was\nfrightened out of my wits, and folded myself in the bed-clothes. He\nentered, and said, What, Pamela, so fearful, after what passed yesterday\nbetween us! O, sir, sir, said I, I fear my prayers have wanted their\nwished effect! Pray, good sir, consider--He sat down on the bed-side,\nand interrupted me; No need of your foolish fears; I shall say but a\nword or two, and go away.\n\nAfter you went up stairs, said he, I had an invitation to a ball, which\nis to be this night at Stamford, on occasion of a wedding; and I am\ngoing to call on Sir Simon, and his lady and daughters; for the bride is\na relation of theirs: so I shall not be at home till Saturday. I come,\ntherefore, to caution you, Mrs. Jewkes, before Pamela, (that she may\nnot wonder at being closer confined, than for these three or four days\npast,) that nobody sees her, nor delivers any letter to her, in that\nspace; for a person has been seen lurking about, and inquiring after\nher, and I have been well informed, that either Mrs. Jervis, or Mr.\nLongman, has written a letter, with a design of having it conveyed\nto her: And, said he, you must know, Pamela, that I have ordered Mr.\nLongman to give up his accounts, and have dismissed Jonathan and\nMrs. Jervis, since I have been here; for their behaviour has been\nintolerable; and they have made such a breach between my sister Davers\nand me, as we shall never, perhaps, make up. Now, Pamela, I shall take\nit kindly in you, if you will confine yourself to your chamber pretty\nmuch, for the time I am absent, and not give Mrs. Jewkes cause of\ntrouble or uneasiness; and the rather, as you know she acts by my\norders.\n\nAlas! sir, said I, I fear all these good people have suffered for my\nsake!--Why, said he, I believe so too; and there was never a girl of\nyour innocence, that set a large family in such an uproar, surely.--But\nlet that pass. You know both of you my mind, and, in part, the reason of\nit. I shall only say, that I have had such a letter from my sister, as\nI could not have expected; and, Pamela, said he, neither you nor I have\nreason to thank her, as you shall know, perhaps at my return.--I go in\nmy coach, Mrs. Jewkes, because I take Lady Darnford, and Mrs. Peters's\nniece, and one of Lady Darnford's daughters, along with me; and Sir\nSimon and his other daughter go in his chariot: so let all the gates be\nfastened; and don't take any airing in either of the chariots, nor let\nany body go to the gate, without you, Mrs. Jewkes. I'll be sure, said\nshe, to obey your honour.\n\nI will give Mrs. Jewkes no trouble, sir, said I; and will keep pretty\nmuch in my chamber, and not stir so much as into the garden without her;\nto shew you I will obey in every thing I can. But I begin to fear--Ay,\nsaid he, more plots and contrivances, don't you?--But I'll assure you,\nyou never had less reason; and I tell you the truth; for I am really\ngoing to Stamford this time; and upon the occasion I tell you. And so,\nPamela, give me your hand, and one kiss; and then I am gone.\n\nI durst not refuse, and said, God bless you, sir, wherever you go!--But\nI am sorry for what you tell me about your servants!\n\nHe and Mrs. Jewkes had a little talk without the door; and I heard her\nsay, You may depend, sir, upon my care and vigilance.\n\nHe went in his coach, as he said he should, and very richly dressed,\nwhich looks as if what he said was likely: but really I have been used\nto so many tricks, and plots, and surprises, that I know not what to\nthink. But I mourn for poor Mrs. Jervis.--So here is Parson Williams;\nhere's poor naughty John; here is good Mrs. Jervis, and Mr. Longman, and\nMr. Jonathan, turned away for me!--Mr. Longman is rich, indeed, and so\nneed the less matter it; but I know it will grieve him: and for poor Mr.\nJonathan, I am sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart. Alas\nfor me! what mischiefs am I the occasion of!--Or, rather, my master,\nwhose actions towards me have made so many of my kind friends forfeit\nhis favour, for my sake!\n\nI am very sad about these things: If he really loved me, methinks he\nshould not be so angry, that his servants loved me too.--I know not what\nto think!\n\n\nFriday night.\n\nI have removed my papers from under the rose-bush; for I saw the\ngardener begin to dig near that spot; and I was afraid he would find\nthem.\n\nMrs. Jewkes and I were looking yesterday through the iron gate that\nfronts the elms; and a gipsy-like body made up to us, and said; If,\nmadam, you will give me some broken victuals, I will tell you both your\nfortunes. I said, Let us hear our fortunes, Mrs. Jewkes. She said, I\ndon't like these sort of people; but we will hear what she'll say to\nus, however. I shan't fetch you any victuals, woman; but I will give you\nsome pence, said she.\n\nBut Nan coming out, she said, Fetch some bread, and some of the cold\nmeat, and you shall have your fortune told, Nan.\n\nThis, you'll think, like some of my other matters, a very trifling thing\nto write about. But mark the discovery of a dreadful plot, which I have\nmade by it. O, bless me! What can I think of this naughty, this very\nnaughty gentleman!--Now will I hate him most heartily. Thus it was:--\n\nMrs. Jewkes had no suspicion of the woman, the iron gate being locked,\nand she on the outside, and we on the inside; and so put her hand\nthrough. She said, muttering over a parcel of cramp words; Why, madam,\nyou will marry soon, I can tell you. At that she seemed pleased, and\nsaid, I am glad to hear that; and shook her fat sides with laughing.\nThe woman looked most earnestly at me, all the time, and as if she\nhad meaning. Then it came into my head, from my master's caution, that\npossibly this woman might be employed to try to get a letter into my\nhands; and I was resolved to watch all her motions. So Mrs. Jewkes said,\nWhat sort of a man shall I have, pray?--Why, said she, a man younger\nthan yourself; and a very good husband he'll prove.--I am glad of that,\nsaid she; and laughed again. Come, madam, let us hear your fortune.\n\nThe woman came to me, and took my hand. O! said she, I cannot tell your\nfortune: your hand is so white and fine, I cannot see the lines: but,\nsaid she, and, stooping, pulled up a little tuft of grass, I have a way\nfor that; and so rubbed my hand with the mould part of the tuft: Now,\nsaid she, I can see the lines.\n\nMrs. Jewkes was very watchful of all her ways, and took the tuft, and\nlooked upon it, lest any thing should be in that. And then the woman\nsaid, Here is the line of Jupiter crossing the line of life; and\nMars--Odd! my pretty mistress, said she, you had best take care of\nyourself; for you are hard beset, I'll assure you. You will never be\nmarried, I can see; and will die of your first child. Out upon thee,\nwoman! said I, better thou hadst never come here.\n\nSaid Mrs. Jewkes, whispering, I don't like this: it looks like a cheat:\nPray, Mrs. Pamela, go in, this moment. So I will, said I; for I have\nenough of fortune-telling. And in I went.\n\nThe woman wanted sadly to tell me more, which made Mrs. Jewkes threaten\nher, suspecting still the more; and away the woman went, having told Nan\nher fortune, and she would be drowned.\n\nThis thing ran strongly in all our heads; and we went, an hour after, to\nsee if the woman was lurking about, and took Mr. Colbrand for our guard.\nLooking through the iron gate, he spied a man sauntering about the\nmiddle of the walk; which filled Mrs. Jewkes with still more suspicions;\nand she said, Mr. Colbrand, you and I will walk towards this fellow, and\nsee what he saunters there for: And, Nan, do you and madam stay at the\ngate.\n\nSo they opened the iron gate and walked down towards the man; and\nguessing the woman, if employed, must mean something by the tuft of\ngrass, I cast my eye that way, whence she pulled it, and saw more grass\nseemingly pulled up: then I doubted not something was there for me; and\nI walked to it, and standing over it, said to Nan, That's a pretty sort\nof wild flower, that grows yonder, near the elm, the fifth from us on\nthe left; pray pull it for me. Said she, It is a common weed. Well, said\nI, but pull it for me; there are sometimes beautiful colours in a weed.\n\nWhile she went on, I stooped, and pulled up a good handful of the grass,\nand in it a bit of paper, which I put instantly in my bosom, and dropt\nthe grass: and my heart went pit-a-pat at the odd adventure. Said I,\nLet's go in, Mrs. Anne. No, said she, we must stay till Mrs. Jewkes\ncomes.\n\nI was all impatience to read this paper: and when Colbrand and she\nreturned, I went in. Said she, Certainly there is some reason for my\nmaster's caution: I can make nothing of this sauntering fellow; but,\nto be sure, there was some roguery in the gipsy. Well, said I, if there\nwas, she lost her aim, you see! Ay, very true, said she; but that was\nowing to my watchfulness; and you was very good to go away, when I spoke\nto you.\n\nI hastened up stairs to my closet, and found the billet to contain, in a\nhand that seemed disguised, and bad spelling, the following words:\n\n\n'Twenty contrivances have been thought of to let you know your danger:\nbut all have proved in vain. Your friends hope it is not yet too late\nto give you this caution, if it reaches your hands. The 'squire is\nabsolutely determined to ruin you; and, because he despairs of any other\nway, he will pretend great love and kindness to you, and that he will\nmarry you. You may expect a parson, for this purpose, in a few days; but\nit is a sly artful fellow, of a broken attorney, that he has hired to\npersonate a minister. The man has a broad face, pitted much with the\nsmall-pox, and is a very great companion. So take care of yourself.\nDoubt not this advice. Perhaps you'll have had but too much reason\nalready to confirm you in the truth of it. From your zealous\nwell-wisher, 'SOMEBODY.'\n\n\nNow, my dear father and mother, what shall we say of this truly\ndiabolical master! O, how shall I find words to paint my griefs, and his\ndeceit! I have as good as confessed I love him; but, indeed, it was on\nsupposing him good.--This, however, has given him too much advantage.\nBut now I will break this wicked forward heart of mine, if it will not\nbe taught to hate him! O, what a black dismal heart must he have! So\nhere is a plot to ruin me, and by my own consent to!--No wonder he did\nnot improve his wicked opportunities, (which I thought owing to remorse\nfor his sin, and compassion for me,) when he had such a project as\nthis in reserve!--Here should I have been deluded with the hopes of a\nhappiness that my highest ambition could have had aspired to!--But\nhow dreadful must have been my lot, when I had found myself an undone\ncreature, and a guilty harlot, instead of a lawful wife! Oh! this is\nindeed too much, too much, for your poor Pamela to support! This is the\nworse, as I hoped all the worst was over; and that I had the pleasure of\nbeholding a reclaimed man, and not an abandoned libertine. What now must\nyour poor daughter do? Now all her hopes are dashed! And if this fails\nhim, then comes, to be sure, my forced disgrace! for this shews he will\nnever leave till he has ruined me--O, the wretched, wretched Pamela!\n\n\nSaturday noon, one o'clock.\n\nMy master is come home; and, to be sure, has been where he said. So once\nhe has told truth; and this matter seems to be gone off without a plot:\nNo doubt he depends upon his sham wicked marriage! He has brought a\ngentleman with him to dinner; and so I have not seen him yet.\n\n\nTwo o'clock.\n\nI am very sorrowful, and still have greater reason; for, just now, as I\nwas in my closet, opening the parcel I had hid under the rose-bush,\nto see if it was damaged by lying so long, Mrs. Jewkes came upon me by\nsurprise, and laid her hands upon it; for she had been looking through\nthe key-hole, it seems.\n\nI know not what I shall do! For now he will see all my private thoughts\nof him, and all my secrets, as I may say. What a careless creature I\nam!--To be sure I deserve to be punished.\n\nYou know I had the good luck, by Mr. Williams's means, to send you all\nmy papers down to Sunday night, the 17th day of my imprisonment. But\nnow these papers contain all my matters from that time, to Wednesday the\n27th day of my distress: And which, as you may now, perhaps, never see,\nI will briefly mention the contents to you.\n\nIn these papers, then, are included, 'An account of Mrs. Jewkes's arts\nto draw me in to approve of Mr. Williams's proposal for marriage; and my\nrefusing to do so; and desiring you not to encourage his suit to me. Mr.\nWilliams's being wickedly robbed, and a visit of hers to him; whereby\nshe discovered all his secrets. How I was inclined to get off, while she\nwas gone; but was ridiculously prevented by my foolish fears, etc. My\nhaving the key of the back-door. Mrs. Jewkes's writing to my master all\nthe secrets she had discovered of Mr. Williams, and her behaviour to me\nand him upon it. Continuance of my correspondence with Mr. Williams by\nthe tiles; begun in the parcel you had. My reproaches to him for his\nrevealing himself to Mrs. Jewkes; and his letter to me in answer,\nthreatening to expose my master, if he deceived him; mentioning in it\nJohn Arnold's correspondence with him; and a letter which John sent, and\nwas intercepted, as it seems. Of the correspondence being carried on by\na friend of his at Gainsborough. Of the horse he was to provide for me,\nand one for himself. Of what Mr. Williams had owned to Mrs. Jewkes; and\nof my discouraging his proposals. Then it contained a pressing letter of\nmine to him, urging my escape before my master came; with his half-angry\nanswer to me. Your good letter to me, my dear father, sent to me by\nMr. Williams's conveyance; in which you would have me encourage Mr.\nWilliams, but leave it to me; and in which, fortunately enough, you take\nnotice of my being uninclined to marry.--My earnest desire to be\nwith you. The substance of my answer to Mr. Williams, expressing more\npatience, etc. A dreadful letter of my master to Mrs. Jewkes; which, by\nmistake, was directed to me; and one to me, directed by like mistake\nto her; and very free reflections of mine upon both. The concern I\nexpressed for Mr. Williams's being taken in, deceived, and ruined.\nAn account of Mrs. Jewkes's glorying in her wicked fidelity. A sad\ndescription I gave of Monsieur Colbrand, a person he sent down to assist\nMrs. Jewkes in watching me. How Mr. Williams was arrested, and thrown\ninto gaol; and the concern I expressed upon it; and my free reflections\non my master for it. A projected contrivance of mine, to get away out\nof the window, and by the back-door; and throwing by petticoat and\nhandkerchief into the pond to amuse them, while I got off: An attempt\nthat had like to have ended very dreadfully for me! My further concern\nfor Mr. Williams's ruin, on my account: And, lastly, my over-hearing\nMrs. Jewkes brag of her contrivance to rob Mr. Williams, in order to get\nat my papers; which, however, he preserved, and sent safe to you.'\n\nThese, down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape, are,\nto the best of my remembrance, the contents of the papers, which this\nmerciless woman seized: For, how badly I came off, and what followed, I\nstill have safe, as I hope, sewed in my under-coat, about my hips.\n\nIn vain were all my prayers and tears to her, to get her not to shew\nthem to my master. For she said, It had now come out, why I affected to\nbe so much alone; and why I was always writing. And she thought herself\nhappy, she said, she had found these; for often and often had she\nsearched every place she could think of, for writings, to no purpose\nbefore. And she hoped, she said, there was nothing in them by what any\nbody might see; for, said she, you know you are all innocence!--Insolent\ncreature! said I, I am sure you are all guilt!--And so you must do your\nworst; for now I can't help myself, and I see there is no mercy to be\nexpected from you.\n\nJust now, my master being come up, she went to him upon the stairs, and\ngave him my papers. There, sir, said she; you always said Mrs. Pamela\nwas a great writer; but I never could get at any thing of hers before.\nHe took them; and, without coming to me, went down to the parlour again.\nAnd what with the gipsy affair, and what with this, I could not think\nof going down to dinner; and she told him that too; and so I suppose I\nshall have him up stairs, as soon as his company is gone.\n\n\nSaturday, six o'clock.\n\nMy master came up, and, in a pleasanter manner than I expected,\nsaid, So, Pamela, we have seized, it seems, your treasonable papers?\nTreasonable! said I, very sullenly. Ay, said he, I suppose so; for you\nare a great plotter: but I have not read them yet.\n\nThen, sir, said I, very gravely, it will be truly honourable in you not\nto read them; but to give them to me again. To whom, says he, are they\nwritten?--To my father, sir; but I suppose you see to whom.--Indeed,\nreturned he, I have not read three lines yet. Then, pray, sir, don't\nread them; but give them to me again. That I will not, said he, till\nI have read them. Sir, said I, you served me not well in the letters\nI used to write formerly: I think it was not worthy your character\nto contrive to get them in your hands, by that false John Arnold! for\nshould such a gentleman as you mind what your poor servant writes?--Yes,\nsaid he, by all means, mind what such a servant as my Pamela writes.\n\nYour Pamela! thought I. Then the sham marriage came into my head; and\nindeed it has not been out of it, since the gipsy affair.--But, said\nhe, have you any thing in these papers you would not have me see? To\nbe sure, sir, said I, there is; for what one writes to one's father and\nmother, is not for every body to see. Nor, said he, am I every body.\n\nThose letters, added he, that I did see by John's means, were not to\nyour disadvantage, I'll assure you; for they gave me a very high opinion\nof your wit and innocence: And if I had not loved you, do you think I\nwould have troubled myself about your letters?\n\nAlas! sir, said I, great pride to me that! For they gave you such an\nopinion of my innocence, that you was resolved to ruin me. And what\nadvantage have they brought me!--Who have been made a prisoner, and used\nas I have been between you and your housekeeper.\n\nWhy, Pamela, said he, a little seriously, why this behaviour, for my\ngoodness to you in the garden?--This is not of a piece with your conduct\nand softness there, that quite charmed me in your favour: And you must\nnot give me cause to think that you will be the more insolent, as\nyou find me kinder. Ah! sir, said I, you know best your own heart and\ndesigns! But I fear I was too open-hearted then; and that you still\nkeep your resolution to undo me, and have only changed the form of your\nproceedings.\n\nWhen I tell you once again, said he, a little sternly, that you cannot\noblige me more, than by placing some confidence in me, I will let you\nknow, that these foolish and perverse doubts are the worst things you\ncan be guilty of. But, said he, I shall possibly account for the cause\nof them, in these papers of yours; for I doubt not you have been sincere\nto your father and mother, though you begin to make me suspect you: For\nI tell you, perverse girl, that it is impossible you should be thus cold\nand insensible, after what has passed in the garden, if you were not\nprepossessed in some other person's favour: And let me add, that if I\nfind it so, it shall be attended with such effects, as will make every\nvein in your heart bleed.\n\nHe was going away in wrath; and I said, One word, good sir, one\nword before you read them, since you will read them: Pray make\nallowances--for all the harsh reflections that you will find in them,\non your own conduct to me: And remember only, that they were not written\nfor your sight; and were penned by a poor creature hardly used, and who\nwas in constant apprehension of receiving from you the worst treatment\nthat you could inflict upon her.\n\nIf that be all, said he, and there be nothing of another nature, that\nI cannot forgive, you have no cause for uneasiness; for I had as many\ninstances of your saucy reflections upon me in your former letters, as\nthere were lines; and yet, you see, I have never upbraided you on that\nscore; though, perhaps, I wished you had been more sparing of your\nepithets, and your freedoms of that sort.\n\nWell, sir, said I, since you will, you must read them; and I think I\nhave no reason to be afraid of being found insincere, or having, in any\nrespect, told you a falsehood; because, though I don't remember all\nI wrote, yet I know I wrote my heart; and that is not deceitful. And\nremember, sir, another thing, that I always declared I thought myself\nright to endeavour to make my escape from this forced and illegal\nrestraint; and so you must not be angry that I would have done so, if I\ncould.\n\nI'll judge you, never fear, said he, as favourably as you deserve; for\nyou have too powerful a pleader within me. And so went down stairs.\n\nAbout nine o'clock he sent for me down into the parlour. I went a little\nfearfully; and he held the paper in his hand, and said, Now, Pamela,\nyou come upon your trial. Said I, I hope I have a just judge to hear my\ncause. Ay, said he, and you may hope for a merciful one too, or else I\nknow not what will become of you.\n\nI expect, continued he, that you will answer me directly, and plainly,\nto every question I shall ask you.--In the first place, here are several\nlove-letters between you and Williams. Love-letters! sir, said I.--Well,\ncall them what you will, said he, I don't entirely like them, I'll\nassure you, with all the allowances you desired me to make for you. Do\nyou find, sir, said I, that I encouraged his proposal, or do you not?\nWhy, said he, you discourage his address in appearance; but no otherwise\nthan all your cunning sex do to ours, to make us more eager in pursuing\nyou.\n\nWell, sir, said I, that is your comment; but it does not appear so in\nthe text. Smartly said! says he: Where a d---l gottest thou, at these\nyears, all this knowledge? And then thou hast a memory, as I see by your\npapers, that nothing escapes. Alas! sir, said I, what poor abilities I\nhave, serve only to make me more miserable!--I have no pleasure in my\nmemory, which impresses things upon me, that I could be glad never were,\nor everlastingly to forget.\n\nWell, said he, so much for that--But where are the accounts (since you\nhave kept so exact a journal of all that has befallen you) previous to\nthese here in my hand? My father has them, sir, said I.--By whose means?\nsaid he--By Mr. Williams's, said I. Well answered, said he. But cannot\nyou contrive to get me a sight of them? That would be pretty! said I. I\nwish I could have contrived to have kept those you have from your sight.\nSaid he, I must see them, Pamela, or I shall never be easy; for I must\nknow how this correspondence between you and Williams began: and if I\ncan see them, it shall be better for you, if they answer what these give\nme hope they will.\n\nI can tell you, sir, very faithfully, said I, what the beginning was;\nfor I was bold enough to be the beginner. That won't do, said he;\nfor though this may appear a punctilio to you, to me it is of high\nimportance. Sir, said I, if you please to let me go to my father, I will\nsend them to you by any messenger you shall send for them. Will you so?\nBut I dare say, if you will write for them, they will send them to you,\nwithout the trouble of such a journey to yourself: and I beg you will.\n\nI think, sir, said I, as you have seen all my former letters through\nJohn's baseness, and now these, through your faithful housekeeper's\nofficious watchfulness, you might see all the rest: But I hope you\nwill not desire it, till I can see how much my pleasing you in this\nparticular will be of use to myself.\n\nYou must trust to my honour for that. But tell me, Pamela, said the sly\ngentleman, since I have seen these, would you have voluntarily shewn me\nthose, had they been in your possession?\n\nI was not aware of this inference, and said, Yes, truly, sir, I think\nI should, if you commanded it. Well then, Pamela, said he, as I am sure\nyou have found means to continue your journal, I desire, till the former\npart can come, that you will shew me the succeeding.--O sir, sir, said\nI, have you caught me so?--But indeed you must excuse me there.\n\nWhy, said he, tell me truly, have you not continued your account till\nnow? Don't ask me, sir, said I. But I insist upon your answer, replied\nhe. Why then, sir, I will not tell an untruth; I have.--That's my good\ngirl! said he, I love sincerity at my heart.--In another, sir, said I,\nI presume you mean!--Well, said he, I'll allow you to be a little witty\nupon me; because it is in you, and you cannot help it: but you will\ngreatly oblige me, to shew me voluntarily what you have written. I long\nto see the particulars of your plot, and your disappointment, where your\npapers leave off: for you have so beautiful a manner, that it is partly\nthat, and partly my love for you, that has made me desirous of reading\nall you write; though a great deal of it is against myself; for which\nyou must expect to suffer a little: and as I have furnished you with the\nsubject, I have a title to see the fruits of your pen.--Besides, said\nhe, there is such a pretty air of romance, as you relate them, in your\nplots, and my plots, that I shall be better directed in what manner to\nwind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel.\n\nIf I was your equal, sir, said I, I should say this is a very provoking\nway of jeering at the misfortunes you have brought upon me.\n\nO, said he, the liberties you have taken with my character in your\nletters, sets us upon a par, at least in that respect. Sir, I could not\nhave taken those liberties, if you had not given me the cause: and the\ncause, sir, you know, is before the effect.\n\nTrue, Pamela, said he; you chop logic very prettily. What the deuse do\nwe men go to school for? If our wits were equal to women's, we might\nspare much time and pains in our education: for nature teaches your\nsex, what, in a long course of labour and study, ours can hardly attain\nto.--But, indeed, every lady is not a Pamela.\n\nYou delight to banter your poor servant, said I.\n\nNay, continued he, I believe I must assume to myself half the merit of\nyour wit, too; for the innocent exercises you have had for it, from me,\nhave certainly sharpened your invention.\n\nSir, said I, could I have been without those innocent exercises, as you\nare pleased to call them, I should have been glad to have been as dull\nas a beetle. But then, Pamela, said he, I should not have loved you so\nwell. But then, sir, I should have been safe, easy, and happy.--Ay, may\nbe so, and may be not; and the wife, too, of some clouterly plough-boy.\n\nBut then, sir, I should have been content and innocent; and that's\nbetter than being a princess, and not so. And may be not, said he; for\nif you had had that pretty face, some of us keen fox-hunters should have\nfound you out; and, in spite of your romantic notions, (which then, too,\nperhaps, would not have had so strong a place in your mind,) might have\nbeen more happy with the ploughman's wife, than I have been with my\nmother's Pamela. I hope, sir, said I, God would have given me more\ngrace.\n\nWell, but, resumed he, as to these writings of yours, that follow your\nfine plot, I must see them. Indeed, sir, you must not, if I can help\nit. Nothing, said he, pleases me better, than that, in all your arts,\nshifts, and stratagems, you have had a great regard to truth; and have,\nin all your little pieces of deceit, told very few wilful fibs. Now\nI expect you'll continue this laudable rule in your conversation with\nme.--Let me know then, where you have found supplies of pen, ink, and\npaper, when Mrs. Jewkes was so vigilant, and gave you but two sheets at\na time?--Tell me truth.\n\nWhy, sir, little did I think I should have such occasion for them; but,\nwhen I went away from your house, I begged some of each of good Mr.\nLongman, who gave me plenty. Yes, yes, said he, it must be good Mr.\nLongman! All your confederates are good, every one of them: but such of\nmy servants as have done their duty, and obeyed my orders, are painted\nout by you as black as devils! nay, so am I too, for that matter.\n\nSir, said I, I hope you won't be angry, but, saving yourself, do you\nthink they are painted worse than they deserve? or worse than the parts\nthey acted require?\n\nYou say, saving myself, Pamela; but is not that saying a mere\ncompliment to me, because I am present, and you are in my hands? Tell me\ntruly.--Good sir, excuse me; but I fancy I might ask you, Why you should\nthink so, if there was not a little bit of conscience that told you,\nthere was but too much reason for it?\n\nHe kissed me, and said, I must either do thus, or be angry with you; for\nyou are very saucy, Pamela.--But, with your bewitching chit-chat, and\npretty impertinence, I will not lose my question. Where did you hide\nyour paper, pens, and ink?\n\nSome, sir, in one place, some in another; that I might have some left,\nif others should be found.--That's a good girl! said he; I love you\nfor your sweet veracity. Now tell me where it is you hide your written\npapers, your saucy journal?--I must beg your excuse for that, sir, said\nI. But indeed, answered he, you will not have it: for I will know, and\nI will see them.--This is very hard, sir, said I; but I must say, you\nshall not, if I can help it.\n\nWe were standing most of this time; but he then sat down, and took me\nby both my hands, and said, Well said, my pretty Pamela, if you can help\nit! But I will not let you help it. Tell me, are they in your pocket?\nNo, sir, said I; my heart up at my mouth. Said he, I know you won't tell\na downright fib for the world: but for equivocation! no jesuit ever went\nbeyond you. Answer me then, Are they in neither of your pockets? No,\nsir, said I. Are they not, said he, about your stays? No, sir, replied\nI: But pray no more questions: for ask me ever so much, I will not tell\nyou.\n\nO, said he, I have a way for that. I can do as they do abroad, when the\ncriminals won't confess; torture them till they do.--But pray, sir, said\nI, is this fair, just, or honest? I am no criminal; and I won't confess.\n\nO, my girl! said he, many an innocent person has been put to the\ntorture. But let me know where they are, and you shall escape the\nquestion, as they call it abroad.\n\nSir, said I, the torture is not used in England, and I hope you won't\nbring it up. Admirably said! said the naughty gentleman.--But I can tell\nyou of as good a punishment. If a criminal won't plead with us, here\nin England, we press him to death, or till he does plead. And so now,\nPamela, that is a punishment shall certainly be yours, if you won't tell\nwithout.\n\nTears stood in my eyes, and I said, This, sir, is very cruel and\nbarbarous.--No matter, said he; it is but like your Lucifer, you know,\nin my shape! And, after I have done so many heinous things by you as\nyou think, you have no great reason to judge so hardly of this; or, at\nleast, it is but of a piece with the rest.\n\nBut, sir, said I, (dreadfully afraid he had some notion they were about\nme,) if you will be obeyed in this unreasonable manner, though it is sad\ntyranny, to be sure!--let me go up to them, and read them over again,\nand you shall see so far as to the end of the sad story that follows\nthose you have.\n\nI'll see them all, said he, down to this time, if you have written so\nfar:--Or, at least, till within this week.--Then let me go up to them,\nsaid I, and see what I have written, and to what day, to shew them\nto you; for you won't desire to see every thing. But I will, replied\nhe.--But say, Pamela, tell me truth: Are they above? I was much\naffrighted. He saw my confusion. Tell me truth, said he. Why, sir,\nanswered I, I have sometimes hid them under the dry mould in the garden;\nsometimes in one place, sometimes in another; and those you have in your\nhand, were several days under a rose-bush, in the garden. Artful slut!\nsaid he, What's this to my question?--Are they not about you?--If, said\nI, I must pluck them out of my hiding-place behind the wainscot, won't\nyou see me?--Still more and more artful! said he--Is this an answer to\nmy question?--I have searched every place above, and in your closet, for\nthem, and cannot find them; so I will know where they are. Now, said he,\nit is my opinion they are about you; and I never undressed a girl in my\nlife; but I will now begin to strip my pretty Pamela; and I hope I shall\nnot go far before I find them.\n\nI fell a crying, and said, I will not be used in this manner. Pray, sir,\nsaid I, (for he began to unpin my handkerchief,) consider! Pray sir,\ndo!--And pray, said he, do you consider. For I will see these papers.\nBut may be, said he, they are tied about your knees, with your garters,\nand stooped. Was ever any thing so vile and so wicked?--I fell on my\nknees, and said, What can I do? What can I do? If you'll let me go up\nI'll fetch them to you. Will you, said he, on your honour, let me see\nthem uncurtailed, and not offer to make them away; no not a single\npaper?--I will, sir.--On your honour? Yes, sir. And so he let me go up\nstairs, crying sadly for vexation to be so used. Sure nobody was ever so\nserved as I am!\n\nI went to my closet, and there I sat me down, and could not bear the\nthoughts of giving up my papers. Besides, I must all undress me, in a\nmanner, to untack them. So I writ thus:\n\n\n'SIR,\n\n'To expostulate with such an arbitrary gentleman, I know will signify\nnothing; and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have got\nover me. I have heart enough, sir, to do a deed that would make you\nregret using me thus; and I can hardly bear it, and what I am further\nto undergo. But a superior consideration withholds me; thank God, it\ndoes!--I will, however, keep my word, if you insist upon it when\nyou have read this; but, sir, let me beg of you to give me time till\nto-morrow morning, that I may just run them over, and see what I put\ninto your hands against me: and I will then give my papers to you,\nwithout the least alteration, or adding or diminishing: But I should\nbeg still to be excused, if you please: But if not, spare them to me but\ntill to-morrow morning: and this, so hardly am I used, shall be thought\na favour, which I shall be very thankful for.'\n\nI guessed it would not be long before I heard from him and he\naccordingly sent up Mrs. Jewkes for what I had promised. So I gave\nher this note to carry to him. And he sent word, that I must keep my\npromise, and he would give me till morning; but that I must bring them\nto him, without his asking again.\n\nSo I took off my under-coat, and with great trouble of mind, unsewed\nthem from it. And there is a vast quantity of it. I will just slightly\ntouch upon the subjects; because I may not, perhaps, get them again for\nyou to see.\n\nThey begin with an account of 'my attempting to get away out of the\nwindow first, and then throwing my petticoat and handkerchief into the\npond. How sadly I was disappointed, the lock of the back-door being\nchanged. How, in trying to climb over the door, I tumbled down, and was\npiteously bruised; the bricks giving way, and tumbling upon me. How,\nfinding I could not get off, and dreading the hard usage I should\nreceive, I was so wicked as to think of throwing myself into the water.\nMy sad reflections upon this matter. How Mrs. Jewkes used me upon this\noccasion, when she found me. How my master had like to have been drowned\nin hunting; and my concern for his danger, notwithstanding his usage\nof me. Mrs. Jewkes's wicked reports, to frighten me, that I was to be\nmarried to the ugly Swiss; who was to sell me on the wedding-day to\nmy master. Her vile way of talking to me, like a London prostitute. My\napprehensions of seeing preparations made for my master's coming. Her\ncauseless fears that I was trying to get away again, when I had no\nthoughts of it; and my bad usage upon it. My master's dreadful arrival;\nand his hard, very hard treatment of me; and Mrs. Jewkes's insulting\nof me. His jealousy of Mr. Williams and me. How Mrs. Jewkes vilely\ninstigated him to wickedness.' And down to here, I put into one parcel,\nhoping that would content him. But for fear it should not, I put into\nanother parcel the following; viz.\n\n'A copy of his proposals to me, of a great parcel of gold, and fine\nclothes and rings, and an estate of I can't tell what a year; and 50l. a\nyear for the life of both you, my dear parents, to be his mistress; with\nan insinuation, that, may be, he would marry me at the year's end: All\nsadly vile: With threatenings, if I did not comply, that he would ruin\nme, without allowing me any thing. A copy of my answer, refusing all,\nwith just abhorrence: But begging at last his goodness towards me, and\nmercy on me, in the most moving manner I could think of. An account\nof his angry behaviour, and Mrs. Jewkes's wicked advice hereupon. His\ntrying to get me to his chamber; and my refusal to go. A deal of stuff\nand chit-chat between me and the odious Mrs. Jewkes; in which she was\nvery wicked and very insulting. Two notes I wrote, as if to be carried\nto church, to pray for his reclaiming, and my safety; which Mrs.\nJewkes seized, and officiously shewed him. A confession of mine, that,\nnotwithstanding his bad usage, I could not hate him. My concern for Mr.\nWilliams. A horrid contrivance of my master's to ruin me; being in\nmy room, disguised in clothes of the maid's, who lay with me and Mrs.\nJewkes. How narrowly I escaped, (it makes my heart ache to think of it\nstill!) by falling into fits. Mrs. Jewkes's detestable part in this sad\naffair. How he seemed moved at my danger, and forbore his abominable\ndesigns; and assured me he had offered no indecency. How ill I was for\na day or two after; and how kind he seemed. How he made me forgive Mrs.\nJewkes. How, after this, and great kindness pretended, he made rude\noffers to me in the garden, which I escaped. How I resented them.' Then\nI had written, 'How kindly he behaved himself to me; and how he praised\nme, and gave me great hopes of his being good at last. Of the too tender\nimpression this made upon me; and how I began to be afraid of my own\nweakness and consideration for him, though he had used me so ill.\nHow sadly jealous he was of Mr. Williams; and how I, as justly could,\ncleared myself as to his doubts on that score. How, just when he had\nraised me up to the highest hope of his goodness, he dashed me sadly\nagain, and went off more coldly. My free reflections upon this trying\noccasion.'\n\nThis brought down matters from Thursday, the 20th day of my\nimprisonment, to Wednesday the 41st, and here I was resolved to end, let\nwhat would come; for only Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, remain to give\nan account of; and Thursday he set out to a ball at Stamford; and Friday\nwas the gipsy story; and this is Saturday, his return from Stamford. And\ntruly, I shall have but little heart to write, if he is to see all.\n\nSo these two parcels of papers I have got ready for him against\nto-morrow morning. To be sure I have always used him very freely in my\nwritings, and shewed him no mercy; but yet he must thank himself for\nit; for I have only writ truth; and I wish he had deserved a better\ncharacter at my hands, as well for his own sake as mine.--So, though I\ndon't know whether ever you'll see what I write, I must say, that I will\ngo to bed, with remembering you in my prayers, as I always do, and as I\nknow you do me: And so, my dear parents, good night.\n\n\nSunday morning.\n\nI remembered what he said, of not being obliged to ask again for my\npapers; and what I should be forced to do, and could not help, I thought\nI might as well do in such a manner as might shew I would not disoblige\non purpose: though I stomached this matter very heavily too. I had\ntherefore got in readiness my two parcels; and he, not going to church\nin the morning, bid Mrs. Jewkes tell me he was gone into the garden.\n\nI knew that was for me to go to him; and so I went: for how can I\nhelp being at his beck? which grieves me not a little, though he is my\nmaster, as I may say; for I am so wholly in his power, that it would\ndo me no good to incense him; and if I refused to obey him in little\nmatters, my refusal in greater would have the less weight. So I went\ndown to the garden; but as he walked in one walk, I took another, that I\nmight not seem too forward neither.\n\nHe soon 'spied me, and said, Do you expect to be courted to come to me?\nSir, said I, and crossed the walk to attend him, I did not know but I\nshould interrupt you in your meditations this good day.\n\nWas that the case, said he, truly, and from your heart? Why, sir, said\nI, I don't doubt but you have very good thoughts sometimes, though not\ntowards me. I wish, said he, I could avoid thinking so well of you as\nI do. But where are the papers?--I dare say you had them about you\nyesterday; for you say in those I have, that you will bury your writings\nin the garden, for fear you should be searched, if you did not escape.\nThis, added he, gave me a glorious pretence to search you; and I have\nbeen vexing myself all night, that I did not strip you garment by\ngarment, till I had found them. O fie, sir, said I; let me not be\nscared, with hearing that you had such a thought in earnest.\n\nWell, said he, I hope you have not now the papers to give me; for I had\nrather find them myself, I'll assure you.\n\nI did not like this way of talk at all; and thinking it best not to\ndwell upon it, said, Well, but, sir, you will excuse me, I hope, giving\nup my papers.\n\nDon't trifle with me, said he; Where are they?--I think I was very good\nto you last night, to humour you as I did. If you have either added\nor diminished, and have not strictly kept your promise, woe be to you!\nIndeed, sir, said I, I have neither added nor diminished. But there is\nthe parcel that goes on with my sad attempt to escape, and the terrible\nconsequences it had like to have been followed with. And it goes down to\nthe naughty articles you sent me. And as you know all that has happened\nsince, I hope these will satisfy you.\n\nHe was going to speak; but I said, to drive him from thinking of any\nmore, And I must beg you, sir, to read the matter favourably, if I have\nexceeded in any liberties of my pen.\n\nI think, said he, half-smiling, you may wonder at my patience, that I\ncan be so easy to read myself abused as I am by such a saucy slut.--Sir,\nsaid I, I have wondered you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff;\nand, for that very reason, I have thought it a very good, or a very bad\nsign. What, said he, is your good sign?--That it may have an effect upon\nyour temper, at last, in my favour, when you see me so sincere. Your\nbad sign? Why, that if you can read my reflections and observations upon\nyour treatment of me, with tranquillity, and not be moved, it is a sign\nof a very cruel and determined heart. Now, pray, sir, don't be angry at\nmy boldness in telling you so freely my thoughts. You may, perhaps, said\nhe, be least mistaken, when you think of your bad sign. God forbid! said\nI.\n\nSo I took out my papers; and said, Here, sir, they are. But if you\nplease to return them, without breaking the seal, it will be very\ngenerous: and I will take it for a great favour, and a good omen.\n\nHe broke the seal instantly, and opened them: So much for your omen!\nreplied he. I am sorry for it, said I, very seriously; and was walking\naway. Whither now? said he. I was going in, sir, that you might have\ntime to read them, if you thought fit. He put them into his pocket, and\nsaid, You have more than these. Yes, sir: but all they contain, you know\nas well as I.--But I don't know, said he, the light you put things in;\nand so give them me, if you have not a mind to be searched.\n\nSir, said I, I can't stay, if you won't forbear that ugly word.--Give\nme then no reason for it. Where are the other papers? Why, then, unkind\nsir, if it must be so, here they are. And so I gave him, out of\nmy pocket, the second parcel, sealed up, as the former, with this\nsuperscription; From the naughty articles, down, through sad attempts,\nto Thursday the 42d day of my imprisonment. This is last Thursday, is\nit? Yes, sir; but now you will see what I write, I will find some other\nway to employ my time: for how can I write with any face, what must be\nfor your perusal, and not for those I intended to read my melancholy\nstories?\n\nYes, said he, I would have you continue your penmanship by all means;\nand, I assure you, in the mind I am in, I will not ask you for any after\nthese; except any thing very extraordinary occurs. And I have another\nthing to tell you, added he, that if you send for those from your\nfather, and let me read them, I may, very probably, give them all back\nagain to you. And so I desire you will do it.\n\nThis a little encourages me to continue my scribbling; but, for fear of\nthe worst, I will, when they come to any bulk, contrive some way to\nhide them, if I can, that I may protest I have them not about me, which,\nbefore, I could not say of a truth; and that made him so resolutely bent\nto try to find them upon me; for which I might have suffered frightful\nindecencies.\n\nHe led me, then, to the side of the pond; and sitting down on the slope,\nmade me sit by him. Come, said he, this being the scene of part of your\nproject, and where you so artfully threw in some of your clothes, I will\njust look upon that part of your relation. Sir, said I, let me then walk\nabout, at a little distance; for I cannot bear the thought of it. Don't\ngo far, said he.\n\nWhen he came, as I suppose, to the place where I mentioned the bricks\nfalling upon me, he got up, and walked to the door, and looked upon\nthe broken part of the wall; for it had not been mended; and came back,\nreading on to himself, towards me; and took my hand, and put it under\nhis arm.\n\nWhy, this, said he, my girl, is a very moving tale. It was a very\ndesperate attempt, and, had you got out, you might have been in great\ndanger; for you had a very bad and lonely way; and I had taken such\nmeasures, that, let you have been where you would, I should have had\nyou.\n\nYou may see, sir, said I, what I ventured, rather than be ruined; and\nyou will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession,\nthat my honesty is dearer to me than my life. Romantic girl! said he,\nand read on.\n\nHe was very serious at my reflections, on what God had enabled me to\nescape. And when he came to my reasonings about throwing myself into the\nwater, he said, Walk gently before; and seemed so moved, that he turned\naway his face from me; and I blessed this good sign, and began not so\nmuch to repent at his seeing this mournful part of my story.\n\nHe put the papers in his pocket, when he had read my reflections, and\nthanks for escaping from myself; and said, taking me about the waist, O\nmy dear girl! you have touched me sensibly with your mournful relation,\nand your sweet reflections upon it. I should truly have been very\nmiserable had it taken effect. I see you have been used too roughly; and\nit is a mercy you stood proof in that fatal moment.\n\nThen he most kindly folded me in his arms: Let us, say I too, my Pamela,\nwalk from this accursed piece of water; for I shall not, with pleasure,\nlook upon it again, to think how near it was to have been fatal to my\nfair one. I thought, added he, of terrifying you to my will, since I\ncould not move you by love; and Mrs. Jewkes too well obeyed me, when the\nterrors of your return, after your disappointment, were so great, that\nyou had hardly courage to withstand them; but had like to have made so\nfatal a choice, to escape the treatment you apprehended.\n\nO sir, said I, I have reason, I am sure, to bless my dear parents,\nand my good lady, your mother, for giving me something of a religious\neducation; for, but for that, and God's grace, I should, more than upon\none occasion, have attempted, at least, a desperate act: and I the less\nwonder how poor creatures, who have not the fear of God before their\neyes, and give way to despondency, cast themselves into perdition.\n\nCome, kiss me, said he, and tell me you forgive me for pushing you into\nso much danger and distress. If my mind hold, and I can see those former\npapers of yours, and that these in my pocket give me no cause to altar\nmy opinion, I will endeavour to defy the world and the world's censures,\nand make my Pamela amends, if it be in the power of my whole life, for\nall the hardships I have made her undergo.\n\nAll this looked well; but you shall see how strangely it was all turned.\nFor this sham-marriage then came into my mind again; and I said, Your\npoor servant is far unworthy of this great honour; for what will it be\nbut to create envy to herself, and discredit to you? Therefore, sir,\npermit me to return to my poor parents, and that is all I have to ask.\n\nHe was in a fearful passion then. And is it thus, said he, in my fond\nconceding moments, that I am to be despised and answered?--Precise,\nperverse, unseasonable Pamela! begone from my sight! and know as well\nhow to behave in a hopeful prospect, as in a distressful state; and\nthen, and not till then, shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice.\n\nI was startled, and going to speak: but he stamped with his foot, and\nsaid, Begone! I tell you: I cannot bear this stupid romantic folly.\n\nOne word, said I; but one word, I beseech you, sir.\n\nHe turned from me in great wrath, and took down another alley, and so I\nwent, with a very heavy heart; and fear I was too unseasonable, just at\na time when he was so condescending: but if it was a piece of art of his\nside, as I apprehended, to introduce the sham-wedding, (and, to be sure,\nhe is very full of stratagem and art,) I think I was not so much to\nblame.\n\nSo I went up to my closet; and wrote thus far, while he walked about\ntill dinner was ready; and he is now sat down to it, as I hear by Mrs.\nJewkes, very sullen, thoughtful, and out of humour; and she asks, What\nI have done to him?--Now, again, I dread to see him!--When will my fears\nbe over?\n\n\nThree o'clock.\n\nWell, he continues exceeding wrath. He has ordered his travelling\nchariot to be got ready with all speed. What is to come next, I wonder!\n\nSure I did not say so much!--But see the lordliness of a high\ncondition!--A poor body must not put in a word, when they take it into\ntheir heads to be angry! What a fine time a person of an equal condition\nwould have of it, if she were even to marry such a one!--His poor dear\nmother spoiled him at first. Nobody must speak to him or contradict him,\nas I have heard, when he was a child; and so he has not been used to\nbe controlled, and cannot bear the least thing that crosses his violent\nwill. This is one of the blessings attending men of high condition! Much\ngood may do them with their pride of birth, and pride of fortune! say\nI:--All that it serves for, as far as I can see, is, to multiply their\ndisquiets, and every body's else that has to do with them.\n\nSo, so! where will this end?--Mrs. Jewkes has been with me from him,\nand she says, I must get out of the house this moment. Well, said I, but\nwhither am I to be carried next? Why, home, said she, to your father and\nmother. And can it be? said I; No, no, I doubt I shall not be so happy\nas that!--To be sure some bad design is on foot again! To be sure it\nis!--Sure, sure, said I, Mrs. Jewkes, he has not found out some other\nhousekeeper worse than you! She was very angry, you may well think. But\nI know she can't be made worse than she is.\n\nShe came up again. Are you ready? said she. Bless me, said I, you are\nvery hasty! I have heard of this not a quarter of an hour ago. But I\nshall be soon ready; for I have but little to take with me, and no kind\nfriends in this house to take leave of, to delay me. Yet, like a fool, I\ncan't help crying.--Pray, said I, just step down, and ask, if I may not\nhave my papers.\n\nSo, I am quite ready now, against she comes up with an answer; and so I\nwill put up these few writings in my bosom, that I have left.\n\nI don't know what to think--nor how to judge; but I shall never believe\nI am with you, till I am on my knees before you, begging both your\nblessings. Yet I am sorry he is so angry with me! I thought I did not\nsay so much!\n\nThere is, I see, the chariot drawn out, the horses too, the grim\nColbrand going to get on horseback. What will be the end of all this?\n\n\nMonday.\n\nWell, where this will end, I cannot say. But here I am, at a little poor\nvillage, almost such a one as yours! I shall learn the name of it by\nand by: and Robin assures me, he has orders to carry me to you, my dear\nfather and mother. O that he may say truth, and not deceive me again!\nBut having nothing else to do, and I am sure I shall not sleep a wink\nto-night, if I was to go to bed, I will write my time away, and take up\nmy story where I left off, on Sunday afternoon.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came up to me, with this answer about my papers: My master\nsays, he will not read them yet, lest he should be moved by any thing in\nthem to alter his resolution. But if he should think it worth while to\nread them, he will send them to you, afterwards, to your father's. But,\nsaid she, here are your guineas that I borrowed: for all is over now\nwith you, I find.\n\nShe saw me cry, and said, Do you repent?--Of what? said I.--Nay, I can't\ntell, replied she; but, to be sure, he has had a taste of your satirical\nflings, or he would not be so angry. O! continued she, and held up her\nhand, thou hast a spirit!--But I hope it will now be brought down.--I\nhope so too, said I.\n\nWell, added I, I am ready. She lifted up the window, and said, I'll call\nRobin to take your portmanteau: Bag and baggage! proceeded she, I'm\nglad you're going. I have no words, said I, to throw away upon you, Mrs.\nJewkes; but, making her a very low courtesy, I most heartily thank you\nfor all your virtuous civilities to me. And so adieu; for I'll have no\nportmanteau, I'll assure you, nor any thing but these few things that\nI brought with me in my handkerchief, besides what I have on. For I had\nall this time worn my own bought clothes, though my master would have\nhad it otherwise often: but I had put up paper, ink, and pens, however.\n\nSo down I went, and as I passed by the parlour, she stepped in, and\nsaid, Sir, you have nothing to say to the girl before she goes? I heard\nhim reply, though I did not see him, Who bid you say, the girl, Mrs.\nJewkes, in that manner? She has offended only me.\n\nI beg your honour's pardon, said the wretch; but if I was your honour,\nshe should not, for all the trouble she has cost you, go away scot-free.\nNo more of this, as I told you before, said he: What! when I have such\nproof, that her virtue is all her pride, shall I rob her of that?--No,\nadded he, let her go, perverse and foolish as she is; but she deserves\nto go honest, and she shall go so!\n\nI was so transported with this unexpected goodness, that I opened the\ndoor before I knew what I did; and said, falling on my knees at the\ndoor, with my hands folded, and lifted up, O thank you, thank your\nhonour, a million of times!--May God bless you for this instance of your\ngoodness to me! I will pray for you as long as I live, and so shall my\ndear father and mother. And, Mrs. Jewkes, said I, I will pray for you\ntoo, poor wicked wretch that you are!\n\nHe turned from me, and went into his closet, and shut the door. He need\nnot have done so; for I would not have gone nearer to him!\n\nSurely I did not say so much, to incur all this displeasure.\n\nI think I was loath to leave the house. Can you believe it?--What could\nbe the matter with me, I wonder?--I felt something so strange, and\nmy heart was so lumpish!--I wonder what ailed me!--But this was so\nunexpected!--I believe that was all!--Yet I am very strange still.\nSurely, surely, I cannot be like the old murmuring Israelites, to long\nafter the onions and garlick of Egypt, when they had suffered there such\nheavy bondage?--I'll take thee, O lumpish, contradictory, ungovernable\nheart! to severe task, for this thy strange impulse, when I get to my\ndear father's and mother's; and if I find any thing in thee that should\nnot be, depend upon it thou shalt be humbled, if strict abstinence,\nprayer, and mortification, will do it!\n\nBut yet, after all, this last goodness of his has touched me too\nsensibly. I wish I had not heard it, almost; and yet, methinks, I am\nglad I did; for I should rejoice to think the best of him, for his own\nsake.\n\nWell, and so I went out to the chariot, the same that brought me down.\nSo, Mr. Robert, said I, here I am again! a poor sporting-piece for the\ngreat! a mere tennis-ball of fortune! You have your orders, I hope. Yes,\nmadam, said he. Pray, now, said I, don't madam me, nor stand with your\nhat off to such a one as I. Had not my master, said he, ordered me not\nto be wanting in respect to you, I would have shewn you all I could.\nWell, said I, with my heart full, that's very kind, Mr. Robert.\n\nMr. Colbrand, mounted on horseback, with pistols before him, came up to\nme, as soon as I got in, with his hat off too. What, monsieur! said I,\nare you to go with me?--Part of the way, he said, to see you safe. I\nhope that's kind too, in you, Mr. Colbrand, said I.\n\nI had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now, nor to take leave of; and\nso I resigned myself to my contemplations, with this strange wayward\nheart of mine, that I never found so ungovernable and awkward before.\n\nSo away drove the chariot!--And when I had got out of the elm-walk, and\ninto the great road, I could hardly think but I was in a dream all the\ntime. A few hours before, in my master's arms almost, with twenty kind\nthings said to me, and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had\nbrought upon me; and only by one rash half-word exasperated against\nme, and turned out of doors, at an hour's warning; and all his kindness\nchanged to hate! And I now, from three o'clock to five, several miles\noff! But if I am going to you, all will be well again, I hope.\n\nLack-a-day, what strange creatures are men! gentlemen, I should say,\nrather! For, my dear deserving good mother, though poverty be both your\nlots, has had better hap, and you are, and have always been, blest in\none another!--Yet this pleases me too; he was so good, he would not let\nMrs. Jewkes speak ill of me, and scorned to take her odious unwomanly\nadvice. O, what a black heart has this poor wretch! So I need not rail\nagainst men so much; for my master, bad as I have thought him, is not\nhalf so bad as this woman.--To be sure she must be an atheist!--Do you\nthink she is not?\n\nWe could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse,\nrather than inn; for it began to be dark, and Robin did not make so much\nhaste as he might have done; and he was forced to make hard shift for\nhis horses.\n\nMr. Colbrand, and Robert too, are very civil. I see he has got my\nportmanteau lashed behind the coach. I did not desire it; but I shall\nnot come quite empty.\n\nA thorough riddance of me, I see!--Bag and baggage! as Mrs. Jewkes says.\nWell, my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel, if\nit was to be well told.\n\nMr. Robert came up to me, just now, and begged me to eat something: I\nthanked him; but said, I could not eat. I bid him ask Mr. Colbrand to\nwalk up; and he came; but neither of them would sit; nor put their hats\non. What mockado is this, to such a poor soul as I! I asked them, if\nthey were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with\nme? If not, I would not desire it.--They both said, Robin was ordered\nto carry me to my father's; and Mr. Colbrand was to leave me within ten\nmiles, and then strike off for the other house, and wait till my master\narrived there. They both spoke so solemnly, that I could not but believe\nthem.\n\nBut when Robin went down, the other said, he had a letter to give me\nnext day at noon, when we baited, as we were to do, at Mrs. Jewkes's\nrelation's.--May I not, said I, beg the favour to see it to-night? He\nseemed so loath to deny me, that I have hopes I shall prevail on him by\nand by.\n\nWell, my dear father and mother, I have got the letter, on great\npromises of secrecy, and making no use of it. I will try if I can open\nit without breaking the seal, and will take a copy of it by and by; for\nRobin is in and out: there being hardly any room in this little house\nfor one to be long alone. Well, this is the letter:\n\n\n'When these lines are delivered to you, you will be far on your way to\nyour father and mother, where you have so long desired to be: and, I\nhope, I shall forbear thinking of you with the least shadow of that\nfondness my foolish heart had entertained for you: I bear you, however,\nno ill will; but the end of my detaining you being over, I would not\nthat you should tarry with me an hour more than needed, after the\nungenerous preference you gave, at a time that I was inclined to pass\nover all other considerations, for an honourable address to you; for\nwell I found the tables entirely turned upon me, and that I was in\nfar more danger from you, than you were from me; for I was just upon\nresolving to defy all the censures of the world, and to make you my\nwife.\n\n'I will acknowledge another truth: That, had I not parted with you as I\ndid, but permitted you to stay till I had read your journal, reflecting,\nas I doubt not I shall find it, and till I had heard your bewitching\npleas in your own behalf, I feared I could not trust myself with my\nown resolution. And this is the reason, I frankly own, that I have\ndetermined not to see you, nor hear you speak; for well I know my\nweakness in your favour.\n\n'But I will get the better of this fond folly: Nay, I hope I have\nalready done it, since it was likely to cost me so dear. And I write\nthis to tell you, that I wish you well with all my heart, though you\nhave spread such mischief through my family.--And yet I cannot but\nsay that I could wish you would not think of marrying in haste; and,\nparticularly, that you would not have this cursed Williams.--But what\nis all this to me now?--Only, my weakness makes me say, That as I had\nalready looked upon you as mine, and you have so soon got rid of your\nfirst husband; so you will not refuse, to my memory, the decency that\nevery common person observes, to pay a twelvemonth's compliment, though\nbut a mere compliment, to my ashes.\n\n'Your papers shall be faithfully returned you; and I have paid so dear\nfor my curiosity in the affection they have rivetted upon me for you,\nthat you would look upon yourself amply revenged if you knew what they\nhave cost me.\n\n'I thought of writing only a few lines; but I have run into length. I\nwill now try to recollect my scattered thoughts, and resume my reason;\nand shall find trouble enough to replace my affairs, and my own family,\nand to supply the chasms you have made in it: For, let me tell you,\nthough I can forgive you, I never can my sister, nor my domestics; for\nmy vengeance must be wreaked somewhere.\n\n'I doubt not your prudence in forbearing to expose me any more than is\nnecessary for your own justification; and for that I will suffer myself\nto be accused by you, and will also accuse myself, if it be needful. For\nI am, and will ever be, 'Your affectionate well-wisher.'\n\n\nThis letter, when I expected some new plot, has affected me more than\nany thing of that sort could have done. For here is plainly his great\nvalue for me confessed, and his rigorous behaviour accounted for in such\na manner, as tortures me much. And all this wicked gipsy story is, as it\nseems, a forgery upon us both, and has quite ruined me: For, O my dear\nparents, forgive me! but I found, to my grief, before, that my heart\nwas too partial in his favour; but now with so much openness, so much\naffection; nay, so much honour too, (which was all I had before doubted,\nand kept me on the reserve,) I am quite overcome. This was a happiness,\nhowever, I had no reason to expect. But, to be sure, I must own to\nyou, that I shall never be able to think of any body in the world\nbut him.--Presumption! you will say; and so it is: But love is not a\nvoluntary thing: Love, did I say?--But come, I hope not:--At least it is\nnot, I hope, gone so far as to make me very uneasy: For I know not how\nit came, nor when it began; but crept, crept it has, like a thief, upon\nme; and before I knew what was the matter, it looked like love.\n\nI wish, since it is too late, and my lot determined, that I had not had\nthis letter, nor heard him take my part to that vile woman; for then I\nshould have blessed myself in having escaped so happily his designing\narts upon my virtue: but now my poor mind is all topsy-turvied, and I\nhave made an escape to be more a prisoner.\n\nBut I hope, since thus it is, that all will be for the best; and I\nshall, with your prudent advice, and pious prayers, be able to overcome\nthis weakness.--But, to be sure, my dear sir, I will keep a longer time\nthan a twelvemonth, as a true widow, for a compliment, and more than a\ncompliment, to your ashes! O the dear word!--How kind, how moving,\nhow affectionate is the word! O why was I not a duchess, to shew my\ngratitude for it! But must labour under the weight of an obligation,\neven had this happiness befallen me, that would have pressed me to\ndeath, and which I never could return by a whole life of faithful love,\nand cheerful obedience.\n\nO forgive your poor daughter!--I am sorry to find this trial so sore\nupon me; and that all the weakness of my weak sex, and tender years, who\nnever before knew what it was to be so touched, is come upon me, and\ntoo mighty to be withstood by me.--But time, prayer, and resignation to\nGod's will, and the benefits of your good lessons, and examples, I hope,\nwill enable me to get over this so heavy a trial.\n\nO my treacherous, treacherous heart! to serve me thus! and give no\nnotice to me of the mischiefs thou wast about to bring upon me!--But\nthus foolishly to give thyself up to the proud invader, without ever\nconsulting thy poor mistress in the least! But thy punishment will\nbe the first and the greatest; and well deservest thou to smart, O\nperfidious traitor! for giving up so weakly thy whole self, before a\nsummons came; and to one, too, who had used me so hardly; and when,\nlikewise, thou hadst so well maintained thy post against the most\nviolent and avowed, and, therefore, as I thought, more dangerous\nattacks!\n\nAfter all, I must either not shew you this my weakness, or tear it out\nof my writing. Memorandum: to consider of this, when I get home.\n\n\nMonday morning, eleven o'clock.\n\nWe are just come in here, to the inn kept by Mrs. Jewkes's relation. The\nfirst compliment I had, was in a very impudent manner, How I liked the\n'squire?--I could not help saying, Bold, forward woman! Is it for you,\nwho keep an inn, to treat passengers at this rate? She was but in jest,\nshe said, and asked pardon: And she came, and begged excuse again, very\nsubmissively, after Robin and Mr. Colbrand had talked to her a little.\n\nThe latter here, in great form, gave me, before Robin, the letter which\nI had given him back for that purpose. And I retired, as if to read\nit; and so I did; for I think I can't read it too often; though, for\nmy peace of mind's sake, I might better try to forget it. I am sorry,\nmethinks, I cannot bring you back a sound heart; but, indeed, it is\nan honest one, as to any body but me; for it has deceived nobody else:\nWicked thing that it is!\n\nMore and more surprising things still----\n\nJust as I had sat down, to try to eat a bit of victuals, to get ready\nto pursue my journey, came in Mr. Colbrand in a mighty hurry. O madam!\nmadam! said he, here be de groom from de 'Squire B----, all over in a\nlather, man and horse! O how my heart went pit-a-pat! What now, thought\nI, is to come next! He went out, and presently returned with a letter\nfor me, and another, enclosed, for Mr. Colbrand. This seemed odd, and\nput me all in a trembling. So I shut the door; and never, sure, was the\nlike known! found the following agreeable contents:--\n\n\n'In vain, my Pamela, do I find it to struggle against my affection for\nyou. I must needs, after you were gone, venture to entertain myself with\nyour Journal, when I found Mrs. Jewkes's bad usage of you, after your\ndreadful temptations and hurts; and particularly your generous concern\nfor me, on hearing how narrowly I escaped drowning; (though my death\nwould have been your freedom, and I had made it your interest to\nwish it); and your most agreeable confession in another place, that,\nnotwithstanding all my hard usage of you, you could not hate me; and\nthat expressed in so sweet, so soft, and so innocent a manner, that I\nflatter myself you may be brought to love me: (together with the other\nparts of your admirable Journal:) I began to repent my parting with you;\nbut, God is my witness! for no unlawful end, as you would call it; but\nthe very contrary: and the rather, as all this was improved in your\nfavour, by your behaviour at leaving my house: For, oh! that melodious\nvoice praying for me at your departure, and thanking me for my rebuke\nto Mrs. Jewkes, still hangs upon my ears, and delights my memory. And\nthough I went to bed, I could not rest; but about two got up, and made\nThomas get one of the best horses ready, in order to set out to overtake\nyou, while I sat down to write this to you.\n\n'Now, my dear Pamela, let me beg of you, on the receipt of this, to\norder Robin to drive you back again to my house. I would have set out\nmyself, for the pleasure of bearing you company back in the chariot; but\nam really indisposed; I believe, with vexation that I should part thus\nwith my soul's delight, as I now find you are, and must be, in spite of\nthe pride of my own heart.\n\n'You cannot imagine the obligation your return will lay me under to your\ngoodness; and yet, if you will not so far favour me, you shall be under\nno restraint, as you will see by my letter enclosed to Colbrand; which\nI have not sealed, that you may read it. But spare me, my dearest girl!\nthe confusion of following you to your father's; which I must do, if you\npersist to go on; for I find I cannot live a day without you.\n\n'If you are the generous Pamela I imagine you to be, (for hitherto you\nhave been all goodness, where it has not been merited,) let me see, by\nthis new instance, the further excellence of your disposition; let me\nsee you can forgive the man who loves you more than himself; let me see,\nby it, that you are not prepossessed in any other person's favour: And\none instance more I would beg, and then I am all gratitude; and that is,\nthat you would despatch Monsieur Colbrand with a letter to your father,\nassuring him that all will end happily; and to desire, that he will\nsend to you, at my house, the letters you found means, by Williams's\nconveyance, to send him. And when I have all my proud, and, perhaps,\npunctilious doubts answered, I shall have nothing to do, but to make you\nhappy, and be so myself. For I must be 'Yours, and only yours.'\n\n'Monday morn, near three o'clock.'\n\n\nO my exulting heart! how it throbs in my bosom, as if it would reproach\nme for so lately upbraiding it for giving way to the love of so dear\na gentleman!--But take care thou art not too credulous neither, O fond\nbeliever! Things that we wish, are apt to gain a too ready credence with\nus. This sham-marriage is not yet cleared up: Mrs. Jewkes, the vile Mrs.\nJewkes! may yet instigate the mind of this master: His pride of heart,\nand pride of condition, may again take place: And a man that could in so\nlittle a space, first love me, then hate, then banish me his house,\nand send me away disgracefully; and now send for me again, in such\naffectionate terms, may still waver, may still deceive thee. Therefore\nwill I not acquit thee yet, O credulous, fluttering, throbbing mischief!\nthat art so ready to believe what thou wishest! And I charge thee to\nkeep better guard than thou hast lately done, and lead me not to follow\ntoo implicitly thy flattering and desirable impulses. Thus foolishly\ndialogued I with my heart; and yet, all the time, this heart is Pamela.\n\nI opened the letter to Monsieur Colbrand; which was in these words:--\n\n\n'MONSIEUR,\n\n'I am sure you'll excuse the trouble I give you. I have, for good\nreasons, changed my mind; and I have besought it, as a favour, that Mrs.\nAndrews will return to me the moment Tom reaches you. I hope, for the\nreasons I have given her, she will have the goodness to oblige me. But,\nif not, you are to order Robin to pursue his directions, and set her\ndown at her father's door. If she will oblige me in her return, perhaps\nshe'll give you a letter to her father, for some papers to be delivered\nto you for her; which you'll be so good, in that case, to bring to her\nhere: But if she will not give you such a letter, you'll return with her\nto me, if she please to favour me so far; and that with all expedition,\nthat her health and safety will permit; for I am pretty much indisposed;\nbut hope it will be but slight, and soon go off. I am 'Yours, etc.'\n\n'On second thoughts, let Tom go forward with Mrs. Andrews's letter, if\nshe pleases to give one; and you return with her, for her safety.'\n\n\nNow this is a dear generous manner of treating me. O how I love to be\ngenerously used!--Now, my dear parents, I wish I could consult you for\nyour opinions, how I should act. Should I go back, or should I\nnot?--I doubt he has got too great hold in my heart, for me to be easy\npresently, if I should refuse: And yet this gipsy information makes me\nfearful.\n\nWell, I will, I think, trust in his generosity! Yet is it not too great\na trust?--especially considering how I have been used!--But then that\nwas while he avowed his bad designs; and now he gives great hope of\nhis good ones. And I may be the means of making many happy, as well as\nmyself, by placing a generous confidence in him.\n\nAnd then, I think, he might have sent to Colbrand, or to Robin, to carry\nme back, whether I would or not. And how different is his behaviour to\nthat! And would it not look as if I was prepossessed, as he calls it, if\nI don't oblige him; and as if it was a silly female piece of pride, to\nmake him follow me to my father's; and as if I would use him hardly in\nmy turn, for his having used me ill in his? Upon the whole, I resolved\nto obey him; and if he uses me ill afterwards, double will be his\nungenerous guilt!--Though hard will be my lot, to have my credulity so\njustly blamable, as it will then seem. For, to be sure, the world, the\nwise world, that never is wrong itself, judges always by events. And if\nhe should use me ill, then I shall be blamed for trusting him: If well,\nO then I did right, to be sure!--But how would my censurers act in\nmy case, before the event justifies or condemns the action, is the\nquestion?\n\nThen I have no notion of obliging by halves; but of doing things with\na grace, as one may say, where they are to be done; and so I wrote\nthe desired letter to you, assuring you, that I had before me happier\nprospects than ever I had; and hoped all would end well: And that I\nbegged you would send me, by the bearer, Mr. Thomas, my master's groom,\nthose papers, which I had sent you by Mr. Williams's conveyance: For\nthat they imported me much, for clearing up a point in my conduct, that\nmy master was desirous to know, before he resolved to favour me, as he\nhad intended.--But you will have that letter, before you can have this;\nfor I would not send you this without the preceding; which now is in my\nmaster's hands.\n\nAnd so, having given the letter to Mr. Thomas for him to carry to\nyou, when he had baited and rested after his great fatigue, I sent for\nMonsieur Colbrand, and Robin, and gave to the former his letter; and\nwhen he had read it, I said, You see how things stand. I am resolved to\nreturn to our master; and as he is not so well as were to be wished, the\nmore haste you make the better: and don't mind my fatigue, but consider\nonly yourselves, and the horses. Robin, who guessed the matter, by his\nconversation with Thomas, (as I suppose,) said, God bless you, madam,\nand reward you, as your obligingness to my good master deserves; and may\nwe all live to see you triumph over Mrs. Jewkes!\n\nI wondered to hear him say so; for I was always careful of exposing my\nmaster, or even that naughty woman, before the common servants. But yet\nI question whether Robin would have said this, if he had not guessed,\nby Thomas's message, and my resolving to return, that I might stand well\nwith his master. So selfish are the hearts of poor mortals, that they\nare ready to change as favour goes!\n\nSo they were not long getting ready; and I am just setting out, back\nagain: and I hope I shall have no reason to repent it.\n\nRobin put on very vehemently; and when we came to the little town, where\nwe lay on Sunday night, he gave his horses a bait, and said, he would\npush for his master's that night, as it would be moon-light, if I should\nnot be too much fatigued because there was no place between that and\nthe town adjacent to his master's, fit to put up at, for the night. But\nMonsieur Colbrand's horse beginning to give way, made a doubt between\nthem: wherefore I said, (hating to be on the road,) if it could be done,\nI should bear it well enough, I hoped; and that Monsieur Colbrand\nmight leave his horse, when it failed, at some house, and come into the\nchariot. This pleased them both; and, about twelve miles short, he left\nthe horse, and took off his spurs and holsters, etc. and, with abundance\nof ceremonial excuses, came into the chariot; and I sat the easier\nfor it; for my bones ached sadly with the jolting, and so many miles\ntravelling in so few hours, as I have done, from Sunday night, five\no'clock. But, for all this, it was eleven o'clock at night, when we came\nto the village adjacent to my master's; and the horses began to be very\nmuch tired, and Robin too: but I said, It would be pity to put up only\nthree miles short of the house.\n\nSo about one we reached the gate; but every body was a-bed. But one of\nthe helpers got the keys from Mrs. Jewkes, and opened the gates; and the\nhorses could hardly crawl into the stable. And I, when I went to get out\nof the chariot, fell down, and thought I had lost the use of my limbs.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came down with her clothes huddled on, and lifted up her\nhands and eyes, at my return; but shewed more care of the horses than\nof me. By that time the two maids came; and I made shift to creep in, as\nwell as I could.\n\nIt seems my poor master was very ill indeed, and had been upon the bed\nmost part of the day; and Abraham (who succeeded John) sat up with him.\nAnd he was got into a fine sleep, and heard not the coach come in, nor\nthe noise we made; for his chamber lies towards the garden,--on the\nother side of the house. Mrs. Jewkes said, He had a feverish complaint,\nand had been blooded; and, very prudently, ordered Abraham, when he\nawaked, not to tell him I was come, for fear of surprising him, and\naugmenting his fever; nor, indeed, to say any thing of me, till she\nherself broke it to him in the morning, as she should see how he was.\n\nSo I went to bed with Mrs. Jewkes, after she had caused me to drink\nalmost half a pint of burnt wine, made very rich and cordial, with\nspices; which I found very refreshing, and set me into a sleep I little\nhoped for.\n\n\nTuesday morning.\n\nGetting up pretty early, I have written thus far, while Mrs. Jewkes lies\nsnoring in bed, fetching up her last night's disturbance. I long for her\nrising, to know how my poor master does. 'Tis well for her she can sleep\nso purely. No love, but for herself, will ever break her rest, I am\nsure. I am deadly sore all over, as if I had been soundly beaten. I did\nnot think I could have lived under such fatigue.\n\nMrs. Jewkes, as soon as she got up, went to know how my master did, and\nhe had had a good night; and, having drank plentifully of sack whey,\nhad sweated much; so that his fever had abated considerably. She said\nto him, that he must not be surprised, and she would tell him news. He\nasked, What? And she said, I was come. He raised himself up in his bed;\nCan it be? said he--What, already!--She told him I came last night.\nMonsieur Colbrand coming to inquire of his health, he ordered him to\ndraw near him, and was highly pleased with the account he gave him of\nthe journey, my readiness to come back, and my willingness to reach\nhome that night. And he said, Why, these tender fair ones, I think, bear\nfatigue better than us men. But she is very good, to give me such an\ninstance of her readiness to oblige me. Pray, Mrs. Jewkes, said he, take\ngreat care of her health! and let her be a-bed all day. She told him I\nhad been up these two hours. Ask her, said he, if she will be so good as\nto make me a visit: If she won't, I'll rise, and go to her. Indeed, sir,\nsaid she, you must be still; and I'll go to her. But don't urge her too\nmuch, said he, if she be unwilling.\n\nShe came to me, and told me all the above; and I said, I would most\nwillingly wait upon him; for, indeed, I longed to see him, and was much\ngrieved he was so ill.--So I went down with her. Will she come? said\nhe, as I entered the room. Yes, sir, said we; and she said, at the first\nword, Most willingly.--Sweet excellence! said he.\n\nAs soon as he saw me, he said, O my beloved Pamela! you have made me\nquite well. I'm concerned to return my acknowledgments to you in so\nunfit a place and manner; but will you give me your hand? I did, and\nhe kissed it with great eagerness. Sir, said I, you do me too much\nhonour!--I am sorry you are so ill.--I can't be ill, said he, while you\nare with me. I am very well already.\n\nWell, said he, and kissed my hand again, you shall not repent this\ngoodness. My heart is too full of it to express myself as I ought. But\nI am sorry you have had such a fatiguing time of it.--Life is no life\nwithout you! If you had refused me, and yet I had hardly hopes you would\noblige me, I should have had a severe fit of it, I believe; for I was\ntaken very oddly, and knew not what to make of myself: but now I shall\nbe well instantly. You need not, Mrs. Jewkes, added he, send for the\ndoctor from Stamford, as we talked yesterday; for this lovely creature\nis my doctor, as her absence was my disease.\n\nHe begged me to sit down by his bed-side, and asked me, if I had obliged\nhim with sending for my former packet? I said I had, and hoped it would\nbe brought. He said it was doubly kind.\n\nI would not stay long because of disturbing him. And he got up in the\nafternoon, and desired my company; and seemed quite pleased, easy,\nand much better. He said, Mrs. Jewkes, after this instance of my good\nPamela's obligingness in her return, I am sure we ought to leave her\nentirely at her own liberty; and pray, if she pleases to take a turn in\nour chariot, or in the garden, or to the town, or wherever she will,\nlet her be left at liberty, and asked no questions; and do you do all in\nyour power to oblige her. She said she would, to be sure.\n\nHe took my hand, and said, One thing I will tell you, Pamela, because\nI know you will be glad to hear it, and yet not care to ask me: I had,\nbefore you went, taken Williams's bond for the money; for how the poor\nman had behaved I can't tell, but he could get no bail; and if I have no\nfresh reason given me, perhaps I shall not exact the payment; and he has\nbeen some time at liberty, and now follows his school; but, methinks, I\ncould wish you would not see him at present.\n\nSir, said I, I will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully; and I am\nglad he is at liberty, because I was the occasion of his misfortunes.\nI durst say no more, though I wanted to plead for the poor gentleman;\nwhich, in gratitude, I thought I ought, when I could do him service. I\nsaid, I am sorry, sir, Lady Davers, who loves you so well, should have\nincurred your displeasure, and that there should be any variance between\nyour honour and her; I hope it was not on my account. He took out of\nhis waistcoat pocket, as he sat in his gown, his letter-case, and said,\nHere, Pamela, read that when you go up stairs, and let me have your\nthoughts upon it; and that will let you into the affair.\n\nHe said he was very heavy of a sudden, and would lie down, and indulge\nfor that day; and if he was better in the morning, would take an airing\nin the chariot. And so I took my leave for the present, and went up\nto my closet, and read the letter he was pleased to put into my hands;\nwhich is as follows:--\n\n\n'BROTHER,\n\n'I am very uneasy at what I hear of you; and must write, whether\nit please you or not, my full mind. I have had some people with me,\ndesiring me to interpose with you; and they have a greater regard for\nyour honour, than, I am sorry to say it, you have yourself. Could I\nthink, that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear\nmother's waiting-maid, and keep her a prisoner from all her friends, and\nto the disgrace of your own? But I thought, when you would not let the\nwench come to me on my mother's death, that you meant no good.--I blush\nfor you, I'll assure you. The girl was an innocent, good girl; but I\nsuppose that's over with her now, or soon will. What can you mean by\nthis, let me ask you? Either you will have her for a kept mistress, or\nfor a wife. If the former, there are enough to be had without ruining\na poor wench that my mother loved, and who really was a very good girl:\nand of this you may be ashamed. As to the other, I dare say you don't\nthink of it; but if you should, you would be utterly inexcusable.\nConsider, brother, that ours is no upstart family; but is as ancient\nas the best in the kingdom! and, for several hundreds of years, it has\nnever been known, that the heirs of it have disgraced themselves by\nunequal matches: And you know you have been sought to by some of the\nbest families in the nation, for your alliance. It might be well enough,\nif you were descended of a family of yesterday, or but a remove or two\nfrom the dirt you seem so fond of. But, let me tell you, that I, and all\nmine, will renounce you for ever, if you can descend so meanly; and I\nshall be ashamed to be called your sister. A handsome man, as you are,\nin your person; so happy in the gifts of your mind, that every body\ncourts your company; and possessed of such a noble and clear estate; and\nvery rich in money besides, left you by the best of fathers and mothers,\nwith such ancient blood in your veins, untainted! for you to throw away\nyourself thus, is intolerable; and it would be very wicked in you to\nruin the wench too. So that I beg you will restore her to her parents,\nand give her 100L. or so, to make her happy in some honest fellow of her\nown degree; and that will be doing something, and will also oblige and\npacify\n\n                                        'Your much grieved sister.'\n\n'If I have written too sharply, consider it is my love to you, and\nthe shame you are bringing upon yourself; and I wish this may have the\neffect upon you, intended by your very loving sister.'\n\n\nThis is a sad letter, my dear father and mother; and one may see how\npoor people are despised by the proud and the rich! and yet we were\nall on a foot originally: And many of these gentry, that brag of their\nancient blood, would be glad to have it as wholesome, and as really\nuntainted, as ours!--Surely these proud people never think what a short\nstage life is; and that, with all their vanity; a time is coming, when\nthey shall be obliged to submit to be on a level with us: And true said\nthe philosopher, when he looked upon the skull of a king, and that of a\npoor man, that he saw no difference between them. Besides, do they not\nknow, that the richest of princes, and the poorest of beggars, are\nto have one great and tremendous judge, at the last day; who will\nnot distinguish between them, according to their circumstances in\nlife?--But, on the contrary, may make their condemnations the greater,\nas their neglected opportunities were the greater? Poor souls! how do I\npity their pride!--O keep me, Heaven! from their high condition, if my\nmind shall ever be tainted with their vice! or polluted with so cruel\nand inconsiderate a contempt of the humble estate which they behold with\nso much scorn!\n\nBut, besides, how do these gentry know, that, supposing they could trace\nback their ancestry for one, two, three, or even five hundred years,\nthat then the original stems of these poor families, though they have\nnot kept such elaborate records of their good-for nothingness, as\nit often proves, were not still deeper rooted?--And how can they\nbe assured, that one hundred years hence, or two, some of those now\ndespised upstart families may not revel in their estates, while their\ndescendants may be reduced to the others' dunghills!--And, perhaps, such\nis the vanity, as well as changeableness, of human estates, in their\nturns set up for pride of family, and despise the others!\n\nThese reflections occurred to my thoughts, made serious by my master's\nindisposition, and this proud letter of the lowly Lady Davers, against\nthe high-minded Pamela. Lowly, I say, because she could stoop to such\nvain pride; and high-minded I, because I hope I am too proud ever to do\nthe like!--But, after all, poor wretches that we be! we scarce know what\nwe are, much less what we shall be!--But, once more pray I to be kept\nfrom the sinful pride of a high estate.\n\nOn this occasion I recall the following lines, which I have read; where\nthe poet argues in a much better manner:--\n\n    \"------------Wise Providence\n     Does various parts for various minds dispense:\n     The meanest slaves, or those who hedge and ditch,\n     Are useful, by their sweat, to feed the rich.\n     The rich, in due return, impart their store;\n     Which comfortably feeds the lab'ring poor.\n     Nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain:\n     He's equally a link of Nature's chain:\n     Labours to the same end, joins in one view;\n     And both alike the will divine pursue;\n     And, at the last, are levell'd, king and slave,\n     Without distinction, in the silent grave.\"\n\n\nWednesday morning.\n\nMy master sent me a message just now, that he was so much better, that\nhe would take a turn, after breakfast, in the chariot, and would have me\ngive him my company. I hope I shall know how to be humble, and comport\nmyself as I should do, under all these favours.\n\nMrs. Jewkes is one of the most obliging creatures in the world; and I\nhave such respects shewn me by every one, as if I was as great as Lady\nDavers--But now, if this should all end in the sham-marriage!--It cannot\nbe, I hope. Yet the pride of greatness and ancestry, and such-like,\nis so strongly set out in Lady Davers's letter, that I cannot flatter\nmyself to be so happy as all these desirable appearances make for me.\nShould I be now deceived, I should be worse off than ever. But I shall\nsee what light this new honour will procure me!--So I'll get ready. But\nI won't, I think, change my garb. Should I do it, it would look as if I\nwould be nearer on a level with him: and yet, should I not, it might be\nthought a disgrace to him: but I will, I think, open the portmanteau,\nand, for the first time since I came hither, put on my best silk\nnightgown. But then that will be making myself a sort of right to the\nclothes I had renounced; and I am not yet quite sure I shall have no\nother crosses to encounter. So I will go as I am; for, though ordinary,\nI am as clean as a penny, though I say it. So I'll e'en go as I am,\nexcept he orders otherwise. Yet Mrs. Jewkes says, I ought to dress\nas fine as I can.--But I say, I think not. As my master is up, and at\nbreakfast, I will venture down to ask him how he will have me be.\n\nWell, he is kinder and kinder, and, thank God, purely recovered!--How\ncharmingly he looks, to what he did yesterday! Blessed be God for it!\n\nHe arose, and came to me, and took me by the hand, and would set me down\nby him; and he said, My charming girl seemed going to speak. What would\nyou say?--Sir, said I, (a little ashamed,) I think it is too great an\nhonour to go into the chariot with you. No, my dear Pamela, said he; the\npleasure of your company will be greater than the honour of mine; and so\nsay no more on that head.\n\nBut, sir, said I, I shall disgrace you to go thus. You would grace a\nprince, my fair-one, said the good, kind, kind gentleman! in that dress,\nor any you shall choose: And you look so pretty, that, if you shall not\ncatch cold in that round-eared cap, you shall go just as you are. But,\nsir, said I, then you'll be pleased to go a bye-way, that it mayn't be\nseen you do so much honor to your servant. O my good girl! said he, I\ndoubt you are afraid of yourself being talked of, more than me: for I\nhope by degrees to take off the world's wonder, and teach them to expect\nwhat is to follow, as a due to my Pamela.\n\nO the dear good man! There's for you, my dear father and mother!--Did\nI not do well now to come back?--O could I get rid of my fears of this\nsham-marriage, (for all this is not yet inconsistent with that frightful\nscheme,) I should be too happy!\n\nSo I came up, with great pleasure, for my gloves: and now wait his kind\ncommands. Dear, dear sir! said I to myself, as if I was speaking to him,\nfor God's sake let me have no more trials and reverses; for I could not\nbear it now, I verily think!\n\nAt last the welcome message came, that my master was ready; and so I\nwent down as fast as I could; and he, before all the servants, handed me\nin, as if I was a lady; and then came in himself. Mrs. Jewkes begged he\nwould take care he did not catch cold, as he had been ill. And I had the\npride to hear his new coachman say, to one of his fellow-servants, They\nare a charming pair, I am sure! 'tis pity they should be parted!--O\nmy dear father and mother! I fear your girl will grow as proud as any\nthing! And, especially, you will think I have reason to guard against\nit, when you read the kind particulars I am going to relate.\n\nHe ordered dinner to be ready by two; and Abraham, who succeeds John,\nwent behind the coach. He bid Robin drive gently, and told me, he wanted\nto talk to me about his sister Davers, and other matters. Indeed, at\nfirst setting out he kissed me a little too often, that he did; and I\nwas afraid of Robin's looking back, through the fore-glass, and people\nseeing us, as they passed; but he was exceedingly kind to me, in his\nwords, as well. At last, he said,\n\nYou have, I doubt not, read, over and over, my sister's saucy letter;\nand find, as I told you, that you are no more obliged to her than I\nam. You see she intimates, that some people had been with her; and who\nshould they be, but the officious Mrs. Jervis, and Mr. Longman, and\nJonathan! and so that has made me take the measures I did in dismissing\nthem my service.--I see, said he, you are going to speak on their\nbehalfs; but your time is not come to do that, if ever I shall permit\nit.\n\nMy sister, says he, I have been beforehand with; for I have renounced\nher. I am sure I have been a kind brother to her; and gave her to the\nvalue of 3000L. more than her share came to by my father's will, when I\nentered upon my estate. And the woman, surely, was beside herself with\npassion and insolence, when she wrote me such a letter; for well she\nknew I would not bear it. But you must know, Pamela, that she is much\nincensed, that I will give no ear to a proposal of hers, of a\ndaughter of my Lord ----, who, said he, neither in person, or mind, or\nacquirements, even with all her opportunities, is to be named in a day\nwith my Pamela. But yet you see the plea, my girl, which I made to you\nbefore, of the pride of condition, and the world's censure, which, I\nown, sticks a little too close with me still: for a woman shines not\nforth to the public as man; and the world sees not your excellencies\nand perfections: If it did, I should entirely stand acquitted by the\nseverest censures. But it will be taken in the lump; that here is\nMr. B----, with such and such an estate, has married his mother's\nwaiting-maid: not considering there is not a lady in the kingdom that\ncan out-do her, or better support the condition to which she will be\nraised, if I should marry her. And, said he, putting his arm round me,\nand again kissing me, I pity my dear girl too, for her part in this\ncensure; for, here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the\nneighbouring gentry all around us. Sister Davers, you see, will never\nbe reconciled to you. The other ladies will not visit you; and you\nwill, with a merit superior to them all, be treated as if unworthy their\nnotice. Should I now marry my Pamela, how will my girl relish all this?\nWon't these be cutting things to my fair-one? For, as to me, I shall\nhave nothing to do, but, with a good estate in possession, to brazen out\nthe matter of my former pleasantry on this subject, with my companions\nof the chase, the green, and the assemblee; stand their rude jests for\nonce or twice, and my fortune will create me always respect enough, I\nwarrant you. But, I say, what will my poor girl do, as to her part, with\nher own sex? For some company you must keep. My station will not admit\nit to be with my servants; and the ladies will fly your acquaintance;\nand still, though my wife, will treat you as my mother's\nwaiting-maid.--What says my girl to this?\n\nYou may well guess, my dear father and mother, how transporting these\nkind, these generous and condescending sentiments were to me!--I thought\nI had the harmony of the spheres all around me; and every word that\ndropped from his lips was as sweet as the honey of Hybla to me.--Oh!\nsir, said I, how inexpressibly kind and good is all this! Your poor\nservant has a much greater struggle than this to go through, a more\nknotty difficulty to overcome.\n\nWhat is that? said he, a little impatiently: I will not forgive your\ndoubts now.--No, sir, said I, I cannot doubt; but it is, how I shall\nsupport, how I shall deserve your goodness to me.--Dear girl! said he,\nand hugged me to his breast, I was afraid you would have made me angry\nagain; but that I would not be, because I see you have a grateful heart;\nand this your kind and cheerful return, after such cruel usage as you\nhad experienced in my house, enough to make you detest the place, has\nmade me resolve to bear any thing in you, but doubts of my honour, at a\ntime when I am pouring out my soul, with a true and affectionate ardour,\nbefore you.\n\nBut, good sir, said I, my greatest concern will be for the rude jests\nyou will have yourself to encounter with, for thus stooping beneath\nyourself. For, as to me, considering my lowly estate, and little merit,\neven the slights and reflections of the ladies will be an honour to me:\nand I shall have the pride to place more than half their ill will to\ntheir envy at my happiness. And if I can, by the most cheerful duty, and\nresigned obedience, have the pleasure to be agreeable to you, I shall\nthink myself but too happy, let the world say what it will.\n\nHe said, You are very good, my dearest girl! But how will you bestow\nyour time, when you will have no visits to receive or pay? No parties of\npleasure to join in? No card-tables to employ your winter evenings; and\neven, as the taste is, half the day, summer and winter? And you have\noften played with my mother, too, and so know how to perform a part\nthere, as well as in the other diversions: and I'll assure you, my girl,\nI shall not desire you to live without such amusements, as my wife might\nexpect, were I to marry a lady of the first quality.\n\nO, sir, said I, you are all goodness! How shall I bear it?--But do you\nthink, sir, in such a family as yours, a person whom you shall honour\nwith the name of mistress of it, will not find useful employments for\nher time, without looking abroad for any others?\n\nIn the first place, sir, if you will give me leave, I will myself look\ninto such parts of the family economy, as may not be beneath the rank\nto which I shall have the honour of being exalted, if any such there\ncan be; and this, I hope, without incurring the ill will of any honest\nservant.\n\nThen, sir, I will ease you of as much of your family accounts, as I\npossibly can, when I have convinced you that I am to be trusted with\nthem; and you know, sir, my late good lady made me her treasurer, her\nalmoner, and every thing.\n\nThen, sir, if I must needs be visiting or visited, and the ladies won't\nhonour me so much, or even if they would now and then, I will visit, if\nyour goodness will allow me so to do, the sick poor in the neighbourhood\naround you; and administer to their wants and necessities, in such\nmatters as may not be hurtful to your estate, but comfortable to them;\nand entail upon you their blessings, and their prayers for your dear\nhealth and welfare.\n\nThen I will assist your housekeeper, as I used to do, in the making\njellies, comfits, sweetmeats, marmalades, cordials; and to pot, and\ncandy, and preserve for the uses of the family; and to make, myself, all\nthe fine linen of it for yourself and me.\n\nThen, sir, if you will sometimes indulge me with your company, I will\ntake an airing in your chariot now and then: and when you shall return\nhome from your diversions on the green, or from the chase, or where\nyou shall please to go, I shall have the pleasure of receiving you with\nduty, and a cheerful delight; and, in your absence, count the moments\ntill you return; and you will, may be, fill up some part of my time, the\nsweetest by far! with your agreeable conversation, for an hour or two\nnow and then; and be indulgent to the impertinent overflowings of my\ngrateful heart, for all your goodness to me.\n\nThe breakfasting-time, the preparations for dinner, and sometimes to\nentertain your chosen friends, and the company you shall bring home with\nyou, gentlemen, if not ladies, and the supperings, will fill up a great\npart of the day in a very necessary manner.\n\nAnd, may be, sir, now and then a good-humoured lady will drop in; and,\nI hope, if they do, I shall so behave myself, as not to add to the\ndisgrace you will have brought upon yourself: for, indeed, I will be\nvery circumspect, and try to be as discreet as I can; and as humble too,\nas shall be consistent with your honour.\n\nCards, 'tis true, I can play at, in all the usual games that our sex\ndelight in; but this I am not fond of, nor shall ever desire to play,\nunless to induce such ladies, as you may wish to see, not to abandon\nyour house for want of an amusement they are accustomed to.\n\nMusic, which our good lady taught me, will fill up some intervals, if I\nshould have any.\n\nAnd then, sir, you know, I love reading and scribbling; and though all\nthe latter will be employed in the family accounts, between the servants\nand me, and me and your good self: yet reading, at proper times, will\nbe a pleasure to me, which I shall be unwilling to give up, for the best\ncompany in the world, except yours. And, O sir! that will help to polish\nmy mind, and make me worthier of your company and conversation; and,\nwith the explanations you will give me, of what I shall not understand,\nwill be a sweet employment, and improvement too.\n\nBut one thing, sir, I ought not to forget, because it is the chief: My\nduty to God will, I hope, always employ some good portion of my time,\nwith thanks for his superlative goodness to me; and to pray for you and\nmyself: for you, sir, for a blessing on you, for your great goodness\nto such an unworthy creature: for myself, that I may be enabled to\ndischarge my duty to you, and be found grateful for all the blessings\nI shall receive at the hands of Providence, by means of your generosity\nand condescension.\n\nWith all this, sir, said I, can you think I shall be at a loss to pass\nmy time? But, as I know, that every slight to me, if I come to be so\nhappy, will be, in some measure, a slight to you, I will beg of you,\nsir, not to let me go very fine in dress; but appear only so, as that\nyou may not be ashamed of it after the honour I shall have of being\ncalled by your worthy name: for well I know, sir, that nothing so\nmuch excites the envy of my own sex, as seeing a person above them in\nappearance, and in dress. And that would bring down upon me an hundred\nsaucy things, and low-born brats, and I can't tell what!\n\nThere I stopped; for I had prattled a great deal too much so early: and\nhe said, clasping me to him, Why stops my dear Pamela?--Why does she not\nproceed? I could dwell upon your words all the day long; and you shall\nbe the directress of your own pleasures, and your own time, so sweetly\ndo you choose to employ it: and thus shall I find some of my own bad\nactions atoned for by your exemplary goodness, and God will bless me for\nyour sake.\n\nO, said he, what pleasure you give me in this sweet foretaste of my\nhappiness! I will now defy the saucy, busy censurers of the world;\nand bid them know your excellence, and my happiness, before they, with\nunhallowed lips, presume to judge of my actions, and your merit!--And\nlet me tell you, my Pamela, that I can add my hopes of a still more\npleasing amusement, and what your bashful modesty would not permit you\nto hint; and which I will no otherwise touch upon, lest it should\nseem, to your nicety, to detract from the present purity of my good\nintentions, than to say, I hope to have superadded to all these, such an\nemployment, as will give me a view of perpetuating my happy prospects,\nand my family at the same time; of which I am almost the only male.\n\nI blushed, I believe; yet could not be displeased at the decent and\ncharming manner with which he insinuated this distant hope: And oh!\njudge for me, how my heart was affected with all these things!\n\nHe was pleased to add another charming reflection, which shewed me the\nnoble sincerity of his kind professions. I do own to you, my Pamela,\nsaid he, that I love you with a purer flame than ever I knew in my whole\nlife; a flame to which I was a stranger; and which commenced for you in\nthe garden; though you, unkindly, by your unseasonable doubts, nipped\nthe opening bud, while it was too tender to bear the cold blasts of\nslight or negligence. And I know more sincere joy and satisfaction in\nthis sweet hour's conversation with you, than all the guilty tumults\nof my former passion ever did, or (had even my attempts succeeded) ever\ncould have afforded me.\n\nO, sir, said I, expect not words from your poor servant, equal to these\nmost generous professions. Both the means, and the will, I now see, are\ngiven to you, to lay me under an everlasting obligation. How happy\nshall I be, if, though I cannot be worthy of all this goodness and\ncondescension, I can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it! But I\ncan only answer for a grateful heart; and if ever I give you cause,\nwilfully, (and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfections,)\nto be disgusted with me, may I be an outcast from your house and favour,\nand as much repudiated, as if the law had divorced me from you!\n\nBut sir, continued I, though I was so unseasonable as I was in the\ngarden, you would, I flatter myself, had you then heard me, have\npardoned my imprudence, and owned I had some cause to fear, and to wish\nto be with my poor father and mother: and this I the rather say,\nthat you should not think me capable of returning insolence for your\ngoodness; or appearing foolishly ungrateful to you, when you was so kind\nto me.\n\nIndeed, Pamela, said he, you gave me great uneasiness; for I love you\ntoo well not to be jealous of the least appearance of your indifference\nto me, or preference to any other person, not excepting your parents\nthemselves. This made me resolve not to hear you; for I had not got\nover my reluctance to marriage; and a little weight, you know, turns the\nscale, when it hangs in an equal balance. But yet, you see, that though\nI could part with you, while my anger held, yet the regard I had then\nnewly professed for your virtue, made me resolve not to offer to violate\nit; and you have seen likewise, that the painful struggle I underwent\nwhen I began to reflect, and to read your moving journal, between my\ndesire to recall you, and my doubt whether you would return, (though yet\nI resolved not to force you to it,) had like to have cost me a severe\nillness: but your kind and cheerful return has dispelled all my fears,\nand given me hope, that I am not indifferent to you; and you see how\nyour presence has chased away my illness.\n\nI bless God for it, said I; but since you are so good as to encourage\nme, and will not despise my weakness, I will acknowledge, that I\nsuffered more than I could have imagined, till I experienced it, in\nbeing banished your presence in so much anger; and the more still was I\naffected, when you answered the wicked Mrs. Jewkes so generously in\nmy favour, at my leaving your house. For this, sir, awakened all my\nreverence for you; and you saw I could not forbear, not knowing what I\ndid, to break boldly in upon you, and acknowledge your goodness on my\nknees. 'Tis true, my dear Pamela, said he, we have sufficiently tortured\none another; and the only comfort that can result from it, will be,\nreflecting upon the matter coolly and with pleasure, when all these\nstorms are overblown, (as I hope they now are,) and we sit together\nsecured in each other's good opinion, recounting the uncommon gradations\nby which we have ascended to the summit of that felicity, which I hope\nwe shall shortly arrive at.\n\nMeantime, said the good gentleman, let me hear what my dear girl would\nhave said in her justification, could I have trusted myself with her, as\nto her fears, and the reason of her wishing herself from me, at a time\nthat I had begun to shew my fondness for her, in a manner that I thought\nwould have been agreeable to her and virtue.\n\nI pulled out of my pocket the gipsy letter; but I said, before I shewed\nit to him, I have this letter, sir, to shew you, as what, I believe, you\nwill allow must have given me the greatest disturbance: but, first, as\nI know not who is the writer, and it seems to be in a disguised hand, I\nwould beg it as a favour, that, if you guess who it is, which I cannot,\nit may not turn to their prejudice, because it was written, very\nprobably, with no other view, than to serve me.\n\nHe took it, and read it. And it being signed Somebody, he said, Yes,\nthis is indeed from Somebody; and, disguised as the hand is, I know the\nwriter: Don't you see, by the setness of some of these letters, and a\nlittle secretary cut here and there, especially in that c, and that r,\nthat it is the hand of a person bred in the law-way? Why, Pamela, said\nhe, 'tis old Longman's hand: an officious rascal as he is!--But I have\ndone with him. O sir, said I, it would be too insolent in me to offer\n(so much am I myself overwhelmed with your goodness,) to defend any body\nthat you are angry with: Yet, sir, so far as they have incurred your\ndispleasure for my sake, and for no other want of duty or respect, I\ncould wish--But I dare not say more.\n\nBut, said he, as to the letter and the information it contains: Let me\nknow, Pamela, when you received this? On the Friday, sir, said I, that\nyou were gone to the wedding at Stamford.--How could it be conveyed\nto you, said he, unknown to Mrs. Jewkes, when I gave her such a strict\ncharge to attend you, and you had promised me, that you would not throw\nyourself in the way of such intelligence? For, said he, when I went to\nStamford, I knew, from a private intimation given me, that there would\nbe an attempt made to see you, or give you a letter, by somebody, if not\nto get you away; but was not certain from what quarter, whether from my\nsister Davers, Mrs. Jervis, Mr. Longman, or John Arnold, or your father;\nand as I was then but struggling with myself, whether to give way to my\nhonourable inclinations, or to free you, and let you go to your father,\nthat I might avoid the danger I found myself in of the former; (for I\nhad absolutely resolved never to wound again even your ears with any\nproposals of a contrary nature;) that was the reason I desired you to\npermit Mrs. Jewkes to be so much on her guard till I came back, when I\nthought I should have decided this disputed point within myself, between\nmy pride and my inclinations.\n\nThis, good sir, said I, accounts well to me for your conduct in that\ncase, and for what you said to me and Mrs. Jewkes on that occasion: And\nI see more and more how much I may depend upon your honour and goodness\nto me.--But I will tell you all the truth. And then I recounted to him\nthe whole affair of the gipsy, and how the letter was put among the\nloose grass, etc. And he said, The man who thinks a thousand dragons\nsufficient to watch a woman, when her inclination takes a contrary bent,\nwill find all too little; and she will engage the stones in the\nstreet, or the grass in the field, to act for her, and help on her\ncorrespondence. If the mind, said he, be not engaged, I see there is\nhardly any confinement sufficient for the body; and you have told me a\nvery pretty story; and, as you never gave me any reason to question your\nveracity, even in your severest trials, I make no doubt of the truth\nof what you have now mentioned: and I will, in my turn, give you such a\nproof of mine, that you shall find it carry a conviction with it.\n\nYou must know, then, my Pamela, that I had actually formed such a\nproject, so well informed was this old rascally Somebody! and the time\nwas fixed for the very person described in this letter to be here; and I\nhad thought he should have read some part of the ceremony (as little as\nwas possible, to deceive you) in my chamber; and so I hoped to have you\nmine upon terms that then would have been much more agreeable to me than\nreal matrimony. And I did not in haste intend you the mortification of\nbeing undeceived; so that we might have lived for years, perhaps, very\nlovingly together; and I had, at the same time, been at liberty to\nconfirm or abrogate it as I pleased.\n\nO sir, said I, I am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger! But\nwhat good angel prevented the execution of this deep-laid design?\n\nWhy, your good angel, Pamela, said he; for when I began to consider,\nthat it would have made you miserable, and me not happy; that if you\nshould have a dear little one, it would be out of my own power to\nlegitimate it, if I should wish it to inherit my estate; and that, as I\nam almost the last of my family, and most of what I possess must\ndescend to a strange line, and disagreeable and unworthy persons;\nnotwithstanding that I might, in this case, have issue of my own body;\nwhen I further considered your untainted virtue, what dangers and\ntrials you had undergone by my means, and what a world of troubles I had\ninvolved you in, only because you were beautiful and virtuous, which\nhad excited all my passion for you; and reflected also upon your tried\nprudence and truth! I, though I doubted not effecting this my last plot,\nresolved to overcome myself; and, however I might suffer in struggling\nwith my affection for you, to part with you, rather than to betray\nyou under so black a veil. Besides, said he, I remember how much I had\nexclaimed against and censured an action of this kind, that had been\nattributed to one of the first men of the law, and of the kingdom, as he\nafterwards became; and that it was but treading in a path that another\nhad marked out for me; and, as I was assured, with no great satisfaction\nto himself, when he came to reflect; my foolish pride was a little\npiqued with this, because I loved to be, if I went out of the way, my\nown original, as I may call it. On all these considerations it was, that\nI rejected this project, and sent word to the person, that I had better\nconsidered of the matter, and would not have him come, till he\nheard further from me: And, in this suspense I suppose, some of your\nconfederates, Pamela, (for we have been a couple of plotters, though\nyour virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans,\nwhich my money and promises could hardly do,) one way or other got\nknowledge of it, and gave you this notice; but, perhaps, it would have\ncome too late, had not your white angel got the better of my black one,\nand inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project, just as it\nwas to have been put into execution. But yet I own, that, from these\nappearances, you were but too well justified in your fears, on this odd\nway of coming at this intelligence; and I have only one thing to blame\nyou for, that though I was resolved not to hear you in your own defence,\nyet, as you have so ready a talent at your pen, you might have cleared\nyour part of this matter up to me by a line or two; and when I had known\nwhat seeming good grounds you had for pouring cold water on a young\nflame, that was just then rising to an honourable expansion, should\nnot have imputed it, as I was apt to do, to unseasonable insult for my\ntenderness to you, on one hand; to perverse nicety, on the other; or to\n(what I was most alarmed by, and concerned for) prepossession for some\nother person: And this would have saved us both much fatigue, I of mind,\nyou of body.\n\nAnd, indeed, sir, said I, of mind too; and I could not better manifest\nthis, than by the cheerfulness with which I obeyed your recalling me to\nyour presence.\n\nAy, that, my dear Pamela, said he, and clasped me in his arms, was the\nkind, the inexpressibly kind action, that has rivetted my affections\nto you, and obliges me, in this free and unreserved manner, to pour my\nwhole soul into your bosom.\n\nI said, I had the less merit in this my return, because I was driven, by\nan irresistible impulse to it; and could not help it, if I would.\n\nThis, said he, (and honoured me by kissing my hand,) is engaging,\nindeed; if I may hope, that my Pamela's gentle inclination for her\npersecutor was the strongest motive to her return; and I so much value a\nvoluntary love in the person I would wish for my wife, that I would have\neven prudence and interest hardly named in comparison with it: And can\nyou return me sincerely the honest compliment I now make you?--In\nthe choice I have made, it is impossible I should have any view to my\ninterest. Love, true love, is the only motive by which I am induced. And\nwere I not what I am, could you give me the preference to any other you\nknow in the world, notwithstanding what has passed between us? Why,\nsaid I, should your so much obliged Pamela refuse to answer this kind\nquestion? Cruel as I have thought you, and dangerous as your views to\nmy honesty have been; you, sir, are the only person living that ever was\nmore than indifferent to me: and before I knew this to be what I blush\nnow to call it, I could not hate you, or wish you ill, though, from my\nsoul, the attempts you made were shocking, and most distasteful to me.\n\nI am satisfied, my Pamela, said he; nor shall I want to see those papers\nthat you have kindly written for to your father; though I still wish to\nsee them too, for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what\nhas passed, and to have before me the whole series of your sufferings,\nthat I may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense\nyou for them.\n\nIn this manner, my dear father and mother, did your happy daughter find\nherself blessed by her generous master! An ample recompense for all her\nsufferings did I think this sweet conversation only. A hundred tender\nthings he expressed besides, that though they never can escape my\nmemory, yet would be too tedious to write down. Oh, how I blessed God,\nand, I hope, ever shall, for all his gracious favours to his unworthy\nhandmaid! What a happy change is this! And who knows but my kind, my\ngenerous master, may put it in my power, when he shall see me not quite\nunworthy of it, to be a means, without injuring him, to dispense around\nme, to many persons, the happy influences of the condition to which\nI shall be, by his kind favour, exalted? Doubly blest shall I be, in\nparticular, if I can return the hundredth part of the obligations I owe\nto such honest good parents, to whose pious instructions and examples,\nunder God, I owe all my present happiness, and future prospects.--O\nthe joy that fills my mind on these proud hopes! on these delightful\nprospects!--It is too mighty for me, and I must sit down to ponder all\nthese things, and to admire and bless the goodness of that Providence,\nwhich has, through so many intricate mazes, made me tread the paths of\ninnocence, and so amply rewarded me for what it has itself enabled me to\ndo! All glory to God alone be ever given for it, by your poor enraptured\ndaughter!----\n\nI will now continue my most pleasing relation.\n\nAs the chariot was returning home from this sweet airing, he said, From\nall that has passed between us in this pleasing turn, my Pamela will\nsee, and will believe, that the trials of her virtue are all over from\nme: But, perhaps, there will be some few yet to come of her patience and\nhumility. For I have, at the earnest importunity of Lady Darnford, and\nher daughters, promised them a sight of my beloved girl: And so I intend\nto have their whole family, and Lady Jones, and Mrs. Peters's family, to\ndine with me once in a few days. And, since I believe you would hardly\nchoose, at present, to grace the table on the occasion, till you can do\nit in your own right, I should be glad you would not refuse coming down\nto us if I should desire it; for I would preface our nuptials, said the\ndear gentleman! O what a sweet word was that!--with their good opinion\nof your merits: and to see you, and your sweet manner, will be enough\nfor that purpose; and so, by degrees, prepare my neighbours for what\nis to follow: And they already have your character from me, and are\ndisposed to admire you.\n\nSir, said I, after all that has passed, I should be unworthy, if I could\nnot say, that I can have no will but yours: And however awkwardly\nI shall behave in such company, weighed down with a sense of\nyour obligations on one side, and my own unworthiness, with their\nobservations on the other, I will not scruple to obey you.\n\nI am obliged to you, Pamela, said he, and pray be only dressed as you\nare; for since they know your condition, and I have told them the story\nof your present dress, and how you came by it, one of the young ladies\nbegs it as a favour, that they may see you just as you are: and I am\nthe rather pleased it should be so, because they will perceive you owe\nnothing to dress, but make a much better figure with your own native\nstock of loveliness, than the greatest ladies arrayed in the most\nsplendid attire, and adorned with the most glittering jewels.\n\nO sir, said I, your goodness beholds your poor servant in a light\ngreatly beyond her merit! But it must not be expected, that others,\nladies especially, will look upon me with your favourable eyes: but,\nnevertheless, I should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb,\ntill you, for your own sake, shall order it otherwise: for, oh,\nsir, said I, I hope it will be always my pride to glory most in your\ngoodness! and it will be a pleasure to me to shew every one, that, with\nrespect to my happiness in this life, I am entirely the work of your\nbounty; and to let the world see from what a lowly original you have\nraised me to honours, that the greatest ladies would rejoice in.\n\nAdmirable Pamela! said he; excellent girl!--Surely thy sentiments are\nsuperior to those of all thy sex!--I might have addressed a hundred fine\nladies; but never, surely, could have had reason to admire one as I do\nyou.\n\nAs, my dear father and mother, I repeat these generous sayings, only\nbecause they are the effect of my master's goodness, being far from\npresuming to think I deserve one of them; so I hope you will not\nattribute it to my vanity; for I do assure you, I think I ought rather\nto be more humble, as I am more obliged: for it must be always a sign of\na poor condition, to receive obligations one cannot repay; as it is of\na rich mind, when it can confer them without expecting or needing a\nreturn. It is, on one side, the state of the human creature, compared,\non the other, to the Creator; and so, with due deference, may his\nbeneficence be said to be Godlike, and that is the highest that can be\nsaid.\n\nThe chariot brought us home at near the hour of two; and, blessed be\nGod, my master is pure well, and cheerful; and that makes me hope he\ndoes not repent him of his late generous treatment of me. He handed me\nout of the chariot, and to the parlour, with the same goodness, that\nhe shewed when he put me into it, before several of the servants. Mrs.\nJewkes came to inquire how he did. Quite well, Mrs. Jewkes, said he;\nquite well: I thank God, and this good girl, for it!--I am glad of it,\nsaid she; but I hope you are not the worse for my care, and my doctoring\nof you!--No, but the better, Mrs. Jewkes, said he; you have much obliged\nme by both.\n\nThen he said, Mrs. Jewkes, you and I have used this good girl very\nhardly.--I was afraid, sir, said she, I should be the subject of her\ncomplaints.--I assure you, said he, she has not opened her lips about\nyou. We have had a quite different subject to talk of; and I hope she\nwill forgive us both: You especially she must; because you have\ndone nothing but by my orders. But I only mean, that the necessary\nconsequence of those orders has been very grievous to my Pamela: And now\ncomes our part to make her amends, if we can.\n\nSir, said she, I always said to madam (as she called me), that you was\nvery good, and very forgiving. No, said he, I have been stark naught;\nand it is she, I hope, will be very forgiving. But all this preamble is\nto tell you, Mrs. Jewkes, that now I desire you'll study to oblige her,\nas much as (to obey me) you was forced to disoblige her before. And\nyou'll remember, that in every thing she is to be her own mistress.\n\nYes, said she, and mine too, I suppose, sir? Ay, said the generous\ngentleman, I believe it will be so in a little time.--Then, said she,\nI know how it will go with me! And so put her handkerchief to her\neyes.--Pamela, said my master, comfort poor Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nThis was very generous, already to seem to put her in my power: and I\ntook her by the hand, and said, I shall never take upon me, Mrs. Jewkes,\nto make a bad use of any opportunities that may be put into my hands by\nmy generous master; nor shall I ever wish to do you any disservice, if\nI might: for I shall consider, that what you have done, was in obedience\nto a will which it will become me also to submit to and so, if the\neffects of our obedience may be different, yet as they proceed from one\ncause, that must be always reverenced by me.\n\nSee there, Mrs. Jewkes, said my master, we are both in generous hands;\nand indeed, if Pamela did not pardon you, I should think she but half\nforgave me, because you acted by my instructions.--Well, said she,\nGod bless you both together, since it must be so; and I will double my\ndiligence to oblige my lady, as I find she will soon be.\n\nO my dear father and mother! now pray for me on another score; for\nfear I should grow too proud, and be giddy and foolish with all these\npromising things, so soothing to the vanity of my years and sex. But\neven to this hour can I pray, that God would remove from me all these\ndelightful prospects, if they were likely so to corrupt my mind, as to\nmake me proud and vain, and not acknowledge, with thankful humility,\nthe blessed Providence which has so visibly conducted me through the\ndangerous paths I have trod, to this happy moment.\n\nMy master was pleased to say, that he thought I might as well dine with\nhim, since he was alone: But I begged he would excuse me, for fear, as\nI said, such excess of goodness and condescension, all at once, should\nturn my head;--and that he would, by slower degrees, bring on my\nhappiness, lest I should not know how to bear it.\n\nPersons that doubt themselves, said he, seldom do amiss: And if there\nwas any fear of what you say, you could not have it in your thoughts:\nfor none but the presumptuous, the conceited, and the thoughtless, err\ncapitally. But, nevertheless, said he, I have such an opinion of your\nprudence, that I shall generally think what you do right, because it is\nyou that do it.\n\nSir, said I, your kind expressions shall not be thrown away upon me, if\nI can help it; for they will task me with the care of endeavouring to\ndeserve your good opinion, and your approbation, as the best rule of my\nconduct.\n\nBeing then about to go up stairs, Permit me, sir, said I, (looking about\nme with some confusion, to see that nobody was there,) thus on my knees\nto thank you, as I often wanted to do in the chariot, for all your\ngoodness to me, which shall never, I hope, be cast away upon me. And so\nI had the boldness to kiss his hand.\n\nI wonder, since, how I came to be so forward. But what could I do?--My\npoor grateful heart was like a too full river, which overflows its\nbanks: and it carried away my fear and my shamefacedness, as that does\nall before it on the surface of its waters!\n\nHe clasped me in his arms with transport, and condescendingly kneeled by\nme, and kissing me, said, O my dear obliging good girl, on my knees, as\nyou on yours, I vow to you everlasting truth and fidelity! and may God\nbut bless us both with half the pleasures that seem to be before us, and\nwe shall have no reason to envy the felicity of the greatest princes!--O\nsir, said I, how shall I support so much goodness! I am poor, indeed,\nin every thing, compared to you! and how far, very far, do you, in every\ngenerous way, leave me behind you!\n\nHe raised me, and, as I bent towards the door, led me to the stairs\nfoot, and, saluting me there again, left me to go up to my closet, where\nI threw myself on my knees in raptures of joy, and blessed that gracious\nGod, who had thus changed my distress to happiness, and so abundantly\nrewarded me for all the sufferings I had passed through.--And oh, how\nlight, how very light, do all those sufferings now appear, which then\nmy repining mind made so grievous to me!--Hence, in every state of life,\nand in all the changes and chances of it, for the future, will I trust\nin Providence, who knows what is best for us, and frequently turns the\nvery evils we most dread, to be the causes of our happiness, and of our\ndeliverance from greater.--My experiences, young as I am, as to this\ngreat point of reliance on God, are strong, though my judgment in\ngeneral may be weak and uninformed: but you'll excuse these reflections,\nbecause they are your beloved daughter's; and, so far as they are not\namiss, derive themselves from the benefit of yours and my late good\nlady's examples and instructions.\n\nI have written a vast deal in a little time; and shall only say, to\nconclude this delightful Wednesday, That in the afternoon my good master\nwas so well, that he rode out on horseback, and came home about nine at\nnight; and then stepped up to me, and, seeing me with pen and ink\nbefore me in my closet, said, I come only to tell you I am very well, my\nPamela: and since I have a letter or two to write, I will leave you to\nproceed in yours, as I suppose that was your employment, (for I had put\nby my papers at his coming up,) and so he saluted me, bid me good night,\nand went down; and I finished up to this place before I went to bed.\nMrs. Jewkes told me, if it was more agreeable to me, she would be in\nanother room; but I said, No thank you, Mrs. Jewkes; pray let me have\nyour company. And she made me a fine courtesy, and thanked me.--How\ntimes are altered!\n\n\nThursday.\n\nThis morning my master came up to me, and talked with me on various\nsubjects, for a good while together, in the most kind manner. Among\nother things, he asked me, if I chose to order any new clothes against\nmy marriage. (O how my heart flutters when he mentions this subject so\nfreely!) I said, I left every thing to his good pleasure, only repeated\nmy request, for the reasons aforegiven, that I might not be too fine.\n\nHe said, I think, my dear, it shall be very private: I hope you are not\nafraid of a sham-marriage; and pray get the service by heart, that you\nmay see nothing is omitted. I glowed between shame and delight. O how I\nfelt my cheeks burn!\n\nI said, I feared nothing, I apprehended nothing, but my own\nunworthiness. Said he, I think it shall be done within these fourteen\ndays, from this day, at this house. O how I trembled! but not with\ngrief, you may believe--What says my girl? Have you to object against\nany day of the next fourteen: because my affairs require me to go to my\nother house, and I think not to stir from this till I am happy with you?\n\nI have no will but yours, said I (all glowing like the fire, as I could\nfeel:) But, sir, did you say in the house? Ay, said he; for I care not\nhow privately it be done; and it must be very public if we go to church.\nIt is a holy rite, sir, said I; and would be better, methinks, in a holy\nplace.\n\nI see (said he, most kindly) my lovely maid's confusion; and your\ntrembling tenderness shews I ought to oblige you all I may. Therefore\nI will order my own little chapel, which has not been used for two\ngenerations, for any thing but a lumber-room, because our family seldom\nresided here long together, to be cleared and cleaned, and got ready for\nthe ceremony, if you dislike your own chamber or mine.\n\nSir, said I, that will be better than the chamber, and I hope it will\nnever be lumbered again, but kept to the use for which, as I presume, it\nhas been consecrated. O yes, said he, it has been consecrated, and that\nseveral ages ago, in my great great grandfather's time, who built that\nand the good old house together.\n\nBut now, my good girl, if I do not too much add to your sweet confusion,\nshall it be in the first seven days, or the second of this fortnight? I\nlooked down, quite out of countenance. Tell me, said he.\n\nIn the second, if you please, sir, said I.--As you please, said he most\nkindly; but I should thank you, Pamela, if you would choose the first.\nI'd rather, sir, if you please, said I, have the second. Well, said he,\nbe it so; but don't defer it till the last day of the fourteen.\n\nPray sir, said I, since you embolden me to talk on this important\nsubject, may I not send my dear father and mother word of my\nhappiness?--You may, said he; but charge them to keep it secret, till\nyou or I direct the contrary. And I told you, I would see no more of\nyour papers; but I meant, I would not without your consent: but if you\nwill shew them to me (and now I have no other motive for my curiosity,\nbut the pleasure I take in reading what you write,) I shall acknowledge\nit as a favour.\n\nIf, sir, said I, you will be pleased to let me write over again one\nsheet, I will; though I had relied upon your word, and not written them\nfor your perusal. What is that? said he: though I cannot consent to it\nbeforehand: for I more desire to see them, because they are your\ntrue sentiments at the time, and because they were not written for my\nperusal. Sir, said I, what I am loath you should see, are very severe\nreflections on the letter I received by the gipsy, when I apprehended\nyour design of the sham-marriage; though there are other things I would\nnot have you see; but that is the worst. It can't be worse, said he, my\ndear sauce-box, than I have seen already; and I will allow your treating\nme in ever so black a manner, on that occasion, because it must have a\nvery black appearance to you.--Well, sir, said I, I think I will obey\nyou before night. But don't alter a word, said he. I won't, sir, replied\nI, since you order it.\n\nWhile we were talking, Mrs. Jewkes came up, and said Thomas was\nreturned. O, said my master, let him bring up the papers: for he hoped,\nand so did I, that you had sent them by him. But it was a great balk,\nwhen he came up and said, Sir, Mr. Andrews did not care to deliver them;\nand would have it, that his daughter was forced to write that letter\nto him: and, indeed, sir, said he, the old gentleman took on sadly, and\nwould have it that his daughter was undone, or else, he said, she would\nnot have turned back, when on her way, (as I told him she did, said\nThomas,) instead of coming to them. I began to be afraid now that all\nwould be bad for me again.\n\nWell, Tom, said he, don't mince the matter; tell me, before Mrs.\nAndrews, what they said. Why, sir, both he and Goody Andrews, after\nthey had conferred together upon your letter, madam, came out, weeping\nbitterly, that grieved my very heart; and they said, Now all was over\nwith their poor daughter; and either she had written that letter by\ncompulsion, or had yielded to your honour; so they said; and was, or\nwould be ruined!\n\nMy master seemed vexed, as I feared. And I said, Pray, sir, be so good\nas to excuse the fears of my honest parents. They cannot know your\ngoodness to me.\n\nAnd so (said he, without answering me,) they refused to deliver the\npapers? Yes, and please your honour, said Thomas, though I told them,\nthat you, madam, of your own accord, on a letter I had brought you, very\ncheerfully wrote what I carried: But the old gentleman said, Why, wife,\nthere are in these papers twenty things nobody should see but ourselves,\nand especially not the 'squire. O the poor girl has had so many\nstratagems to struggle with! and now, at last, she has met with one that\nhas been too hard for her. And can it be possible for us to account for\nher setting out to come to us, and in such post haste, and, when she had\ngot above half-way, to send us this letter, and to go back again of her\nown accord, as you say; when we know that all her delight would have\nbeen to come to us and to escape from the perils she had been so long\ncontending with? And then, and please your honour, he said, he could not\nbear this; for his daughter was ruined, to be sure, before now. And so,\nsaid Thomas, the good old couple sat themselves down, and, hand-in-hand,\nleaning upon each other's shoulder, did nothing but lament.--I was\npiteously grieved, said he; but all I could say could not comfort them;\nnor would they give me the papers; though I told them I should deliver\nthem only to Mrs. Andrews herself. And so, and please your honour, I was\nforced to come away without them.\n\nMy good master saw me all bathed in tears at this description of your\ndistress and fears for me; and he said, I would not have you take on\nso. I am not angry with your father in the main; he is a good man; and\nI would have you write out of hand, and it shall be sent by the post to\nMr. Atkins, who lives within two miles of your father, and I'll enclose\nit in a cover of mine, in which I'll desire Mr. Atkins, the moment it\ncomes to his hand, to convey it safely to your father or mother; and say\nnothing of their sending their papers, that it may not make them uneasy;\nfor I want not now to see them on any other score than that of mere\ncuriosity; and that will do at any time. And so saying, he saluted me\nbefore Thomas, and with his own handkerchief wiped my eyes; and said to\nThomas, The good old folks are not to be blamed in the main. They don't\nknow my honourable intentions by their dear daughter; who, Tom, will, in\na little time, be your mistress; though I shall keep the matter private\nsome days, and would not have it spoken of by my servants out of my\nhouse.\n\nThomas said, God bless your honour! You know best. And I said, O, sir,\nyou are all goodness!--How kind is this, to forgive the disappointment,\ninstead of being angry, as I feared you would! Thomas then withdrew. And\nmy master said, I need not remind you of writing out of hand, to make\nthe good folks easy: and I will leave you to yourself for that purpose;\nonly send me down such of your papers, as you are willing I should see,\nwith which I shall entertain myself for an hour or two. But, one thing,\nadded he, I forgot to tell you: The neighbouring gentry I mentioned\nwill be here tomorrow to dine with me, and I have ordered Mrs. Jewkes to\nprepare for them. And must I, sir, said I, be shewn to them? O yes, said\nhe; that's the chief reason of their coming. And you'll see nobody equal\nto yourself: don't be concerned.\n\nI opened my papers, as soon as my master had left me; and laid out those\nbeginning on the Thursday morning he set out for Stamford, 'with\nthe morning visit he made me before I was up, and the injunctions of\nwatchfulness, etc. to Mrs. Jewkes; the next day's gipsy affair, and my\nreflections, in which I called him truly diabolical, and was otherwise\nvery severe, on the strong appearances the matter had then against him.\nHis return on Saturday, with the dread he put me in, on the offering to\nsearch me for my papers which followed those he had got by Mrs. Jewkes's\nmeans. My being forced to give them up. His carriage to me after he had\nread them, and questions to me. His great kindness to me on seeing\nthe dangers I had escaped and the troubles I had undergone. And how I\nunseasonably, in the midst of his goodness, expressed my desire of being\nsent to you, having the intelligence of a sham-marriage, from the gipsy,\nin my thoughts. How this enraged him, and made him turn me that very\nSunday out of his house, and send me on my way to you. The particulars\nof my journey, and my grief at parting with him; and my free\nacknowledgment to you, that I found, unknown to myself, I had begun to\nlove him, and could not help it. His sending after me, to beg my return;\nbut yet generously leaving me at my liberty, when he might have forced\nme to return whether I was willing or not. My resolution to oblige him,\nand fatiguing journey back. My concern for his illness on my return. His\nkind reception of me, and shewing me his sister Davers's angry\nletter, against his behaviour to me, desiring him to set me free, and\nthreatening to renounce him as a brother, if he should degrade himself\nby marrying me. My serious reflections on this letter, etc.' (all which,\nI hope, with the others, you will shortly see.) And this carried matters\ndown to Tuesday night last.\n\nAll that followed was so kind on his side, being our chariot conference,\nas above, on Wednesday morning, and how good he has been ever since,\nthat I thought I would go no further; for I was a little ashamed to be\nso very open on that tender and most grateful subject; though his great\ngoodness to me deserves all the acknowledgments I can possibly make.\n\nAnd when I had looked these out, I carried them down myself into the\nparlour to him; and said, putting them into his hands, Your allowances,\ngood sir, as heretofore; and if I have been too open and free in my\nreflections or declarations, let my fears on one side, and my sincerity\non the other, be my excuse. You are very obliging, my good girl, said\nhe. You have nothing to apprehend from my thoughts, any more than from\nmy actions.\n\nSo I went up, and wrote the letter to you, briefly acquainting you\nwith my present happiness, and my master's goodness, and expressing the\ngratitude of heart, which I owe to the kindest gentleman in the world,\nand assuring you, that I should soon have the pleasure of sending back\nto you, not only those papers, but all that succeeded them to this time,\nas I know you delight to amuse yourself in your leisure hours with my\nscribble: And I said, carrying it down to my master, before I sealed it,\nWill you please, sir, to take the trouble of reading what I write to my\ndear parents? Thank you, Pamela, said he, and set me on his knee, while\nhe read it; and seemed much pleased with it; and giving it me again, You\nare very happy, said he, my beloved girl, in your style and expressions:\nand the affectionate things you say of me are inexpressibly obliging;\nand again, with this kiss, said he, do I confirm for truth all that you\nhave promised for my intentions in this letter.--O what halcyon days are\nthese! God continue them!--A change would kill me quite.\n\nHe went out in his chariot in the afternoon; and in the evening\nreturned, and sent me word, he would be glad of my company for a little\nwalk in the garden; and down I went that very moment.\n\nHe came to meet me. So, says he, how does my dear girl do now?--Whom do\nyou think I have seen since I have been out?--I don't know, sir, said I.\nWhy, said he, there is a turning in the road, about five miles off,\nthat goes round a meadow, that has a pleasant foot-way, by the side of a\nlittle brook, and a double row of limes on each side, where now and\nthen the gentry in the neighbourhood walk, and angle, and divert\nthemselves.--I'll shew it you next opportunity.--And I stept out of my\nchariot, to walk across this meadow, and bid Robin meet me with it on\nthe further part of it: And whom should I 'spy there, walking, with a\nbook in his hand, reading, but your humble servant Mr. Williams! Don't\nblush, Pamela, said he. As his back was towards me, I thought I would\nspeak to the man: and, before he saw me, I said, How do you, old\nacquaintance? (for, said he, you know we were of one college for a\ntwelvemonth.) I thought the man would have jumped into the brook, he\ngave such a start at hearing my voice, and seeing me.\n\nPoor man! said I. Ay, said he, but not too much of your poor man, in\nthat soft accent, neither, Pamela.--Said I, I am sorry my voice is so\nstartling to you, Mr. Williams. What are you reading? Sir, said he, and\nstammered with the surprise, it is the French Telemachus; for I am about\nperfecting myself, if I can, in the French tongue.--Thought I, I had\nrather so, than perfecting my Pamela in it.--You do well, replied\nI.--Don't you think that yonder cloud may give us a small shower? and it\ndid a little begin to wet.--He said, he believed not much.\n\nIf, said I, you are for the village, I'll give you a cast; for I shall\ncall at Sir Simon's in my return from the little round I am taking. He\nasked me if it was not too great a favour?--No, said I, don't talk of\nthat; let us walk to the further opening there, and we shall meet my\nchariot.\n\nSo, Pamela, continued my master, we fell into conversation as we walked.\nHe said he was very sorry he had incurred my displeasure; and the more,\nas he had been told, by Lady Jones, who had it from Sir Simon's family,\nthat I had a more honourable view than at first was apprehended. I\nsaid, We fellows of fortune, Mr. Williams, take sometimes a little more\nliberty with the world than we ought to do; wantoning, very probably,\nas you contemplative folks would say, in the sunbeams of a dangerous\naffluence; and cannot think of confining ourselves to the common paths,\nthough the safest and most eligible, after all. And you may believe I\ncould not very well like to be supplanted in a view that lay next my\nheart; and that by an old acquaintance, whose good, before this affair,\nI was studious to promote.\n\nI would only say, sir, said he, that my first motive was entirely such\nas became my function: And, very politely, said my master, he added, And\nI am very sure, that however inexcusable I might seem in the progress\nof the matter, yourself, sir, would have been sorry to have it said, you\nhad cast your thoughts on a person, that nobody could have wished for\nbut yourself.\n\nWell, Mr. Williams, said I, I see you are a man of gallantry, as well as\nreligion: But what I took most amiss was, that, if you thought me doing\na wrong thing, you did not expostulate with me upon it, as your function\nmight have allowed you to do; but immediately determined to counterplot\nme, and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have robbed\nme of, and that from my own house. But the matter is at an end, and I\nretain not any malice upon it; though you did not know but I might, at\nlast, do honourably by her, as I actually intend.\n\nI am sorry for myself, sir, said he, that I should so unhappily\nincur your displeasure; but I rejoice for her sake in your honourable\nintentions: give me leave only to say, that if you make Miss Andrews\nyour lady, she will do credit to your choice with every body that\nsees her, or comes to know her; and, for person and mind both, you may\nchallenge the county.\n\nIn this manner, said my master, did the parson and I confabulate; and\nI set him down at his lodgings in the village. But he kept your secret,\nPamela; and would not own, that you gave any encouragement to his\naddresses.\n\nIndeed, sir, said I, he could not say that I did; and I hope you believe\nme. I do, I do, said he: but 'tis still my opinion, that if, when I saw\nplots set up against my plots, I had not discovered the parson as I did,\nthe correspondence between you might have gone to a length that would\nhave put our present situation out of both our powers.\n\nSir, said I, when you consider, that my utmost presumption could not\nmake me hope for the honour you now seem to design me; that I was so\nhardly used, and had no prospect before me but dishonour, you will allow\nthat I should have seemed very little in earnest in my professions of\nhonesty, if I had not endeavoured to get away: but yet I resolved not\nto think of marriage; for I never saw the man I could love, till your\ngoodness emboldened me to look up to you.\n\nI should, my dear Pamela, said he, make a very ill compliment to my\nvanity, if I did not believe you; though, at the same time, justice\ncalls upon me to say, that it is, some things considered, beyond my\nmerit.\n\nThere was a sweet, noble expression for your poor daughter, my dear\nfather and mother!--And from my master too!\n\nI was glad to hear this account of the interview between Mr. Williams\nand himself; but I dared not to say so. I hope in time he will be\nreinstated in his good graces.\n\nHe was so good as to tell me, he had given orders for the chapel to\nbe cleared. O how I look forward with inward joy, yet with fear and\ntrembling!\n\n\nFriday.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock came Sir Simon, and his lady and two daughters; and\nLady Jones, and a sister-in-law of hers; and Mr. Peters, and his\nspouse and niece. Mrs. Jewkes, who is more and more obliging, was much\nconcerned I was not dressed in some of my best clothes, and made me many\ncompliments.\n\nThey all went into the garden for a walk, before dinner; and, I\nunderstood, were so impatient to see me, that my master took them into\nthe largest alcove, after they had walked two or three turns, and stept\nhimself to me. Come, my Pamela, said he, the ladies can't be satisfied\nwithout seeing you, and I desire you'll come. I said, I was ashamed; but\nI would obey him. Said he, The two young ladies are dressed out in their\nbest attire; but they make not such an appearance as my charming girl\nin this ordinary garb.--Sir, said I, shan't I follow you thither? For\nI can't bear you should do me so much honour. Well, said he, I'll go\nbefore you. And he bid Mrs. Jewkes bring a bottle of sack, and some\ncake. So he went down to them.\n\nThis alcove fronts the longest gravel-walk in the garden, so that\nthey saw me all the way I came, for a good way: and my master told me\nafterwards, with pleasure, all they said of me.\n\nWill you forgive the little vain slut, your daughter, if I tell you all,\nas he was pleased to tell me? He said, 'spying me first, Look, there,\nladies, comes my pretty rustic!--They all, I saw, which dashed me, stood\nat the windows, and in the door-way, looking full at me.\n\nMy master told me, that Lady Jones said, She is a charming creature, I\nsee that, at this distance. And Sir Simon, it seems, who has been a sad\nrake in his younger days, swore he never saw so easy an air, so fine\na shape, and so graceful a presence.--The Lady Darnford said, I was a\nsweet girl. And Mrs. Peters said very handsome things. Even the parson\nsaid, I should be the pride of the county. O, dear sirs! all this was\nowing to the light my good master's favour placed me in, which made\nme shine out in their eyes beyond my deserts. He said the young ladies\nblushed, and envied me.\n\nWhen I came near, he saw me in a little confusion, and was so kind as\nto meet me: Give me your hand, said he, my poor girl; you walk too fast,\n(for, indeed, I wanted to be out of their gazing). I did so, with a\ncourtesy, and he led me up the steps of the alcove, and, in a most\ngentleman-like manner, presented me to the ladies, and they all saluted\nme, and said, They hoped to be better acquainted with me: and\nLady Darnford was pleased to say, I should be the flower of their\nneighbourhood. Sir Simon said, Good neighbour, by your leave; and\nsaluting me, added, Now will I say, that I have kissed the loveliest\nmaiden in England. But, for all this, methought I owed him a grudge\nfor a tell-tale, though all had turned out so happily. Mr. Peters very\ngravely followed his example, and said, like a bishop, God bless you,\nfair excellence! said Lady Jones, Pray, dear madam, sit down by me:\nand they all sat down: But I said, I would stand, if they pleased.\nNo, Pamela, said my master: pray sit down with these good ladies, my\nneighbours:--They will indulge it to you, for my sake, till they know\nyou better; and for your own, when they are acquainted with you. Sir,\nsaid I, I shall be proud to deserve their indulgence.\n\nThey all so gazed at me, that I could not look up; for I think it is one\nof the distinctions of persons of condition, and well-bred people, to\nput bashful bodies out of countenance. Well, Sir Simon, said my master,\nwhat say you now to my pretty rustic?--He swore a great oath, that he\nshould better know what to say to me if he was as young as himself. Lady\nDarnford said, You will never leave, Sir Simon.\n\nSaid my master, You are a little confused, my good girl, and out of\nbreath; but I have told all my kind neighbours here a good deal of your\nstory, and your excellence. Yes, said Lady Darnford, my dear neighbour,\nas I will call you; we that are here present have all heard of your\nuncommon story. Madam, said I, you have then heard what must make your\nkind allowance for me very necessary. No, said Mrs. Peters, we have\nheard what will always make you valued as an honour to our sex, and as\na worthy pattern for all the young ladies in the county. You are very\ngood, madam, said I, to make me able to look up, and to be thankful for\nthe honour you are pleased to do me.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came in with the canary, brought by Nan, to the alcove, and\nsome cakes on a silver salver; and I said, Mrs. Jewkes, let me be your\nassistant; I will serve the ladies with the cake. And so I took the\nsalver, and went round to the good company with it, ending with my\nmaster. The Lady Jones said, She never was served with such a grace,\nand it was giving me too much trouble. O, madam, said I, I hope my good\nmaster's favour will never make me forget, that it is my duty to wait\nupon his friends. Master, sweet one! said Sir Simon, I hope you won't\nalways call Mr. B---- by that name, for fear it should become a fashion\nfor all our ladies to do the like through the county. I, sir, said I,\nshall have many reasons to continue this style, which cannot affect your\ngood ladies.\n\nSir Simon, said Lady Jones, you are very arch upon us but I see very\nwell, that it will be the interest of all the gentlemen, to bring their\nladies into an intimacy with one that can give them such a good example.\nI am sure then, madam, said I, it must be after I have been polished and\nimproved by the honour of such an example as yours.\n\nThey all were very good and affable; and the young Lady Darnford, who\nhad wished to see me in this dress, said, I beg your pardon, dear miss,\nas she called me; but I had heard how sweetly this garb became you, and\nwas told the history of it; and I begged it, as a favour, that you\nmight oblige us with your appearance in it. I am much obliged to your\nladyship, said I, that your kind prescription was so agreeable to my\nchoice. Why, said she, was it your choice then?--I am glad of that:\nthough I am sure your person must give, and not take, ornament from any\ndress.\n\nYou are very kind, madam, said I: but there will be the less reason to\nfear I should forget the high obligations I should have to the kindest\nof gentlemen, when I can delight to shew the humble degree from which\nhis goodness had raised me.--My dear Pamela, said my master, if you\nproceed at this rate, I must insist upon your first seven days. You know\nwhat I mean. Sir, said I, you are all goodness!\n\nThey drank a glass of sack each, and Sir Simon would make me do so too,\nsaying, It will be a reflection, madam, upon all the ladies, if you\ndon't do as they. No, Sir Simon, said I, that can't be, because the\nladies' journey hither makes a glass of canary a proper cordial for\nthem: but I won't refuse; because I will do myself the honour of\ndrinking good health to you, and to all this worthy company.\n\nSaid good Lady Darnford, to my master, I hope, sir, we shall have Mrs.\nAndrews's company at table. He said, very obligingly, Madam, it is her\ntime now; and I will leave it to her choice. If the good ladies, then,\nwill forgive me, sir, said I, I had rather be excused. They all said,\nI must not be excused. I begged I might. Your reason for it, my dear\nPamela? said my master: since the ladies request it, I wish you would\noblige them. Sir, replied I, your goodness will make me, every day,\nworthier of the honour the ladies do me; and when I can persuade myself\nthat I am more worthy of it than at present, I shall with great joy\nembrace all the opportunities they will be pleased to give me.\n\nMrs. Peters whispered Lady Jones, as my master told me afterwards; Did\nyou ever see such excellence, such prudence, and discretion? Never in my\nlife, said the other good lady. She will adorn, she was pleased to say,\nher distinction. Ay, says Mrs. Peters, she would adorn any station in\nlife.\n\nMy good master was highly delighted, generous gentleman as he is! with\nthe favourable opinion of the ladies; and I took the more pleasure in\nit, because their favour seemed to lessen the disgrace of his stooping\nso much beneath himself.\n\nLady Darnford said, We will not oppress you; though we could almost\nblame your too punctilious exactness: but if we excuse Miss Andrews from\ndinner, we must insist upon her company at the card-table, and at a dish\nof tea; for we intend to pass the whole day with you, sir, as we told\nyou. What say you to that, Pamela, said my master. Sir, replied I,\nwhatever you and the ladies please, I will cheerfully do. They said, I\nwas very obliging. But Sir Simon rapt out an oath, and said, That they\nmight dine together, if they would; but he would dine with me, and\nnobody else: for, said he, I say, sir, as Parson Williams said, (by\nwhich I found my master had told them the story,) You must not think you\nhave chosen one that nobody can like but yourself.\n\nThe young ladies said, If I pleased they would take a turn about the\ngarden with me. I answered, I would very gladly attend them; and so we\nthree, and Lady Jones's sister-in-law, and Mr. Peters's niece, walked\ntogether. They were very affable, kind, and obliging; and we soon\nentered into a good deal of familiarity; and I found Miss Darnford a\nvery agreeable person. Her sister was a little more on the reserve; and\nI afterwards heard, that, about a year before, she would fain have had\nmy master make his addresses to her: but though Sir Simon is reckoned\nrich, she was not thought sufficient fortune for him. And now, to have\nhim look down so low as me, must be a sort of mortification to a poor\nyoung lady!--And I pitied her.--Indeed I did!--I wish all young persons\nof my sex could be as happy as I am like to be.\n\nMy master told me afterwards, that I left the other ladies, and Sir\nSimon and Mr. Peters, full of my praises: so that they could hardly talk\nof any thing else; one launching out upon my complexion, another upon my\neyes, my hand, and, in short, for you'll think me sadly proud, upon\nmy whole person and behaviour; and they all magnified my readiness and\nobligingness in my answers, and the like: And I was glad of it, as I\nsaid, for my good master's sake, who seemed quite pleased and rejoiced.\nGod bless him for his goodness to me!\n\nDinner not being ready, the young ladies proposed a tune upon the\nspinnet. I said, I believed it was not in tune. They said, they knew\nit was but a few months ago. If it is, said I, I wish I had known it;\nthough indeed, ladies, added I, since you know my story, I must own,\nthat my mind has not been long in tune, to make use of it. So they would\nmake me play upon it, and sing to it; which I did, a song my dear good\nlady made me learn, and used to be pleased with, and which she brought\nwith her from Bath: and the ladies were much taken with the song, and\nwere so kind as to approve my performance: And Miss Darnford was pleased\nto compliment me, that I had all the accomplishments of my sex. I said,\nI had had a good lady, in my master's mother, who had spared no\npains nor cost to improve me. She said, she wished Mr. B---- could be\nprevailed upon to give a ball on an approaching happy occasion, that we\nmight have a dancing-match, etc.--But I can't say I do; though I did not\nsay so: for these occasions, I think, are too solemn for the principals,\nat least of our sex, to take part in, especially if they have the same\nthoughts of that solemnity that I have: For, indeed, though I have\nbefore me a prospect of happiness, that may be envied by ladies of high\nrank, yet I must own to you, my dear parents, that I have something\nvery awful upon my mind, when I think of the matter; and shall, more and\nmore, as it draws nearer and nearer. This is the song:\n\n\n                  I.\n\n    Go, happy paper, gently steal,\n      And underneath her pillow lie;\n    There, in soft dreams, my love reveal,\n    That love which I must still conceal,\n      And, wrapt in awful silence, die.\n\n                 II.\n\n    Should flames be doom'd thy hapless fate,\n      To atoms thou wouldst quickly turn:\n    My pains may bear a longer date;\n    For should I live, and should she hate,\n      In endless torments I should burn.\n\n                III.\n\n    Tell fair AURELIA, she has charms,\n      Might in a hermit stir desire.\n    T' attain the heav'n that's in her arms,\n    I'd quit the world's alluring harms,\n      And to a cell content, retire.\n\n                 IV.\n\n    Of all that pleas'd my ravish'd eye,\n      Her beauty should supply the place;\n    Bold Raphael's strokes, and Titian's dye,\n    Should but in vain presume to vie\n      With her inimitable face.\n\n                  V.\n\n    No more I'd wish for Phoebus' rays,\n      To gild the object of my sight;\n    Much less the taper's fainter blaze:\n    Her eyes should measure out my days;\n\n      And when she slept, it should be night.\n\n\nAbout four o'clock.\n\nMy master just came up to me, and said, If you should see Mr. Williams\nbelow, do you think, Pamela, you should not be surprised?--No, sir, said\nI, I hope not. Why should I? Expect, said he, a stranger then, when you\ncome down to us in the parlour; for the ladies are preparing themselves\nfor the card-table, and they insist upon your company.--You have a mind,\nsir, said I, I believe, to try all my courage. Why, said he, does\nit want courage to see him? No, sir, said I, not at all. But I was\ngrievously dashed to see all those strange ladies and gentlemen; and now\nto see Mr. Williams before them, as some of them refused his application\nfor me, when I wanted to get away, it will a little shock me, to see\nthem smile, in recollecting what has passed of that kind. Well, said he,\nguard your heart against surprises, though you shall see, when you\ncome down, a man that I can allow you to love dearly; though hardly\npreferably to me.\n\nThis surprises me much. I am afraid he begins to be jealous of me. What\nwill become of me, (for he looked very seriously,) if any turn should\nhappen now!--My heart aches! I know not what's the matter. But I will\ngo down as brisk as I can, that nothing may be imputed to me. Yet I\nwish this Mr. Williams had not been there now, when they are all there;\nbecause of their fleers at him and me. Otherwise I should be glad to\nsee the poor gentleman; for, indeed, I think him a good man, and he has\nsuffered for my sake.\n\n\nSo, I am sent for down to cards. I'll go; but wish I may continue their\ngood opinions of me: for I shall be very awkward. My master, by his\nserious question, and bidding me guard my heart against surprises,\nthough I should see, when I came down, a man he can allow me to love\ndearly, though hardly better than himself, has quite alarmed me, and\nmade me sad!--I hope he loves me!--But whether he does or not, I am in\nfor it now, over head and ears, I doubt, and can't help loving him; 'tis\na folly to deny it. But to be sure I can't love any man preferably to\nhim. I shall soon know what he means.\n\n\nNow, my dear mother, must I write to you. Well might my good master say\nso mysteriously as he did, about guarding my heart against surprises. I\nnever was so surprised in my life; and never could see a man I loved\nso dearly!--O my dear mother, it was my dear, dear father, and not Mr.\nWilliams, that was below ready to receive and to bless your daughter!\nand both my master and he enjoined me to write how the whole matter was,\nand what my thoughts were on this joyful occasion.\n\nI will take the matter from the beginning, that Providence directed his\nfeet to this house, to this time, as I have had it from Mrs. Jewkes,\nfrom my master, my father, the ladies, and my own heart and conduct, as\nfar as I know of both; because they command it, and you will be pleased\nwith my relation and so, as you know how I came by the connexion, will\nmake one uniform relation of it.\n\nIt seems, then, my dear father and you were so uneasy to know the truth\nof the story which Thomas had told you, that fearing I was betrayed, and\nquite undone, he got leave of absence, and set out the day after Thomas\nwas there; and so, on Friday morning, he got to the neighbouring town;\nand there he heard, that the gentry in the neighbourhood were at\nmy master's, at a great entertainment. He put on a clean shirt and\nneckcloth (which he brought in his pocket) at an alehouse there, and got\nshaved; and so, after he had eaten some bread and cheese, and drank\na can of ale, he set out for my master's house, with a heavy heart,\ndreading for me, and in much fear of being brow-beaten. He had, it\nseems, asked, at the alehouse, what family the 'squire had down here, in\nhopes to hear something of me: And they said, A housekeeper, two maids,\nand, at present, two coachmen, and two grooms, a footman, and a helper.\nWas that all? he said. They told him, there was a young creature there,\nbelike who was, or was to be, his mistress, or somewhat of that nature;\nbut had been his mother's waiting-maid. This, he said, grieved his\nheart, and confirmed his fears.\n\nSo he went on, and about three o'clock in the afternoon came to the\ngate; and, ringing there, Sir Simon's coachman went to the iron gate;\nand he asked for the housekeeper; though, from what I had written, in\nhis heart he could not abide her. She sent for him in, little thinking\nwho he was, and asked him, in the little hall, what his business with\nher was?--Only, madam, said he, whether I cannot speak one word with the\n'squire? No, friend, said she; he is engaged with several gentlemen and\nladies. Said he, I have business with his honour of greater consequence\nto me than either life or death; and tears stood in his eyes.\n\nAt that she went into the great parlour, where my master was talking\nvery pleasantly with the ladies; and she said, Sir, here is a good tight\nold man, that wants to see you on business of life and death, he says,\nand is very earnest. Ay, said he, Who can that be?--Let him stay in the\nlittle hall, and I'll come to him presently. They all seemed to stare;\nand Sir Simon said, No more nor less, I dare say, my good friend, but\na bastard-child. If it is, said Lady Jones, bring it in to us. I will,\nsaid he.\n\nMrs. Jewkes tells me, my master was much surprised, when he saw who it\nwas; and she much more, when my dear father said,--Good God! give me\npatience! but, as great as you are, sir, I must ask for my child! and\nburst out into tears. (O what trouble have I given you both!) My master\nsaid, taking him by the hand, Don't be uneasy, Goodman Andrews; your\ndaughter is in the way to be happy.\n\nThis alarmed my dear father, and he said, What! then, is she dying? And\ntrembled, he could scarce stand. My master made him sit down, and sat\ndown by him, and said, No; God be praised! she is very well: And pray\nbe comforted; I cannot bear to see you thus apprehensive; but she has\nwritten you a letter to assure you, that she has reason to be well\nsatisfied, and happy.\n\nAh, sir I said he, you told me once she was in London, waiting on a\nbishop's lady, when all the time she was a severe prisoner here.--Well,\nthat's all over now, Goodman Andrews, said my master: but the times are\naltered; for now the sweet girl has taken me prisoner; and in a few days\nI shall put on the most agreeable fetters that ever man wore.\n\nO, sir! said, he, you are too pleasant for my griefs. My heart's almost\nbroke. But may I not see my poor child? You shall presently, said he;\nfor she is coming down to us; and since you won't believe me, I hope you\nwill her.\n\nI will ask you, good sir, said he, but one question till then, that\nI may know how to look upon her when I see her. Is she honest? Is she\nvirtuous?--As the new-born babe, Mr. Andrews, said my good master; and\nin twelve days time, I hope, will be my wife.\n\nO flatter me not, good your honour, said he: It cannot be! it cannot\nbe!--I fear you have deluded her with strange hopes; and would make\nme believe impossibilities!--Mrs. Jewkes, said he, do you tell my dear\nPamela's good father, when I go out, all you know concerning me, and\nyour mistress that is to be. Meantime, make much of him, and set out\nwhat you have; and make him drink a glass of what he likes best. If this\nbe wine, added he, fill me a bumper.\n\nShe did so; and he took my father by the hand, and said, Believe me,\ngood man, and be easy; for I can't bear to see you tortured in this\ncruel suspense: Your dear daughter is the beloved of my soul. I am glad\nyou are come: for you'll see us all in the same story. And here's your\ndame's health; and God bless you both, for being the happy means of\nprocuring for me so great a blessing! And so he drank a bumper to this\nmost obliging health.\n\nWhat do I hear? It cannot surely be! said my father. And your honour is\ntoo good, I hope, to mock a poor old man--This ugly story, sir, of the\nbishop, runs in my head--But you say I shall see my dear child--And I\nshall see her honest.--If not, poor as I am, I would not own her.\n\nMy master bid Mrs. Jewkes not to let me know yet, that my father\nwas come; and went to the company, and said, I have been agreeably\nsurprised: Here is honest old Goodman Andrews come full of grief to see\nhis daughter; for he fears she is seduced; and tells me, good honest\nman, that, poor as he is, he will not own her, if she be not virtuous.\nO, said they all, with one voice almost, Dear sir! shall we not see the\ngood old man you have so praised for his plain good sense, and honest\nheart? If, said he, I thought Pamela would not be too much affected with\nthe surprise, I would make you all witness to their first interview; for\nnever did daughter love a father, or a father a daughter, as they two do\none another. Miss Darnford, and all the ladies, and the gentlemen too,\nbegged it might be so. But was not this very cruel, my dear mother? For\nwell might they think I should not support myself in such an agreeable\nsurprise.\n\nHe said, kindly, I have but one fear, that the dear girl may be too much\naffected. O, said Lady Darnford, we'll all help to keep up her spirits.\nSays he, I'll go up, and prepare her; but won't tell her of it. So he\ncame up to me, as I have said, and amused me about Mr. Williams, to half\nprepare me for some surprise; though that could not have been any thing\nto this: and he left me, as I said, in that suspense, at his mystical\nwords, saying, He would send to me, when they were going to cards.\n\nMy master went from me to my father, and asked if he had eaten any\nthing. No, said Mrs. Jewkes; the good man's heart is so full, he cannot\neat, nor do any thing, till he has seen his dear daughter. That shall\nsoon be, said my master. I will have you come in with me; for she is\ngoing to sit down with my guests, to a game at quadrille; and I will\nsend for her down. O, sir, said my father, don't, don't let me; I am not\nfit to appear before your guests; let me see my daughter by myself,\nI beseech you. Said he, They all know your honest character, Goodman\nAndrews, and long to see you, for Pamela's sake.\n\nSo he took my father by the hand, and led him in, against his will, to\nthe company. They were all very good. My master kindly said, Ladies and\ngentlemen, I present to you one of the honestest men in England, my good\nPamela's father. Mr. Peters went to him, and took him by the hand, and\nsaid, We are all glad to see you, sir; you are the happiest man in the\nworld in a daughter; whom we never saw before to-day, but cannot enough\nadmire.\n\nSaid my master, This gentleman, Goodman Andrews, is the minister of the\nparish; but is not young enough for Mr. Williams. This airy expression,\nmy poor father said, made him fear, for a moment, that all was a\njest.--Sir Simon also took him by the hand, and said, Ay, you have a\nsweet daughter, Honesty; we are all in love with her. And the ladies\ncame, and said very fine things: Lady Darnford particularly, That he\nmight think himself the happiest man in England, in such a daughter. If,\nand please you, madam, said he, she be but virtuous, 'tis all in all:\nFor all the rest is accident. But I doubt his honour has been too much\nupon the jest with me. No, said Mrs. Peters, we are all witnesses, that\nhe intends very honourably by her.--It is some comfort, said he, and\nwiped his eyes, that such good ladies say so--But I wish I could see\nher.\n\nThey would have had him sit down by them; but he would only sit behind\nthe door, in the corner of the room, so that one could not soon see him\nas one came in; because the door opened against him, and hid him almost.\nThe ladies all sat down; and my master said, Desire Mrs. Jewkes to step\nup, and tell Mrs. Andrews the ladies wait for her. So down I came.\n\nMiss Darnford rose, and met me at the door, and said, Well, Miss\nAndrews, we longed for your company. I did not see my dear father; and\nit seems his heart was too full to speak; and he got up, and sat down\nthree or four times successively, unable to come to me, or to say any\nthing. The ladies looked that way: but I would not, supposing it was\nMr. Williams. And they made me sit down between Lady Darnford and\nLady Jones; and asked me, what we should play at? I said, At what your\nladyships please. I wondered to see them smile, and look upon me, and to\nthat corner of the room; but I was afraid of looking that way, for fear\nof seeing Mr. Williams; though my face was that way too, and the table\nbefore me.\n\nSaid my master, Did you send your letter away to the posthouse, my good\ngirl, for your father? To be sure, sir, said I, I did not forget that:\nI took the liberty to desire Mr. Thomas to carry it. What, said he, I\nwonder, will the good old couple say to it? O sir, said I, your goodness\nwill be a cordial to their dear honest hearts! At that, my dear father,\nnot able to contain himself, nor yet to stir from the place, gushed out\ninto a flood of tears, which he, good soul! had been struggling with, it\nseems; and cried out, O my dear child!\n\nI knew the voice, and, lifting up my eyes, and seeing my father, gave a\nspring, overturned the table, without regard to the company, and threw\nmyself at his feet: O my father! my father! said I, can it be?--Is it\nyou? Yes, it is! it is!--O bless your happy daughter! I would have said,\nand down I sunk.\n\nMy master seemed concerned--I feared, said he, that the surprise would\nbe too much for her spirits; and all the ladies ran to me, and made me\ndrink a glass of water; and I found myself encircled in the arms of my\ndearest father.--O tell me, said I, every thing! How long have you been\nhere? When did you come? How does my honoured mother? And half a dozen\nquestions more, before he could answer one.\n\nThey permitted me to retire with my father; and then I poured forth\nall my vows and thanksgivings to God for this additional blessing; and\nconfirmed all my master's goodness to his scarce-believing amazement.\nAnd we kneeled together, blessing God, and one another, for several\necstatic minutes and my master coming in soon after, my dear father\nsaid, O sir, what a change is this! May, God reward and bless you, both\nin this world and the next!\n\nMay God bless us all! said he. But how does my sweet girl? I have been\nin pain for you--I am sorry I did not apprise you beforehand.\n\nO sir, said I, it was you; and all you do must be good--But this was a\nblessing so unexpected!----\n\nWell, said he, you have given pain to all the company. They will be glad\nto see you, when you can: for you have spoiled all their diversion; and\nyet painfully delighted them at the same time. Mr. Andrews, added he, do\nyou make this house your own; and the longer you stay, the more welcome\nyou'll be. After you have a little composed yourself, my dear girl, step\nin to us again. I am glad to see you so well already. And so he left us.\n\nSee you, my dear father, said I, what goodness there is in this once\nnaughty master! O pray for him! and pray for me, that I may deserve it!\n\nHow long has this happy change been wrought, my dear child?--O, said I,\nseveral happy days!--I have written down every thing; and you'll see,\nfrom the depth of misery, what God has done for your happy daughter!\n\nBlessed be his name! said he. But do you say he will marry you? Can it\nbe, that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a\npoor man as I? O the divine goodness! How will your poor dear mother\nbe able to support these happy tidings? I will set out to-morrow, to\nacquaint her with them: for I am but half happy, till the dear good\nwoman shares them with me!--To be sure, my dear child, we ought to go\ninto some far country to hide ourselves, that we may not disgrace you by\nour poverty!\n\nO, my dear father, said I, now you are unkind for the first time! Your\npoverty has been my glory, and my riches; and I have nothing to brag of,\nbut that I ever thought it an honour, rather than a disgrace; because\nyou were always so honest, that your child might well boast of such a\nparentage!\n\nIn this manner, my dear mother, did we pass the happy moments, till Miss\nDarnford came to me, and said, How do you do, dear madam? I rejoice to\nsee you so well! Pray let us have your company. And yours too, good Mr.\nAndrews, taking his hand.\n\nThis was very obliging, I told her; and we went to the great parlour;\nand my master took my father by the hand, and made him sit down by him,\nand drink a glass of wine with him. Mean-time, I made my excuses to\nthe ladies, as well as I could, which they readily granted me. But Sir\nSimon, after his comical manner, put his hands on my shoulders: Let me\nsee, let me see, said he, where your wings grow; for I never saw any\nbody fly like you.--Why, said he, you have broken Lady Jones's shins\nwith the table. Shew her else, madam.\n\nHis pleasantry made them laugh. And I said, I was very sorry for my\nextravagancy: and if it had not been my master's doings, I should\nhave said, it was a fault to permit me to be surprised, and put out of\nmyself, before such good company. They said, All was very excusable; and\nthey were glad I suffered no more by it.\n\nThey were so kind as to excuse me at cards, and played by themselves;\nand I went by my master's commands and sat on the other side, in the\nhappiest place I ever was blest with, between two of the dearest men in\nthe world to me, and each holding one of my hands:--my father, every now\nand then, with tears, lifting up his eyes, and saying, Could I ever have\nhoped this!\n\nI asked him, If he had been so kind as to bring the papers with him? He\nsaid, He had; and looked at me, as who should say, Must I give them to\nyou now?--I said, Be pleased to let me have them. He pulled them from\nhis pocket; and I stood up, and, with my best duty, gave them into my\nmaster's hands. He said, Thank you, Pamela. Your father shall take all\nwith him, so see what a sad fellow I have been, as well as the present\nhappier alteration. But I must have them all again, for the writer's\nsake.\n\nThe ladies and gentlemen would make me govern the tea-table, whatever I\ncould do; and Abraham attended me, to serve the company. My master and\nmy father sat together, and drank a glass or two of wine instead of tea,\nand Sir Simon joked with my master, saying, I warrant you would not be\nsuch a woman's man, as to drink tea, for ever so much, with the ladies.\nBut your time's coming, and I doubt not you'll be made as comfortable as\nI.\n\nMy master was very urgent with them to stay supper; and at last they\ncomplied, on condition that I would grace the table, as they were\npleased to call it. I begged to be excused. My master said, Don't be\nexcused, Pamela, since the ladies desire it: And besides, said he, we\nwon't part with your father; and so you may as well stay with us.\n\nI was in hopes my father and I might sup by ourselves, or only with Mrs.\nJewkes. And Miss Darnford, who is a most obliging young lady, said, We\nwill not part with you, indeed we won't.\n\nWhen supper was brought in, Lady Darnford took me by the hand, and said\nto my master, Sir, by your leave; and would have placed me at the upper\nend of the table. Pray, pray, madam, said I, excuse me; I cannot do it,\nindeed I cannot. Pamela, said my master, to the great delight of my good\nfather, as I could see by his looks, oblige Lady Darnford, since she\ndesires it. It is but a little before your time, you know.\n\nDear, good sir, said I, pray don't command it! Let me sit by my father,\npray! Why, said Sir Simon, here's ado indeed! Sit down at the upper end,\nas you should do; and your father shall sit by you, there. This put my\ndear father upon difficulties. And my master said, Come, I'll place you\nall: and so put Lady Darnford at the upper end, Lady Jones at her right\nhand, and Mrs. Peters on the other; and he placed me between the two\nyoung ladies; but very genteelly put Miss Darnford below her younger\nsister; saying, Come, miss, I put you here, because you shall hedge in\nthis little cuckow; for I take notice, with pleasure, of your goodness\nto her; and, besides, all you very young ladies should sit together.\nThis seemed to please both sisters; for had the youngest miss been put\nthere, it might have piqued her, as matters have been formerly, to be\nplaced below me; whereas Miss Darnford giving place to her youngest\nsister, made it less odd she should to me; especially with that handsome\nturn of the dear man, as if I was a cuckow, and to be hedged in.\n\nMy master kindly said, Come, Mr. Andrews, you and I will sit together.\nAnd so took his place at the bottom of the table, and set my father\non his right hand; and Sir Simon would sit on his left. For, said he,\nparson, I think the petticoats should sit together; and so do you sit\ndown by that lady (his sister). A boiled turkey standing by me, my\nmaster said, Cut up that turkey, Pamela, if it be not too strong work\nfor you, that Lady Darnford may not have too much trouble. So I carved\nit in a trice, and helped the ladies. Miss Darnford said, I would give\nsomething to be so dexterous a carver. O madam, said I, my late good\nlady would always make me do these things, when she entertained her\nfemale friends, as she used to do on particular days.\n\nAy, said my master, I remember my poor mother would often say, if I, or\nany body at table, happened to be a little out in carving, I'll send up\nfor my Pamela, to shew you how to carve. Said Lady Jones, Mrs. Andrews\nhas every accomplishment of her sex. She is quite wonderful for her\nyears. Miss Darnford said, And I can tell you, madam, that she plays\nsweetly upon the spinnet, and sings as sweetly to it; for she has a fine\nvoice. Foolish! said Sir Simon; who, that hears her speak, knows not\nthat? And who that sees her fingers, believes not that they were made to\ntouch any key? O, parson! said he, 'tis well you're by, or I should have\nhad a blush from the ladies. I hope not, Sir Simon, said Lady Jones; for\na gentleman of your politeness would not say any thing that would make\nladies blush.--No, no, said he, for the world: but if I had, it would\nhave been, as the poet says,\n\n    'They blush, because they understand.'\n\nWhen the company went away, Lady Darnford, Lady Jones, and Mrs. Peters,\nseverally invited my master, and me with him, to their houses; and\nbegged he would permit me, at least, to come before we left those parts.\nAnd they said, We hope, when the happy knot is tied, you will induce Mr.\nB---- to reside more among us. We were always glad, said Lady Darnford,\nwhen he was here; but now shall have double reason. O what grateful\nthings were these to the ears of my good father!\n\nWhen the company was gone, my master asked my father, if he smoked? He\nanswered, No. He made us both sit down by him, and said, I have been\ntelling this sweet girl, that in fourteen days, and two of them are\ngone, she must fix on one to make me happy. And have left it to her\nto choose either one of the first or last seven. My father held up his\nhands, and eyes; God bless your honour! said he, is all I can say. Now,\nPamela, said my master, taking my hand, don't let a little wrong-timed\nbashfulness take place, without any other reason, because I should be\nglad to go to Bedfordshire as soon as I could; and I would not return\ntill I carry my servants there a mistress, who should assist me to\nrepair the mischiefs she has made in it.\n\nI could not look up for confusion. And my father said, My dear child, I\nneed not, I am sure, prompt your obedience in whatever will most oblige\nso good a gentleman. What says my Pamela? said my master: She does not\nuse to be at a loss for expressions. Sir, said I, were I too sudden, it\nwould look as if I doubted whether you would hold in your mind, and was\nnot willing to give you time for reflection: but otherwise, to be sure I\nought to resign myself implicitly to your will. Said he, I want not time\nfor reflection: for I have often told you, and that long ago, I could\nnot live without you: and my pride of condition made me both tempt\nand terrify you to other terms; but your virtue was proof against all\ntemptations, and was not to be awed by terrors: Wherefore, as I could\nnot conquer my passion for you, I corrected myself, and resolved, since\nyou would not be mine upon my terms, you should upon your own: and now I\ndesire you not on any other, I assure you: and I think the sooner it is\ndone, the better. What say you, Mr. Andrews? Sir, said he, there is so\nmuch goodness on your side, and, blessed be God! so much prudence on my\ndaughter's, that I must be quite silent. But when it is done, I and my\npoor wife shall have nothing to do, but to pray for you both, and to\nlook back, with wonder and joy, on the ways of Providence.\n\nThis, said my master, is Friday night; and suppose, my girl, it be next\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday morning?--Say, my Pamela.\n\nWill you, sir, said I, excuse me till to-morrow for an answer? I will,\nsaid he; and touched the bell, and called for Mrs. Jewkes. Where, said\nhe, does Mr. Andrews lie tonight? You'll take care of him. He's a very\ngood man; and will bring a blessing upon every house he sets his foot\nin.\n\nMy dear father wept for joy; and I could not refrain keeping him\ncompany. And my master, saluting me, bid us good night, and retired. And\nI waited upon my dear father, and was so full of prattle, of my master's\ngoodness, and my future prospects, that I believed afterwards I was\nturned all into tongue: but he indulged me, and was transported with\njoy; and went to bed, and dreamed of nothing but Jacob's ladder, and\nangels ascending and descending, to bless him and his daughter.\n\n\nSaturday.\n\nI arose early in the morning; but found my father was up before me, and\nwas gone to walk in the garden. I went to him: and with what delight,\nwith what thankfulness, did we go over every scene of it, that had\nbefore been so dreadful to me! The fish-pond, the back-door, and every\nplace. O what reason had we for thankfulness and gratitude!\n\nAbout seven o'clock my good master joined us, in his morning gown and\nslippers; and looking a little heavy, I said, Sir, I fear you had not\ngood rest last night. That is your fault, Pamela, said he. After I went\nfrom you, I must needs look into your papers, and could not leave them\ntill I had read them through; and so 'twas three o'clock before I went\nto sleep. I wish, sir, said I, you had had better entertainment. The\nworst part of it, said he, was what I had brought upon myself; and\nyou have not spared me. Sir, said I--He interrupting me, said, Well, I\nforgive you. You had too much reason for it. But I find, plainly enough,\nthat if you had got away, you would soon have been Williams's wife: and\nI can't see how it could well have been otherwise. Indeed, sir, said I,\nI had no notion of it, or of being any body's. I believe so, said he;\nbut it must have come as a thing of course; and I see your father was\nfor it. Sir, said he, I little thought of the honour your goodness would\nconfer upon her; and I thought that would be a match above what we\ncould do for her, a great deal. But when I found she was not for it, I\nresolved not to urge her; but leave all to her own prudence.\n\nI see, said he, all was sincere, honest, and open; and I speak of it, if\nit had been done, as a thing that could hardly well be avoided; and I\nam quite satisfied. But, said he, I must observe, as I have a hundred\ntimes, with admiration, what a prodigious memory, and easy and happy\nmanner of narration, this excellent girl has! And though she is full\nof her pretty tricks and artifices, to escape the snares I had laid\nfor her, yet all is innocent, lovely, and uniformly beautiful. You are\nexceedingly happy in a daughter; and I hope I shall be so in a wife--Or,\nsaid my father, may she not have that honour! I fear it not, said he;\nand I hope I shall deserve it of her.\n\nBut, Pamela, said my master, I am sorry to find in some parts of your\njournal, that Mrs. Jewkes carried her orders a little too far: and I\nthe more take notice of it, because you have not complained to me of\nher behaviour, as she might have expected for some parts of it; though a\ngood deal was occasioned by my strict orders.--But she had the insolence\nto strike my girl, I find. Sir, said I, I was a little provoking, I\nbelieve; but as we forgave one another, I was the less entitled to\ncomplain of her.\n\nWell, said he, you are very good; but if you have any particular\nresentment, I will indulge it so far, as that she shall hereafter have\nnothing to do where you are. Sir, said I, you are so kind, that I ought\nto forgive every body; and when I see that my happiness is brought about\nby the very means that I thought then my greatest grievance, I ought to\nbless those means, and forgive all that was disagreeable to me at the\nsame time, for the great good that hath issued from it.--That, said he,\nand kissed me, is sweetly considered! and it shall be my part to make\nyou amends for what you have suffered, that you may still think lighter\nof the one, and have cause to rejoice in the other.\n\nMy dear father's heart was full; and he said, with his hands folded, and\nlifted up, Pray, sir, let me go--let me go--to my dear wife, and tell\nher all these blessed things, while my heart holds; for it is ready to\nburst with joy! Good man! said my master--I hope to hear this honest\nheart of yours speaking at your lips. I enjoin you, Pamela, to continue\nyour relation, as you have opportunity; and though your father be here,\nwrite to your mother, that this wondrous story be perfect, and we, your\nfriends, may read and admire you more and more. Ay, pray, pray do, my\nchild, said my father; and this is the reason that I write on, my dear\nmother, when I thought not to do it, because my father could tell you\nall that passed while he was here.\n\nMy master took notice of my psalm, and was pleased to commend it; and\nsaid, That I had very charitably turned the last verses, which, in the\noriginal, were full of heavy curses, to a wish that shewed I was not of\nan implacable disposition though my then usage might have excused it, if\nI had. But, said he, I think you shall sing it to me to-morrow.\n\nAfter we have breakfasted, added he, if you have no objection, Pamela,\nwe'll take an airing together; and it shall be in the coach, because\nwe'll have your father's company. He would have excused himself; but\nmy master would have it so: but he was much ashamed, because of the\nmeanness of his appearance.\n\nMy master would make us both breakfast with him on chocolate; and he\nsaid, I would have you, Pamela, begin to dress as you used to do; for\nnow, at least, you may call your two other bundles your own; and if you\nwant any thing against the approaching occasion, private as I design\nit, I'll send to Lincoln for it, by a special messenger. I said, My good\nlady's bounty, and his own, had set me much above my degree, and I had\nvery good things of all sorts; and I did not desire any other, because\nI would not excite the censure of the ladies. That would be a different\nthing, he was pleased to say, when he publicly owned his nuptials, after\nwe came to the other house. But, at present, if I was satisfied, he\nwould not make words with me.\n\nI hope, Mr. Andrews, said he, to my father, you'll not leave us till\nyou see the affair over, and then you'll be sure I mean honourably: and,\nbesides, Pamela will be induced to set the day sooner. O, sir, said he,\nI bless God I have no reason to doubt your meaning honourably: and I\nhope you'll excuse me, if I set out on Monday morning, very early, to my\ndear wife, and make her as happy as I am.\n\nWhy, Pamela, says my good master, may it not be performed on Tuesday?\nAnd then your father, maybe, will stay.--I should have been glad to\nhave had it to-morrow, added he; but I have sent Monsieur Colbrand for\na license, that, you may have no scruple unanswered; and he can't very\nwell be back before to-morrow night, or Monday morning.\n\nThis was most agreeable news. I said, Sir, I know my dear father will\nwant to be at home: and as you was so good to give me a fortnight from\nlast Thursday, I should be glad you would be pleased to indulge me still\nto some day in the second seven.\n\nWell, said he, I will not be too urgent; but the sooner you fix,\nthe better. Mr. Andrews, we must leave something to these Jephthah's\ndaughters, in these cases, he was pleased to say: I suppose the little\nbashful folly, which, in the happiest circumstances, may give a kind of\nregret to quit the maiden state, and an awkwardness at the entrance into\na new one, is a reason with Pamela; and so she shall name her day. Sir,\nsaid he, you are all goodness.\n\nI went up soon after, and new dressed myself, taking possession, in a\nhappy moment, I hope, of my two bundles, as my good master was pleased\nto call them; (alluding to my former division of those good things\nmy lady and himself bestowed upon me;) and so put on fine linen, silk\nshoes, and fine white cotton stockings, a fine quilted coat, a delicate\ngreen Mantea silk gown and coat, a French necklace, and a laced cambric\nhandkerchief, and clean gloves; and, taking my fan in my hand, I, like\na little proud hussy, looked in the glass, and thought myself a\ngentlewoman once more; but I forgot not to return due thanks, for being\nable to put on this dress with so much comfort.\n\nMrs. Jewkes would help to dress me, and complimented me highly, saying,\namong other things, That now I looked like a lady indeed: and as, she\nsaid, the little chapel was ready, and divine service would be read in\nit to-morrow, she wished the happy knot might then be tied. Said she,\nHave you not seen the chapel, madam, since it has been cleaned out? No,\nsaid I; but are we to have service in it to-morrow, do you say?--I am\nglad of that; for I have been a sad heathen lately, sore against my\nwill!--But who is to officiate?--Somebody, replied she, Mr. Peters will\nsend. You tell me very good news, said I, Mrs. Jewkes: I hope it will\nnever be a lumber-room again.--Ay, said she, I can tell you more good\nnews; for the two Misses Darnford, and Lady Jones, are to be here at the\nopening of it; and will stay and dine with you. My master, said I, has\nnot told me that. You must alter your style, madam, said she: It must\nnot be master now, sure!--O, returned I, this is a language I shall\nnever forget: he shall always be my master; and I shall think myself\nmore and more his servant.\n\nMy poor father did not know I went up to dress myself; and he said his\nheart misgave him when he saw me first, for fear I was made a fool of,\nand that here was some fine lady that was to be my master's true wife.\nAnd he stood in admiration, and said, O, my dear child, how well will\nyou become your happy condition! Why you look like a lady already! I\nhope, my dear father, said I, and boldly kissed him, I shall always be\nyour dutiful daughter, whatever my condition be.\n\nMy master sent me word he was ready; and when he saw me, said, Dress as\nyou will, Pamela, you're a charming girl! and so handed me to the\ncoach, and would make my father and me sit both on the foreside, and sat\nbackwards, over against me; and bid the coachman drive to the meadow;\nthat is, where he once met Mr. Williams.\n\nThe conversation was most agreeable to me, and to my dear father, as\nwe went; and he more and more exceeded in goodness and generosity; and,\nwhile I was gone up to dress, he had presented my father with twenty\nguineas; desiring him to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they\nshould think proper; and lay it all out: but I knew not this till after\nwe came home; my father having had no opportunity to tell me of it.\n\nHe was pleased to inform me of the chapel being got in tolerable order;\nand said, it looked very well; and against he came down next, it should\nbe all new white-washed, and painted and lined; and a new pulpit-cloth,\ncushion, desk, etc. and that it should always be kept in order for the\nfuture. He told me the two Misses Darnford, and Lady Jones, would dine\nwith him on Sunday: And, with their servants and mine, said he, we shall\nmake a tolerable congregation. And, added he, have I not well contrived\nto shew you that the chapel is really a little house of God, and has\nbeen consecrated, before we solemnize our nuptials in it?--O, sir,\nreplied I, your goodness to me is inexpressible! Mr. Peters, said he,\noffered to come and officiate in it; but would not stay to dine with\nme, because he has company at his own house: and so I intend that divine\nservice shall be performed in it by one to whom I shall make some yearly\nallowance, as a sort of chaplain.--You look serious, Pamela, added he:\nI know you think of your friend Williams. Indeed, sir, said I, if you\nwon't be angry, I did. Poor man! I am sorry I have been the cause of his\ndisobliging you.\n\nWhen we came to the meadow, where the gentry have their walk sometimes,\nthe coach stopt, and my master alighted, and led me to the brook-side,\nand it is a very pretty summer walk. He asked my father, If he chose to\nwalk out, or go on in the coach to the farther end? He, poor man, chose\nto go on in the coach, for fear, he said, any gentry should be walking\nthere; and he told me, he was most of the way upon his knees in the\ncoach, thanking God for his gracious mercies and goodness; and begging a\nblessing upon my good master and me.\n\nI was quite astonished, when we came into the shady walk, to see Mr.\nWilliams there. See there, said my master, there's poor Williams,\ntaking his solitary walk again, with his book. And, it seems, it was so\ncontrived; for Mr. Peters had been, as I since find, desired to tell him\nto be in that walk at such an hour in the morning.\n\nSo, old acquaintance, said my master, again have I met you in this\nplace? What book are you now reading? He said, it was Boileau's Lutrin.\nSaid my master, You see I have brought with me my little fugitive,\nthat would have been: While you are perfecting yourself in French, I am\ntrying to learn English; and hope soon to be master of it.\n\nMine, sir, said he, is a very beautiful piece of French: but your\nEnglish has no equal.\n\nYou are very polite, Mr. Williams, said my master: And he that does not\nthink as you do, deserves no share in her. Why, Pamela, added he, very\ngenerously, why so strange, where you have once been so familiar? I\ndo assure you both, that I mean not, by this interview, to insult Mr.\nWilliams, or confound you. Then I said, Mr. Williams, I am very glad\nto see you well; and though the generous favour of my good master has\nhappily changed the scene, since you and I last saw one another, I am\nnevertheless very glad of an opportunity to acknowledge, with gratitude,\nyour good intentions, not so much to serve me, as me, but as a\nperson--that then had great reason to believe herself in distress. And\nI hope, sir, added I, to my master, your goodness will permit me to say\nthis.\n\nYou, Pamela, said he, may make what acknowledgments you please to Mr.\nWilliams's good intentions; and I would have you speak as you think;\nbut I do not apprehend myself to be quite so much obliged to those\nintentions.\n\nSir, said Mr. Williams, I beg leave to say, I knew well, that, by\neducation, you was no libertine; nor had I reason to think you so by\ninclination; and, when you came to reflect, I hoped you would not be\ndispleased with me. And this was no small motive to me, at first, to do\nas I did.\n\nAy, but Mr. Williams, said my master, could you think I should have had\nreason to thank you, if, loving one person above all her sex, you had\nrobbed me of her, and married her yourself?--And then, said he, you are\nto consider, that she was an old acquaintance of mine, and a quite\nnew one to you; that I had sent her down to my own house, for better\nsecuring her; and that you, who had access to my house, could not effect\nyour purpose, without being guilty, in some sort, of a breach of the\nlaws of hospitality and friendship. As to my designs upon her, I own\nthey had not the best appearance; but still I was not answerable to Mr.\nWilliams for those; much less could you be excused to invade a property\nso very dear to me, and to endeavour to gain an interest in her\naffections, when you could not be certain that matters would not turn\nout as they have actually done.\n\nI own, said he, that some parts of my conduct seem exceptionable, as\nyou state it. But, sir, I am but a young man. I meant no harm. I had no\ninterest, I am sure, to incur your displeasure; and when you think of\nevery thing, and the inimitable graces of person, and perfections of\nmind, that adorn this excellent lady, (so he called me,) you will,\nperhaps, find your generosity allow something as an extenuation of a\nfault, which your anger would not permit as an excuse.\n\nI have done, said my master; nor did I meet you here to be angry with\nyou. Pamela knew not that she should see you: and now you are both\npresent, I would ask you, Mr. Williams, If, now you know my honourable\ndesigns towards this good girl, you can really be almost, I will not say\nquite, as well pleased with the friendship of my wife, as you could be\nwith the favour of Mrs. Andrews?\n\nSir, said he, I will answer you truly. I think I could have preferred,\nwith her, any condition that could have befallen me, had I considered\nonly myself. But, sir, I was very far from having any encouragement to\nexpect her favour; and I had much more reason to believe, that, if she\ncould have hoped for your goodness, her heart would have been too much\npre-engaged to think of any body else. And give me leave further to\nsay, sir, that, though I tell you sincerely my thoughts, were I only to\nconsider myself; yet, when I consider her good, and her merit, I should\nbe highly ungenerous, were it put to my choice, if I could not wish her\nin a condition so much superior to what I could raise her to, and so\nvery answerable to her merit.\n\nPamela, said my master, you are obliged to Mr. Williams, and ought to\nthank him: He has distinguished well. But, as for me, who had like to\nhave lost you by his means, I am glad the matter was not left to his\nchoice. Mr. Williams, added he, I give you Pamela's hand, because I know\nit will be pleasing to her, in token of her friendship and esteem for\nyou; and I give you mine, that I will not be your enemy: but yet I must\nsay, that I think I owe this proper manner of your thinking more to your\ndisappointment, than to the generosity you talk of.\n\nMr. Williams kissed my hand, as my master gave it him; and my master\nsaid, Sir, you will go home and dine with me, and I'll shew you my\nlittle chapel; and do you, Pamela, look upon yourself at liberty to\nnumber Mr. Williams in the list of your friends.\n\nHow generous, how noble, was this! Mr. Williams (and so had I) had tears\nof pleasure in his eyes. I was silent: But Mr. Williams said, Sir, I\nshall be taught, by your generosity, to think myself inexcusably wrong,\nin every step I took, that could give you offence; and my future life\nshall shew my respectful gratitude.\n\nWe walked on till we came to the coach, where was my dear father.\nPamela, said my master, tell Mr. Williams who that good man is. O, Mr.\nWilliams! said I, it is my dear father! and my master was pleased to\nsay, One of the honestest men in England: Pamela owes every thing that\nshe is to be, as well as her being, to him; for, I think, she would not\nhave brought me to this, nor made so great resistance, but for the good\nlessons, and religious education, she had imbibed from him.\n\nMr. Williams said, taking father's hand, You see, good Mr. Andrews, with\ninexpressible pleasure, no doubt, the fruits of your pious care; and now\nare in a way, with your beloved daughter, to reap the happy effects of\nit.--I am overcome, said my dear father, with his honour's goodness: But\nI can only say, I bless God, and bless him.\n\nMr. Williams and I being nearer the coach than my master, and he\noffering to draw back, to give way to him, he kindly said, Pray, Mr.\nWilliams, oblige Pamela with your hand; and step in yourself. He bowed,\nand took my hand; and my master made him step in, and sit next me, all\nthat ever he could do; and sat himself over against him, next my father,\nwho sat against me.\n\nAnd he said, Mr. Andrews, I told you yesterday that the divine you saw\nwas not Mr. Williams; I now tell you, this gentleman is: and though I\nhave been telling him, I think not myself obliged to his intentions; yet\nI will own that Pamela and you are; and though I won't promise to love\nhim, I would have you.\n\nSir, said Mr. Williams, you have a way of overcoming, that hardly all\nmy reading affords an instance of; and it is the more noble, as it is\non this side, as I presume, the happy ceremony, which, great as your\nfortune is, will lay you under an obligation to so much virtue and\nbeauty, when the lady becomes yours; for you will then have a treasure\nthat princes might envy you.\n\nSaid my generous master, (God bless him!) Mr. Williams, it is impossible\nthat you and I should long live at variance, when our sentiments agree\nso well together, on subjects the most material.\n\nI was quite confounded; and my master, seeing it, took my hand, and\nsaid, Look up, my good girl; and collect yourself.--Don't injure Mr.\nWilliams and me so much, as to think we are capping compliments, as we\nused to do verses at school. I dare answer for us both, that we say not\na syllable we don't think.\n\nO sir, said I, how unequal am I to all this goodness! Every moment that\npasses adds to the weight of the obligations you oppress me with.\n\nThink not too much of that, said he most generously. Mr. Williams's\ncompliments to you have great advantage of mine: For, though equally\nsincere, I have a great deal to say, and to do, to compensate the\nsufferings I have made you undergo; and, at last, must sit down\ndissatisfied, because those will never be balanced by all I can do for\nyou.\n\nHe saw my dear father quite unable to support these affecting instances\nof his goodness;--and he let go my hand, and took his; and said, seeing\nhis tears, I wonder not, my dear Pamela's father, that your honest heart\nsprings thus to your eyes, to see all her trials at an end. I will not\npretend to say, that I had formerly either power or will to act thus:\nBut since I began to resolve on the change you see, I have reaped so\nmuch pleasure in it, that my own interest will keep me steady: For, till\nwithin these few days, I knew not what it was to be happy.\n\nPoor Mr. Williams, with tears of joy in his eyes, said, How happily,\nsir, have you been touched by the divine grace, before you have been\nhurried into the commission of sins, that the deepest penitence could\nhardly have atoned for!--God has enabled you to stop short of the evil;\nand you have nothing to do, but to rejoice in the good, which now\nwill be doubly so, because you can receive it without the least inward\nreproach.\n\nYou do well, said he, to remind me, that I owe all this to the grace\nof God. I bless Him for it; and I thank this good man for his excellent\nlessons to his daughter; I thank her for following them: and I hope,\nfrom her good example, and your friendship, Mr. Williams, in time, to\nbe half as good as my tutoress: and that, said he, I believe you'll own,\nwill make me, without disparagement to any man, the best fox-hunter in\nEngland.--Mr. Williams was going to speak: and he said, You put on so\ngrave a look, Mr. Williams, that, I believe, what I have said, with you\npractical good folks, is liable to exception: but I see we are become\nquite grave; and we must not be too serious neither.\n\nWhat a happy creature, my dear mother, is your Pamela!--O may my\nthankful heart, and the good use I may be enabled to make of the\nblessings before me, be a means to continue this delightful prospect to\na long date, for the sake of the dear good gentleman, who thus becomes\nthe happy instrument, in the hand of Providence, to bless all he smiles\nupon! To be sure, I shall never enough acknowledge the value he is\npleased to express for my unworthiness, in that he has prevented my\nwishes, and, unasked, sought the occasion of being reconciled to a good\nman, who, for my sake, had incurred his displeasure; and whose name he\ncould not, a few days before, permit to pass through my lips! But see\nthe wonderful ways of Providence! The very things that I most dreaded\nhis seeing or knowing, the contents of my papers, have, as I hope,\nsatisfied all his scruples, and been a means to promote my happiness.\n\nHenceforth let not us poor short-sighted mortals pretend to rely on\nour own wisdom; or vainly think, that we are absolutely to direct for\nourselves. I have abundant reason, I am sure, to say, that, when I was\nmost disappointed, I was nearer my happiness: for had I made my escape,\nwhich was so often my chief point in view, and what I had placed my\nheart upon, I had escaped the blessings now before me, and fallen,\nperhaps headlong, into the miseries I would have avoided. And yet, after\nall, it was necessary I should take the steps I did, to bring on this\nwonderful turn: O the unsearchable wisdom of God!--And how much ought\nI to adore the divine goodness, and humble myself, who am made a poor\ninstrument, as I hope, not only to magnify his graciousness to this fine\ngentleman and myself, but also to dispense benefits to others! Which God\nof his mercy grant!\n\n\nIn the agreeable manner I have mentioned, did we pass the time in our\nsecond happy tour; and I thought Mrs. Jewkes would have sunk into the\nground, when she saw Mr. Williams brought in the coach with us, and\ntreated so kindly. We dined together in a most pleasant, easy, and frank\nmanner; and I found I need not, from my master's generosity, to be under\nany restraint, as to my conduct to this good clergyman: For he, so often\nas he fancied I was reserved, moved me to be free with him, and to him;\nand several times called upon me to help my father and Mr. Williams; and\nseemed to take great delight in seeing me carve, as, indeed, he does in\nevery thing I do.\n\nAfter dinner we went and looked into the chapel, which is a very pretty\none, and very decent; and, when finished as he designs it, against his\nnext coming down, will be a very pretty place.\n\nMy heart, my dear mother, when I first set my foot in it, throbbed a\ngood deal, with awful joy, at the thoughts of the solemnity, which, I\nhope, will in a few days be performed here. And when I came up\ntowards the little pretty altar-piece, while they were looking at a\ncommunion-picture, and saying it was prettily done, I gently stept into\na corner, out of sight, and poured out my soul to God on my knees, in\nsupplication and thankfulness, that, after having been so long absent\nfrom divine service, the first time I entered into a house dedicated to\nhis honour, should be with such blessed prospects before me; and\nbegging of God to continue me humble, and to make me not unworthy of\nhis mercies; and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my\nhappiness, my good master.\n\nI heard my master say, Where's Pamela? And so I broke off sooner than I\nwould, and went up to him.\n\nHe said, Mr. Williams, I hope I have not so offended you by my conduct\npast, (for really it is what I ought to be ashamed of,) as that you will\nrefuse to officiate, and to give us your instructions here to-morrow.\nMr. Peters was so kind, for the first time, to offer it; but I knew it\nwould be inconvenient for him; and, besides, I was willing to make this\nrequest to you an introduction to our reconciliation.\n\nSir, said he, most willingly, and most gratefully, will I obey you:\nThough, if you expect a discourse, I am wholly unprepared for the\noccasion. I would not have it, replied he, pointed to any particular\noccasion; but if you have one upon the text--There is more joy in Heaven\nover one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-nine just persons that\nneed no repentance; and if it makes me not such a sad fellow as to be\npointed at by mine and the ladies' servants we shall have here, I shall\nbe well content. 'Tis a general subject, added he, makes me speak of\nthat; but any one you please will do; for you cannot make a bad choice,\nI am sure.\n\nSir, said he, I have one upon that text; but I am ready to think, that\na thanksgiving one, which I made on a great mercy to myself, if I may be\npermitted to make my own acknowledgments of your favour the subject of\na discourse, will be suitable to my grateful sentiments. It is on the\ntext;--Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have\nseen thy salvation.\n\nThat text, said I, will be a very suitable one for me. Not so, Pamela,\nsaid my master; because I don't let you depart in peace; but I hope you\nwill stay here with content.\n\nO but, sir, said I, I have seen God's salvation!--I am sure, added I,\nif any body ever had reason, I have to say, with the blessed virgin, My\nsoul doth magnify the Lord; for he hath regarded the low estate of his\nhandmaiden--and exalted one of low degree.\n\nSaid my good father, I am sure, if there were time for it, the book of\nRuth would afford a fine subject for the honour done my dear child.\n\nWhy, good Mr. Andrews, said my master, should you say so?--I know that\nstory, and Mr. Williams will confirm what I say, that my good girl here\nwill confer at least as much honour as she will receive.\n\nSir, said I, you are inexpressibly generous; but I shall never think so.\nWhy, my Pamela, said he, that's another thing: It will be best for me to\nthink you will; and it will be kind in you to think you shan't; and then\nwe shall always have an excellent rule to regulate our conduct by to one\nanother.\n\nWas not this finely, nobly, wisely said, my dear mother?--O what a\nblessed thing it is to be matched to a man of sense and generosity!--How\nedifying! How!--But what shall I say?--I am at loss for words.\n\nMr. Williams said, when we came out of the little chapel, He would go\nhome, and look over his discourses, for one for the next day. My master\nsaid, I have one thing to say before you go--When my jealousy, on\naccount of this good girl, put me upon such a vindictive conduct to you,\nyou know I took a bond for the money I had caused you to be troubled\nfor: I really am ashamed of the matter; because I never intended, when\nI presented it to you, to have it again, you may be sure: But I knew not\nwhat might happen between you and her, nor how far matters might have\ngone between you; and so I was willing to have that in awe over you. And\nI think it is no extraordinary present, therefore, to give you up your\nbond again cancelled. And so he took it from his pocket, and gave it\nhim. I think, added he, all the charges attending it, and the trouble\nyou had, were defrayed by my attorney; I ordered that they should. They\nwere, sir, said he; and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness,\nand the kind manner in which you do it.--If you will go, Mr. Williams,\nsaid he, shall my chariot carry you home? No, sir, answered he, I thank\nyou. My time will be so well employed all the way, in thinking of your\nfavours, that I choose to meditate upon them, as I walk home.\n\nMy dear father was a little uneasy about his habit, for appearing at\nchapel next day, because of Misses Darnford and the servants, for fear,\npoor man, he should disgrace my master; and he told me, when he was\nmentioning this, of my master's kind present of twenty guineas for\nclothes, for you both; which made my heart truly joyful. But oh! to be\nsure, I can never deserve the hundredth part of his goodness!--It is\nalmost a hard thing to be under the weight of such deep obligations on\none side, and such a sense of one's own unworthiness on the other.--O!\nwhat a Godlike power is that of doing good!--I envy the rich and the\ngreat for nothing else.\n\nMy master coming to us just then, I said, Oh! sir, will your bounty\nknow no limits? My dear father has told me what you have given him.--A\ntrifle, Pamela, said he, a little earnest only of my kindness.--Say\nno more of it. But did I not hear the good man expressing some sort of\nconcern for somewhat? Hide nothing from me, Pamela. Only, sir, said I,\nhe knew not how to absent himself from divine service, and yet is afraid\nof disgracing you by appearing.\n\nFie, Mr. Andrews! said he, I thought you knew that the outward\nappearance was nothing. I wish I had as good a habit inwardly as you\nhave. But I'll tell you, Pamela, your father is not so much thinner than\nI am, nor much shorter; he and I will walk up together to my wardrobe;\nthough it is not so well stored here, as in Bedfordshire.\n\nAnd so, said he, pleasantly, don't you pretend to come near us, till\nI call for you; for you must not yet see how men dress and undress\nthemselves. O sir, said my father, I beg to be excused. I am sorry you\nwere told. So am not I, said my master: Pray come along with me.\n\nHe carried him up stairs, and shewed him several suits, and would have\nhad him take his choice. My poor father was quite confounded: for my\nmaster saw not any he thought too good, and my father none that he\nthought bad enough. And my good master, at last, (he fixed his eye upon\na fine drab, which he thought looked the plainest,) would help him to\ntry the coat and waistcoat on himself; and, indeed, one would not\nhave thought it, because my master is taller, and rather plumper, as I\nthought but, as I saw afterwards, they fitted him very well. And being\nplain, and lined with the same colour, and made for travelling in a\ncoach, pleased my poor father much. He gave him the whole suit, and,\ncalling up Mrs. Jewkes, said, Let these clothes be well aired against\ntomorrow morning. Mr. Andrews brought only with him his common apparel,\nnot thinking to stay Sunday with us. And pray see for some of my\nstockings, and whether any of my shoes will fit him: And see also for\nsome of my linen; for we have put the good man quite out of his course,\nby keeping him Sunday over. He was then pleased to give him the silver\nbuckles out of his own shoes. So, my good mother, you must expect to see\nmy dear father a great beau. Wig, said my master, he wants none; for\nhis own venerable white locks are better than all the perukes in\nEngland.--But I am sure I have hats enough somewhere.--I'll take care of\nevery thing, sir, said Mrs. Jewkes.--And my poor father, when he came to\nme, could not refrain tears. I know not how, said he, to comport myself\nunder these great favours. O my child, it is all owing to the divine\ngoodness, and your virtue.\n\n\nSunday.\n\nThis blessed day all the family seemed to take delight to equip\nthemselves for the celebration of the Sabbath in the little chapel;\nand Lady Jones and Mr. Williams came in her chariot, and the two Misses\nDarnford in their own. And we breakfasted together in a most agreeable\nmanner. My dear father appeared quite spruce and neat, and was quite\ncaressed by the three ladies. As we were at breakfast, my master told\nMr. Williams, We must let the Psalms alone, he doubted, for want of\na clerk: but Mr. Williams said, No, nothing should be wanting that he\ncould supply. My father said, If it might be permitted him, he would, as\nwell as he was able, perform that office; for it was always what he had\ntaken delight in. And as I knew he had learnt psalmody formerly, in his\nyouth, and had constantly practised it in private, at home, on Sunday\nevenings, (as well as endeavoured to teach it in the little school he\nso unsuccessfully set up, at the beginning of his misfortunes, before\nhe took to hard labour,) I was in no pain for his undertaking it in this\nlittle congregation. They seemed much pleased with this; and so we went\nto chapel, and made a pretty tolerable appearance; Mrs. Jewkes, and all\nthe servants, attending, but the cook: And I never saw divine service\nperformed with more solemnity, nor assisted at with greater devotion\nand decency; my master, Lady Jones, and the two misses, setting a lovely\nexample.\n\nMy good father performed his part with great applause, making the\nresponses, as if he had been a practised parish-clerk; and giving the\nxxiiid psalm,\n\n    [The Lord is only my support,\n       And he that doth me feed:\n     How can I then lack any thing\n       Whereof I stand in need?\n     In pastures green he feedeth me,\n       Where I do safely lie;\n     And after leads me to the streams,\n       Which run most pleasantly.\n\n     And when I find myself near lost,\n       Then home he doth me take;\n     Conducting me in his right paths,\n       E'en for his own name's sake.\n     And tho' I were e'en at death's door,\n       Yet would I fear no ill:\n     For both thy rod and shepherd's crook\n       Afford me comfort still.\n\n     Thou hast my table richly spread\n       In presence of my foe:\n     Thou hast my head with balm refresh'd,\n       My cup doth overflow.\n     And finally, while breath doth last,\n       Thy grace shall me defend:\n     And in the house of God will I\n       My life for ever spend.]\n\nwhich consisted of but three staves, we had it all; and he read the\nline, and began the tune with a heart so entirely affected with the\nduty, that he went through it distinctly, calmly, and fervently at the\nsame time; so that Lady Jones whispered me, That good man were fit for\nall companies, and present to every laudable occasion: And Miss Darnford\nsaid, God bless the dear good man!--You must think how I rejoiced in my\nmind.\n\nI know, my dear mother, you can say most of the shortest psalms by\nheart; so I need not transcribe it, especially as your chief treasure is\na bible; and a worthy treasure it is. I know nobody makes more or better\nuse of it.\n\nMr. Williams gave us an excellent discourse on liberality and\ngenerosity, and the blessings attending the right use of riches, from\nthe xith chapter of Proverbs, ver. 24, 25. There is that scattereth, and\nyet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but\nit tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat: And he that\nwatereth, shall be watered also himself. And he treated the subject\nin so handsome a manner, that my master's delicacy, who, at first, was\nafraid of some personal compliments, was not offended. Mr. Williams\njudiciously keeping to generals; and it was an elegant and sensible\ndiscourse, as my master said.\n\nMy father was in the clerk's place, just under the desk; and Lady Jones,\nby her footman, whispered him to favour us with another psalm, when the\nsermon was ended. He thinking, as he said afterwards, that the former\nwas rather of the longest, chose the shortest in the book, which you\nknow is the cxviith.\n\n    [O all ye nations of the world,\n       Praise ye the Lord always:\n     And all ye people every where\n       Set forth his noble praise.\n\n     For great his kindness is to us;\n       His truth doth not decay:\n     Wherefore praise ye the Lord our God;\n       Praise ye the Lord alway.]\n\nMy master thanked Mr. Williams for his excellent discourse, and so did\nthe ladies; as also did I most heartily: and he was pleased to take my\ndear father by the hand, as did also Mr. Williams, and thanked him.\nThe ladies, likewise, made him their compliments; and the servants all\nlooked upon him with countenances of respect and pleasure.\n\nAt dinner, do what I could, I was forced to take the upper end of the\ntable; and my master sat at the lower end, between Mr. Williams and my\nfather. And he said, Pamela, you are so dexterous, that I think you may\nhelp the ladies yourself; and I will help my two good friends. I should\nhave told you, though, that I dressed myself in a flowered satin, that\nwas my lady's, and looked quite fresh and good, and which was given me,\nat first, by my master; and the ladies, who had not seen me out of my\nhomespun before, made me abundance of fine compliments, as soon as they\nsaw me first.\n\nTalking of the Psalms just after dinner, my master was very naughty,\nif I may so say: For he said to my father, Mr. Andrews, I think in the\nafternoon, as we shall have only prayers, we may have one longer psalm;\nand what think you of the cxxxviith? O, good sir! said I, pray, pray,\nnot a word more! Say what you will, Pamela, said he, you shall sing it\nto us, according to your on version, before these good ladies go away.\nMy father smiled, but was half concerned for me; and said, Will it bear,\nand please your honour?--O ay, said he, never fear it; so long as Mrs.\nJewkes is not in the hearing.\n\nThis excited all the ladies' curiosity; and Lady Jones said, She would\nbe loath to desire to hear any thing that would give me concern; but\nshould be glad I would give leave for it. Indeed, madam, said I, I\nmust beg you won't insist upon it. I cannot bear it.--You shall see\nit, indeed, ladies, said my master; and pray, Pamela, not always as\nyou please, neither.--Then, pray sir, said I, not in my hearing, I\nhope.--Sure, Pamela, returned he, you would not write what is not fit\nto be heard!--But, sir, said I, there are particular cases, times, and\noccasions, that may make a thing passable at one time, that would not be\ntolerable at another. O, said he, let me judge of that, as well as you,\nPamela. These ladies know a good part of your story; and, let me tell\nyou, what they know is more to your credit than mine; so that if I have\nno averseness to reviving the occasion, you may very well bear it. Said\nhe, I will put you out of your pain, Pamela: here it is: and took it out\nof his pocket.\n\nI stood up, and said, Indeed, sir, I can't bear it; I hope you'll allow\nme to leave the room a minute, if you will read it. Indeed but I won't,\nanswered he. Lady Jones said, Pray, good sir, don't let us hear it, if\nMrs. Andrews be so unwilling. Well, Pamela, said my master, I will put\nit to your choice, whether I shall read it now, or you will sing it by\nand by. That's very hard, sir, said I. It must be one, I assure you,\nsaid he. Why then, sir, replied I, you must do as you please; for I\ncannot sing it.\n\nWell, then, said my master, I find I must read it; and yet, added he,\nafter all, I had as well let it alone, for it is no great reputation to\nmyself. O then, said Miss Darnford, pray let us hear it, to choose.\n\nWhy then, proceeded he, the case was this: Pamela, I find, when she was\nin the time of her confinement, (that is, added he, when she was\ntaken prisoner, in order to make me one; for that is the upshot of\nthe matter,) in the journal she kept, which was intended for nobody's\nperusal but her parents, tells them, that she was importuned, one\nSunday, by Mrs. Jewkes, to sing a psalm; but her spirits not permitting,\nshe declined it: But after Mrs. Jewkes was gone down, she says, she\nrecollected, that the cxxxviith psalm was applicable to her own case;\nMrs. Jewkes having often, on other days, in vain, besought her to sing\na song: That thereupon she turned it more to her own supposed case; and\nbelieving Mrs. Jewkes had a design against her honour, and looking upon\nher as her gaoler, she thus gives her version of this psalm. But pray,\nMr. Williams, do you read one verse of the common translation, and I\nwill read one of Pamela's. Then Mr. Williams, pulling out his little\npocket Common-Prayer-Book, read the first two stanzas:\n\n                 I.\n\n    When we did sit in Babylon,\n      The rivers round about;\n    Then in remembrance of Sion,\n      The tears for grief burst out.\n\n                II.\n\n    We hang'd our harps and instruments\n      The willow trees upon:\n    For in that place, men, for that use,\n      Had planted many a one.\n\nMy master then read:\n\n                 I.\n\n    When sad I sat in B----n-hall,\n      All guarded round about,\n    And thought of ev'ry absent friend,\n      The tears for grief burst out.\n\n                II.\n\n    My joys and hopes all overthrown,\n      My heart-strings almost broke,\n    Unfit my mind for melody,\n      Much more to bear a joke.\n\nThe ladies said, It was very pretty; and Miss Darnford, That somebody\nelse had more need to be concerned than the versifier.\n\nI knew, said my master, I should get no credit by shewing this. But let\nus read on, Mr. Williams. So Mr. Williams read:\n\n               III.\n\n    Then they, to whom we pris'ners were,\n      Said to us, tauntingly,\n    Now let us hear your Hebrew songs,\n      And pleasant melody.\n\nNow this, said my master, is very near; and read:\n\n               III.\n\n    Then she, to whom I prisoner was,\n      Said to me tauntingly,\n    Now cheer your heart, and sing a song,\n      And tune your mind to joy.\n\nMighty sweet, said Mr. Williams. But let us see how the next verse is\nturned. It is this:\n\n                IV.\n\n    Alas! said we; who can once frame\n      His heavy heart to sing\n    The praises of our living God,\n      Thus under a strange king?\n\nWhy, said my master, it is turned with beautiful simplicity, thus:\n\n                IV.\n\n    Alas! said I, how can I frame\n      My heavy heart to sing,\n    Or tune my mind, while thus enthrall'd\n      By such a wicked thing?\n\nVery pretty, said Mr. Williams. Lady Jones said, O, dear madam! could\nyou wish that we should be deprived of this new instance of your genius\nand accomplishments?\n\nO! said my dear father, you will make my good child proud. No, said my\nmaster very generously, Pamela can't be proud. For no one is proud to\nhear themselves praised, but those who are not used to it.--But proceed,\nMr. Williams. He read:\n\n                 V.\n\n    But yet, if I Jerusalem\n      Out of my heart let slide;\n    Then let my fingers quite forget\n      The warbling harp to guide.\n\nWell, now, said my master, for Pamela's version:\n\n                 V.\n\n    But yet, if from my innocence\n      I ev'n in thought should slide,\n    Then let my fingers quite forget\n      The sweet spinnet to guide.\n\nMr. Williams read:\n\n                VI.\n\n    And let my tongue, within my mouth,\n      Be ty'd for ever fast,\n    If I rejoice, before I see\n      Thy full deliv'rance past.\n\nThis, also, said my master, is very near:\n\n                VI.\n\n    And let my tongue, within my mouth,\n      Be lock'd for ever fast,\n    If I rejoice, before I see\n      My full deliv'rance past.\n\nNow, good sir, said I, oblige me; don't read any further: pray don't! O\npray, madam, said Mr. Williams, let me beg to have the rest read; for\nI long to know whom you make the Sons of Edom, and how you turn the\nPsalmist's execrations against the insulting Babylonians.\n\nWell, Mr. Williams, replied I, you should not have said so. O, said my\nmaster, that is one of the best things of all. Poor Mrs. Jewkes stands\nfor Edom's Sons; and we must not lose this, because I think it one of\nmy Pamela's excellencies, that, though thus oppressed, she prays for\nno harm upon the oppressor. Read, Mr. Williams, the next stanza. So he\nread:\n\n               VII.\n\n    Therefore, O Lord! remember now\n      The cursed noise and cry,\n    That Edom's sons against us made,\n      When they ras'd our city.\n\n              VIII.\n\n    Remember, Lord, their cruel words,\n      When, with a mighty sound,\n    They cried, Down, yea down with it,\n      Unto the very ground!\n\nWell, said my master, here seems, in what I am going to read, a little\nbit of a curse indeed, but I think it makes no ill figure in the\ncomparison.\n\n               VII.\n\n    And thou, Almighty! recompense\n      The evils I endure\n    From those who seek my sad disgrace,\n      So causeless, to procure.\n\nAnd now, said he, for Edom's Sons. Though a little severe in the\nimputation.\n\n              VIII.\n\n    Remember, Lord, this Mrs. Jewkes,\n      When with a mighty sound,\n    She cries, Down with her chastity,\n      Down to the very ground!\n\nSure, sir, said I, this might have been spared! But the ladies and Mr.\nWilliams said, No, by no means! And I see the poor wicked woman has no\nfavourers among them.\n\nNow, said my master, read the Psalmist's heavy curses: and Mr. Williams\nread:\n\n                IX.\n\n    Ev'n so shalt thou, O Babylon!\n      At length to dust be brought:\n    And happy shall that man be call'd,\n      That our revenge hath wrought.\n\n                 X.\n\n    Yea, blessed shall the man be call'd\n      That takes thy little ones,\n    And dasheth them in pieces small\n      Against the very stones.\n\nThus he said, very kindly, has my Pamela turned these lines:\n\n                IX.\n\n    Ev'n so shalt thou, O wicked one!\n      At length to shame be brought;\n    And happy shall all those be call'd,\n      That my deliv'rance wrought.\n\n                 X.\n\n    Yea, blessed shall the man be call'd\n      That shames thee of thy evil,\n    And saves me from thy vile attempts,\n      And thee, too, from the d---l.\n\n\nI fancy this blessed man, said my master smiling, was, at that time,\nhoped to be you, Mr. Williams, if the truth was known. Sir, said he,\nwhoever it was intended for then, it can be nobody but your good self\nnow.\n\nI could hardly hold up my head for the praises the kind ladies were\npleased to heap upon me. I am sure, by this, they are very partial in\nmy favour; all because my master is so good to me, and loves to hear me\npraised; for I see no such excellence in these lines, as they would make\nme believe, besides what is borrowed from the Psalmist.\n\nWe all, as before, and the cook-maid too, attended the prayers of the\nchurch in the afternoon; and my dear father concluded with the following\nstanzas of the cxlvth psalm; suitably magnifying the holy name of God\nfor all mercies; but did not observe, altogether, the method in which\nthey stand; which was the less necessary, he thought, as he gave out the\nlines.\n\n\n    The Lord is just in all his ways:\n      His works are holy all:\n    And he is near all those that do\n      In truth upon him call.\n\n    He the desires of all them\n      That fear him, will fulfil;\n    And he will hear them when they cry,\n      And save them all he will.\n\n    The eyes of all do wait on thee;\n      Thou dost them all relieve:\n    And thou to each sufficient food,\n      In season due, dost give.\n\n    Thou openest thy plenteous hand,\n      And bounteously dost fill\n    All things whatever, that do live,\n      With gifts of thy good will.\n\n    My thankful mouth shall gladly speak\n      The praises of the Lord:\n    All flesh, to praise his holy name,\n      For ever shall accord.\n\n\nWe walked in the garden till tea was ready; and as he went by the\nback-door, my master said to me, Of all the flowers in the garden, the\nsun-flower is the fairest!--O, sir, said I, let that be now forgot!\nMr. Williams heard him say so, and seemed a little out of countenance:\nWhereupon my master said, I mean not to make you serious, Mr. Williams;\nbut we see how strangely things are brought about. I see other scenes\nhereabouts, that, in my Pamela's dangers, give me more cause of concern,\nthan any thing you ever did should give you. Sir, said he, you are very\ngenerous.\n\nMy master and Mr. Williams afterwards walked together for a quarter of\nan hour; and talked about general things, and some scholastic subjects;\nand joined us, very well pleased with one another's conversation.\n\nLady Jones said, putting herself on one side of me, as my master was on\nthe other, But pray, sir, when is the happy time to be? We want it over,\nthat we may have you with us as long afterwards as you can. Said my\nmaster, I would have it to-morrow, or next day at farthest, if Pamela\nwill: for I have sent for a license, and the messenger will be here\nto-night, or early in the morning, I hope. But, added he, pray, Pamela,\ndo not take beyond Thursday. She was pleased to say, Sure it will not be\ndelayed by you, madam, more than needs!--Well, said he, now you are on\nmy side, I will leave you with her to settle it: and, I hope, she will\nnot let little bashful niceties be important with her; and so he joined\nthe two misses.\n\nLady Jones told me, I was to blame, she would take upon her to say, if I\ndelayed it a moment; because she understood Lady Davers was very uneasy\nat the prospect, that it would be so; and if any thing should happen, it\nwould be a sad thing!--Madam, said I, when he was pleased to mention\nit to me first, he said it should be in fourteen days; and afterwards,\nasked me if I would have it in the first or the second seven? I\nanswered--for how could I do otherwise?--In the second. He desired it\nmight not be the last day of the second seven. Now, madam, said I, as\nhe was then pleased to speak his mind, no doubt, I would not, for any\nthing, seem too forward.\n\nWell, but, said she, as he now urges you in so genteel and gentlemanly a\nmanner for a shorter day, I think, if I was in your place, I would agree\nto it. She saw me hesitate and blush, and said, Well, you know best; but\nI say only what I would do. I said, I would consider of it; and if I saw\nhe was very earnest, to be sure I should think I ought to oblige him.\n\nMisses Darnford were begging to be at the wedding, and to have a ball:\nand they said, Pray, Mrs. Andrews, second our requests, and we shall be\ngreatly obliged to you. Indeed, ladies, said I, I cannot promise that,\nif I might.--Why so? said they.--Because, answered I--I know not what!\nBut I think one may, with pleasure, celebrate an anniversary of one's\nnuptials; but the day itself--Indeed, ladies, I think it is too solemn a\nbusiness, for the parties of our sex to be very gay upon: it is a quite\nserious and awful affair: and I am sure, in your own cases, you would be\nof my mind. Why, then, said Miss Darnford, the more need one has to be\nas light-hearted and merry as one can.\n\nI told you, said my master, what sort of an answer you'd have from\nPamela. The younger miss said, She never heard of such grave folks in\nher life, on such an occasion: Why, sir, said she, I hope you'll sing\npsalms all day, and miss will fast and pray! Such sackcloth and\nashes doings, for a wedding, did I never hear of!--She spoke a little\nspitefully, I thought; and I returned no answer. I shall have enough to\ndo, I reckon, in a while, if I am to answer every one that will envy me!\n\nWe went in to tea; and all that the ladies could prevail upon my master\nfor, was a dancing match before he left this county: But Miss Darnford\nsaid, It should then be at their house; for, truly, if she might not be\nat the wedding, she would be affronted, and come no more hither, till we\nhad been there.\n\nWhen they were gone, my master would have had my father stay till the\naffair was over; but he begged he might set out as soon as it was light\nin the morning; for, he said, my mother would be doubly uneasy at his\nstay; and he burned with impatience to let her know all the happy things\nthat had befallen her daughter. When my master found him so desirous to\ngo, he called Mr. Thomas, and ordered him to get a particular bay horse\nready betimes in the morning, for my father, and a portmanteau, to put\nhis things in; and to attend him a day's journey: And if, said he, Mr.\nAndrews chooses it, see him safe to his own home: And, added he, since\nthat horse will serve you, Mr. Andrews, to ride backwards and forwards,\nto see us, when we go into Bedfordshire, I make you a present of it,\nwith the accoutrements. And, seeing my father going to speak, he added,\nI won't be said nay. O how good was this!\n\nHe also said a great many kind things at supper-time, and gave him all\nthe papers he had of mine; but desired, when he and my mother had read\nthem, that he would return them to him again. And then he said, So\naffectionate a father and daughter may, perhaps, be glad to be alone\ntogether; therefore remember me to your good wife, and tell her, it\nwill not be long, I hope, before I see you together; on a visit to your\ndaughter, at my other house: and so I wish you good night, and a good\njourney, if you go before I see you. And then he shook hands, and left\nmy dear father almost unable to speak, through the sense of his favours\nand goodness.\n\nYou may believe, my dear mother, how loath I was to part with my\ngood father; and he was also unwilling to part with me; but he was so\nimpatient to see you, and tell you the blessed tidings, with which his\nheart overflowed, that I could hardly wish to detain him.\n\nMrs. Jewkes brought two bottles of cherry-brandy, and two of\ncinnamon-water, and some cake; and they were put up in the portmanteau,\nwith my father's newly presented clothes; for he said, He would not,\nfor any thing, be seen in them in his neighbourhood, till I was actually\nknown, by every body, to be married; nor would he lay out any part of\nthe twenty guineas till then neither, for fear of reflections; and\nthen he would consult me as to what he would buy. Well, said I, as you\nplease, my dear father; and I hope now we shall often have the pleasure\nof hearing from one another, without needing any art or contrivances.\n\nHe said, He would go to bed betimes, that he might be up as soon as it\nwas light; and so he took leave of me, and said, He would not love me,\nif I got up in the morning to see him go; which would but make us both\nloath to part, and grieve us both all day.\n\nMr. Thomas brought him a pair of boots, and told him, He would call him\nup at peep of day, and put up every thing over night; and so I received\nhis blessing, and his prayers, and his kind promises of procuring the\nsame from you, my dear mother; and went up to my closet with a heavy\nheart, and yet a half-pleased one, if I may so say; for that, as he must\ngo, he was going to the best of wives, and with the best of tidings.\nBut I begged he would not work so hard as he had done; for I was sure\nmy master would not have given him twenty guineas for clothes, if he\nhad not designed to do something else for him; and that he should be the\nless concerned at receiving benefits, from my good master, because he,\nwho had so many persons to employ in his large possessions, could make\nhim serviceable, to a degree equivalent, without hurting any body else.\n\nHe promised me fair; and, pray, dear mother, see he performs. I hope my\nmaster will not see this: for I will not send it you, at present, till\nI can send you the best of news; and the rather, as my dear father can\nsupply the greatest part of what I have written, since the papers he\ncarries you, by his own observation. So good night, my dear mother: And\nGod send my father a safe journey, and a happy meeting to you both!\n\n\nMonday.\n\nMr. Colbrand being returned, my master came up to me to my closet, and\nbrought me the license. O how my heart fluttered at the sight of it!\nNow, Pamela, said he, tell me, if you can oblige me with the day. Your\nword is all that's wanting. I made bold to kiss his dear hand; and,\nthough unable to look up, said--I know not what to say, sir, to all your\ngoodness: I would not, for any consideration, that you should believe me\ncapable of receiving negligently an honour, that all the duty of a long\nlife, were it to be lent me, will not be sufficient to enable me to be\ngrateful for. I ought to resign myself, in every thing I may or\ncan, implicitly to your will. But--But what? said he, with a kind\nimpatience.--Why, sir, said I, when from last Thursday you mentioned\nfour days, I had reason to think that term your choice; and my heart\nis so wholly yours, that I am afraid of nothing, but that I may be\nforwarder than you wish. Impossible, my dear creature! said he, and\nfolded me in his arms: Impossible! If this be all, it shall be set about\nthis moment, and this happy day shall make you mine!--I'll send away\ninstantly, said the dear gentleman; and was going.\n\nI said, No, pray, sir, pray, sir, hear me!--Indeed it cannot be\nto-day!--Cannot! said he.--No, indeed, sir! said I--And was ready to\nsink to see his generous impatience. Why flattered you then my fond\nheart, replied he, with the hope that it might?--Sir, said I, I will\ntell you what I had thought, if you'll vouchsafe me your attention. Do\nthen, said he.\n\nI have, sir, proceeded I, a great desire, that, whenever the day is,\nit may be on a Thursday: On a Thursday my dear father and mother were\nmarried; and, though poor, they are a very happy pair.--On a Thursday\nyour poor Pamela was born. On a Thursday my dear good lady took me from\nmy parents into her protection. On a Thursday, sir, you caused me to be\ncarried away to this place, to which I now, by God's goodness, and your\nfavour, owe so amazingly all my present prospects; and on a Thursday it\nwas, you named to me, that fourteen days from that you would confirm my\nhappiness. Now, sir, if you please to indulge my superstitious folly,\nyou will greatly oblige me. I was sorry, sir, for this reason, when you\nbid me not defer till the last day of the fourteen, that Thursday in\nnext week was that last day.\n\nThis, Pamela, is a little superstitious, I must needs say; and I think\nyou should begin now to make another day in the week a happy one; as for\nexample; on a Monday, may you say, my father and mother concluded to be\nmarried on the Thursday following. On a Monday, so many years ago,\nmy mother was preparing all her matters to be brought to bed on the\nThursday following. On a Monday, several weeks ago, it was that you had\nbut two days more to stay, till you was carried away on Thursday. On a\nMonday, I myself, said he, well remember, it was that I wrote you the\nletter, that prevailed on you so kindly to return to me; and on the same\nday you did return to my house here; which I hope, my girl, will be as\npropitious an era as any you have named: And now, lastly, will you say,\nwhich will crown the work; And, on a Monday I was married.--Come, come,\nmy dear, added he, Thursday has reigned long enough o'conscience; let us\nnow set Monday in its place, or at least on an equality with it, since\nyou see it has a very good title, and as we now stand in the week before\nus, claims priority: And then, I hope, we shall make Tuesday, Wednesday,\nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday, as happy days as Monday and Thursday; and\nso, by God's blessing, move round, as the days move, in a delightful\ncircle, till we are at a loss what day to prefer to the rest.\n\nO how charmingly was this said!--And how sweetly kind!\n\nIndeed, sir, said I, you rally my folly very agreeably; but don't let a\nlittle matter stand in the way, when you are so generously obliging in a\ngreater: Indeed I like Thursday best, if I may choose.\n\nWell, then, said he, if you can say you have a better reason than this,\nI will oblige you; else I'll send away for the parson this moment.\n\nAnd so, I protest, he was going!--Dear sirs, how I trembled! Stay, stay,\nsir, said I: we have a great deal to say first; I have a deal of silly\nprate to trouble you with!--Well, say then, in a minute, replied he, the\nmost material: for all we have to say may be talked of while the\nparson is coming.--O, but indeed, and indeed, said I, it cannot be\nto-day!--Well, then, shall it be to-morrow? said he.--Why, sir, if it\nmust not be on a Thursday, you have given so many pleasant distinctions\nfor a Monday, that let it then be next Monday.--What! a week still? said\nhe. Sir, answered I, if you please; for that will be, as you enjoined,\nwithin the second seven days. Why, girl, said he, 'twill be seven months\ntill next Monday. Let it, said he, if not to-morrow, be on Wednesday; I\nprotest I will stay no longer.\n\nThen, sir, returned I, please to defer it, however, for one day more,\nand it will be my beloved Thursday! If I consent to defer it till then,\nmay I hope, my Pamela, said he, that next Thursday shall certainly be\nthe happy day?--Yes, sir, said I and I am sure I looked very foolishly!\n\nAnd yet, my dear father and mother, why should I, with such a fine\ngentleman? And whom I so dearly love? And so much to my honour too?\nBut there is something greatly awful upon my mind, in the solemn\ncircumstance, and a change of condition never to be recalled, though all\nthe prospects are so desirable. And I can but wonder at the thoughtless\nprecipitancy with which most young folks run into this important change\nof life!\n\nSo now, my dear parents, have I been brought to fix so near a day as\nnext Thursday; and this is Monday. O dear, it makes one out of breath\nalmost to think of it! This, though, was a great cut off; a whole week\nout of ten days. I hope I am not too forward! I'm sure, if it obliges my\ndear master, I am justified; for he deserves of me all things in my poor\npower.\n\nAfter this, he rode out on horseback, attended by Abraham, and did not\nreturn till night. How by degrees things steal upon one! I thought even\nthis small absence tedious; and the more, as we expected him home to\ndinner.--I wish I may not be too fond, and make him indifferent: But\nyet, my dear father and mother, you were always fond of one another, and\nnever indifferent, let the world run as it would.\n\nWhen he returned, he said, He had had a pleasant ride, and was led out\nto a greater distance than he intended. At supper he told me, that he\nhad a great mind Mr. Williams should marry us; because, he said, it\nwould shew a thorough reconciliation on his part. But, said he, most\ngenerously, I am apprehensive, from what passed between you, that the\npoor man will take it hardly, and as a sort of insult, which I am not\ncapable of. What says my girl?--Do you think he would? I hope not, sir,\nsaid I: As to what he may think, I can't answer; but as to any reason\nfor his thoughts, I can: For indeed, sir, said I, you have been already\nso generous, that he cannot, I think, mistake your goodness.\n\nHe then spoke with some resentment of Lady Davers's behaviour, and I\nasked, if any thing new had occurred? Yes, said he; I have had a\nletter delivered me from her impertinent husband, professedly at her\ninstigation, that amounted to little less than a piece of insolent\nbravery, on supposing I was about to marry you. I was so provoked,\nadded he, that after I had read it, I tore it in a hundred pieces, and\nscattered them in the air, and bid the man who brought it let his master\nknow what I had done with his letter; and so would not permit him to\nspeak to me, as he would fain have done,--I think the fellow talked\nsomewhat of his lady coming hither; but she shall not set her foot\nwithin my doors; and I suppose this treatment will hinder her.\n\nI was much concerned at this: And he said, Had I a hundred sisters,\nPamela, their opposition should have no weight with me: and I did not\nintend you should know it; but you can't but expect a little difficulty\nfrom the pride of my sister, who have suffered so much from that of\nher brother; and we are too nearly allied in mind, as well as blood, I\nfind.--But this is not her business: And if she would have made it so,\nshe should have done it with more decency. Little occasion had she to\nboast of her birth, that knows not what belongs to good manners.\n\nI said, I am very sorry, sir, to be the unhappy occasion of a\nmisunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister. Don't\nsay so, Pamela, because this is an unavoidable consequence of the\nhappy prospect before us. Only bear it well yourself, because she is my\nsister; and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own rashness.\n\nIf, sir, said I, the most lowly behaviour, and humble deportment, and in\nevery thing shewing a dutiful regard to good Lady Davers, will have any\nweight with her ladyship, assure yourself of all in my power to mollify\nher. No, Pamela, returned he; don't imagine, when you are my wife, I\nwill suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character. I know the\nduty of a husband, and will protect your gentleness to the utmost, as\nmuch as if you were a princess by descent.\n\nYou are inexpressibly good, sir, said I; but I am far from taking a\ngentle disposition to shew a meanness of spirit: And this is a trial I\nought to expect; and well I may bear it, that have so many benefits to\nset against it, which all spring from the same cause.\n\nWell, said he, all the matter shall be this: We will talk of our\nmarriage as a thing to be done next week. I find I have spies upon\nme wherever I go, and whatever I do: But now, I am on so laudable\na pursuit, that I value them not, nor those who employ them. I have\nalready ordered my servants to have no conference with any body for\nten or twelve days to come. And Mrs. Jewkes tells me every one names\nThursday come se'nnight for our nuptials. So I will get Mr. Peters, who\nwants to see my little chapel, to assist Mr. Williams, under the notion\nof breakfasting with me next Thursday morning, since you won't have it\nsooner; and there will nobody else be wanting; and I will beg of Mr.\nPeters to keep it private, even from his own family, for a few days. Has\nmy girl any objection?\n\nO, sir, answered I, you are so generous in all your ways, I can have\nno objections!--But I hope Lady Davers and you will not proceed to\nirreconcilable lengths; and when her ladyship comes to see you, and to\ntarry with you, two or three weeks, as she used to do, I will keep close\nup, so as not to disgust her with the sight of me.\n\nWell, Pamela, said he, we will talk of that afterwards. You must do then\nas I shall think fit: And I shall be able to judge what both you and I\nought to do. But what still aggravates the matter is, that she should\ninstigate the titled ape her husband to write to me, after she had so\nlittle succeeded herself. I wish I had kept his letter, that I might\nhave shewn you how a man, that generally acts like a fool, can take upon\nhim to write like a lord. But I suppose it is of my sister's penning,\nand he, poor man! is the humble copier.\n\n\nTuesday.\n\nMr. Thomas is returned from you, my dear father, with the good news\nof your health, and your proceeding in your journey to my dear mother,\nwhere I hope to hear soon you are arrived. My master has just now been\nmaking me play upon the spinnet, and sing to it; and was pleased to\ncommend me for both. But he does so for every thing I do, so partial\ndoes his goodness make him to me.\n\n\nOne o'clock.\n\nWe are just returned from an airing in the chariot; and I have\nbeen delighted with his conversation upon English authors, poets\nparticularly. He entertained me also with a description of some of\nthe curiosities he had seen in Italy and France, when he made what the\npolite world call the grand tour. He said he wanted to be at his other\nseat, for he knew not well how to employ himself here, having not\nproposed to stay half the time: And when I get there, Pamela, said he,\nyou will hardly be troubled with so much of my company, after we have\nsettled; for I have a great many things to adjust: And I must go to\nLondon; for I have accounts that have run on longer than ordinary with\nmy banker there. And I don't know, added he, but the ensuing winter I\nmay give you a little taste of the diversions of the town for a month\nor so. I said, His will and pleasure should determine mine; and I never\nwould, as near as I could, have a desire after those, or any other\nentertainments that were not in his own choice.\n\nHe was pleased to say, I make no doubt but that I shall be very happy\nin you; and hope you will be so in me: For, said he, I have no very\nenormous vices to gratify; though I pretend not to the greatest purity,\nneither, my girl. Sir, said I, if you can account to your own mind,\nI shall always be easy in whatever you do. But our greatest happiness\nhere, sir, continued I, is of very short duration; and this life, at the\nlongest, is a poor transitory one; and I hope we shall be so happy as\nto be enabled to look forward, with comfort, to another, where our\npleasures will be everlasting.\n\nYou say well, Pamela; and I shall, by degrees, be more habituated to\nthis way of thinking, as I more and more converse with you; but, at\npresent, you must not be over serious with me all at once: though\nI charge you never forbear to mingle your sweet divinity in our\nconversation, whenever it can be brought in a propos, and with such\na cheerfulness of temper, as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over our\ninnocent enjoyments.\n\nI was abashed at this, and silent, fearing I had offended: But he said,\nIf you attend rightly to what I said, I need not tell you again, Pamela,\nnot to be discouraged from suggesting to me, on every proper occasion,\nthe pious impulses of your own amiable mind. Sir, said I, you will be\nalways indulgent, I make no doubt, to my imperfections, so long as I\nmean well.\n\nMy master made me dine with him, and would eat nothing but what I helped\nhim to; and my heart is, every hour, more and more enlarged with his\ngoodness and condescension. But still, what ails me, I wonder! A strange\nsort of weight hangs upon my mind, as Thursday draws on, which makes\nme often sigh involuntarily, and damps, at times, the pleasures of my\ndelightful prospects!--I hope this is not ominous; but only the foolish\nweakness of an over-thoughtful mind, on an occasion the most solemn and\nimportant of one's life, next to the last scene, which shuts up all.\n\nI could be very serious: But I will commit all my ways to that blessed\nProvidence, which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me through real\nevils to this hopeful situation.\n\nI only fear, and surely I have great reason, that I shall be too\nunworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman!--God teach me\nhumility, and to know my own demerit! And this will be, next to his\ngrace, my surest guard, in the state of life to which, though most\nunworthy, I am going to be exalted. And don't cease your prayers for\nme, my dear parents; for, perhaps, this new condition may be subject\nto still worse hazards than those I have escaped; as would be the case,\nwere conceitedness, vanity, and pride, to take hold of my frail heart;\nand if I was, for my sins, to be left to my own conduct, a frail bark\nin a tempestuous ocean, without ballast, or other pilot than my own\ninconsiderate will. But my master said, on another occasion, That those\nwho doubted most, always erred least; and I hope I shall always doubt my\nown strength, my own worthiness.\n\nI will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things that passed in\nconversation with my excellent benefactor; nor with the civilities of\nM. Colbrand, Mrs. Jewkes, and all the servants, who seem to be highly\npleased with me, and with my conduct to them: And as my master,\nhitherto, finds no fault that I go too low, nor they that I carry it too\nhigh, I hope I shall continue to have every body's good-will: But yet\nwill I not seek to gain any one's by little meannesses or debasements!\nbut aim at an uniform and regular conduct, willing to conceal\ninvoluntary errors, as I would have my own forgiven; and not too\nindustrious to discover real ones, or to hide such, if any such should\nappear, as might encourage bad hearts, or unclean hands, in material\ncases, where my master should receive damage, or where the morals of the\ntransgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt. In short, I\nwill endeavour, as much as I can, that good servants shall find in me a\nkind encourager; indifferent ones be made better, by inspiring them with\na laudable emulation; and bad ones, if not too bad in nature, and quite\nirreclaimable, reformed by kindness, expostulation, and even proper\nmenaces, if necessary; but most by a good example: All this if God\npleases.\n\n\nWednesday.\n\nNow, my dear parents, I have but this one day between me and the most\nsolemn rite that can be performed. My heart cannot yet shake off this\nheavy weight. Sure I am ungrateful to the divine goodness, and the\nfavour of the best of benefactors!--Yet I hope I am not!--For, at times,\nmy mind is all exultation, with the prospect of what good to-morrow's\nhappy solemnity may possibly, by the leave of my generous master, put it\nin my power to do. O how shall I find words to express, as I ought, my\nthankfulness, for all the mercies before me!\n\n\nWednesday evening.\n\nMy dear master is all love and tenderness. He sees my weakness, and\ngenerously pities and comforts me! I begged to be excused supper; but\nhe brought me down himself from my closet, and placed me by him, bidding\nAbraham not wait. I could not eat, and yet I tried, for fear he should\nbe angry. He kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful, yet\ndelightful to-morrow! and put, now and then, a little bit on my plate,\nand guided it to my mouth. I was concerned to receive his goodness with\nso ill a grace. Well, said he, if you won't eat with me, drink at least\nwith me: I drank two glasses by his over-persuasions, and said, I am\nreally ashamed of myself. Why, indeed, said he, my dear girl, I am not\na very dreadful enemy, I hope! I cannot bear any thing that is the least\nconcerning to you. Oh, sir! said I, all is owing to the sense I have of\nmy own unworthiness!--To be sure, it cannot be any thing else.\n\nHe rung for the things to be taken away; and then reached a chair,\nand sat down by me, and put his kind arms about me, and said the most\ngenerous and affecting things that ever dropt from the honey-flowing\nmouth of love. All I have not time to repeat: some I will. And oh!\nindulge your foolish daughter, who troubles you with her weak nonsense;\nbecause what she has to say, is so affecting to her; and because, if she\nwent to bed, instead of scribbling, she could not sleep.\n\nThis sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved Pamela, said\nthe kind man, on the near approach of our happy union, when I hope all\ndoubts are cleared up, and nothing of dishonour is apprehended, shew me\nmost abundantly, what a wretch I was to attempt such purity with a worse\nintention--No wonder, that one so virtuous should find herself deserted\nof life itself on a violence so dreadful to her honour, and seek a\nrefuge in the shadow of death.--But now, my dearest Pamela, that you\nhave seen a purity on my side, as nearly imitating your own, as our sex\ncan shew to yours; and since I have, all the day long, suppressed even\nthe least intimation of the coming days, that I might not alarm your\ntender mind; why all this concern, why all this affecting, yet sweet\nconfusion? You have a generous friend, my dear girl, in me; a protector\nnow, not a violator of your innocence: Why then, once more I ask, this\nstrange perplexity, this sweet confusion?\n\nO sir, said I, and hid my face on his arm; expect not reason from a\nfoolish creature: You should have still indulged me in my closet: I am\nready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to your goodness. But\nI know not what!--I am, to be sure, a silly creature! O had you but\nsuffered me to stay by myself above, I should have made myself ashamed\nof so culpable a behaviour!--But goodness added to goodness every\nmoment, and the sense of my own unworthiness, quite overcome my spirits.\n\nNow, said the generous man, will I, though reluctantly, make a proposal\nto my sweet girl.--If I have been too pressing for the day: If another\nday will still be more obliging: If you have fears you will not then\nhave; you shall say but the word, and I'll submit. Yes, my Pamela; for\nthough I have, these three days past, thought every tedious hour a day,\ntill Thursday comes, if you earnestly desire it, I will postpone it.\nSay, my dear girl, freely say; but accept not my proposal, without great\nreason, which yet I will not ask for.\n\nSir, said I, I can expect nothing but superlative goodness, I have been\nso long used to it from you. This is a most generous instance of it; but\nI fear--yes, I fear it will be too much the same thing, some days hence,\nwhen the happy, yet, fool that I am! dreaded time, shall be equally\nnear!\n\nKind, lovely charmer! said he, now do I see you are to be trusted with\npower, from the generous use you make of it!--Not one offensive word or\nlook, from me, shall wound your nicest thoughts; but pray try to subdue\nthis over-scrupulousness, and unseasonable timidity. I persuade myself\nyou will if you can.\n\nIndeed, sir, I will, said I; for I am quite ashamed of myself, with all\nthese lovely views before me!--The honours you do me, the kindness you\nshew me!--I cannot forgive myself! For, oh! if I know the least of\nthis idle foolish heart of mine, it has not a misgiving thought of\nyour goodness; and I should abhor it, if it were capable of the least\naffectation.--But, dear good sir, leave me a little to myself, and I\nwill take myself to a severer task than your goodness will let you do\nand I will present my heart before you, a worthier offering to you, than\nat present its wayward follies will let it seem to be.--But one thing\nis, one has no kind friend of one's own sex, to communicate one's\nfoolish thoughts to, and to be strengthened by their comfortings! But I\nam left to myself; and, oh! what a weak silly thing I am!\n\nHe kindly withdrew, to give me time to recollect myself; and in about\nhalf an hour returned: and then, that he might not begin at once upon\nthe subject, and say, at the same time, something agreeable to me, said,\nYour father and mother have had a great deal of talk by this time about\nyou, Pamela. O, sir, returned I, your goodness has made them quite\nhappy! But I can't help being concerned about Lady Davers.\n\nHe said, I am vexed I did not hear the footman out; because it runs in\nmy head he talked somewhat about her coming hither. She will meet with\nbut an indifferent reception from me, unless she comes resolved to\nbehave better than she writes.\n\nPray, sir, said I, be pleased to bear with my good lady, for two\nreasons. What are they? said he. Why, first, sir, answered I, because\nshe is your sister; and, to be sure, may very well think, what all the\nworld will, that you have much undervalued yourself in making me happy.\nAnd next, because, if her ladyship finds you out of temper with her, it\nwill still aggravate her more against me; and every time that any warm\nwords you may have between you, come into her mind, she will disdain me\nmore.\n\nDon't concern yourself about it, said he; for we have more proud ladies\nthan she in our other neighbourhood, who, perhaps, have still less\nreason to be punctilious about their descent, and yet will form\nthemselves upon her example, and say, Why, his own sister will not\nforgive him, nor visit him! And so, if I can subdue her spirit, which is\nmore than her husband ever could, or indeed any body else, it is a great\npoint gained: And, if she gives me reason, I'll try for it, I assure\nyou.\n\nWell, but, my dear girl, continued he, since the subject is so\nimportant, may I not say one word about to-morrow?--Sir, said I, I hope\nI shall be less a fool: I have talked as harshly to my heart, as Lady\nDavers can do; and the naughty thing suggests to me a better, and more\ngrateful behaviour.\n\nHe smiled, and, kissing me, said, I took notice, Pamela, of what you\nobserved, that you have none of your own sex with you; I think it is a\nlittle hard upon you; and I should have liked you should have had Miss\nDarnford; but then her sister must have been asked; and I might as well\nmake a public wedding: which, you know, would have required clothes and\nother preparations. Besides, added he, a foolish proposal was once made\nme of that second sister, who has two or three thousand pounds more than\nthe other, left her by a godmother, and she can't help being a little\npiqued; though, said he, it was a proposal they could not expect should\nsucceed; for there is nothing in her person nor mind; and her fortune,\nas that must have been the only inducement, would not do by any means;\nand so I discouraged it at once.\n\nI am thinking, sir, said I, of another mortifying thing too; that were\nyou to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to your own, all\nthe eve to the day would be taken up in reading, signing, and sealing of\nsettlements, and portion, and such like: But now the poor Pamela brings\nyou nothing at all: And the very clothes she wears, so very low is she,\nare entirely the effects of your bounty, and that of your good mother:\nThis makes me a little sad: For, alas! sir, I am so much oppressed\nby your favours, and the sense of the obligations I lie under, that\nI cannot look up with the confidence that I otherwise should, on this\nawful occasion.\n\nThere is, my dear Pamela, said he, where the power is wanting, as much\ngenerosity in the will as in the action. To all that know your story,\nand your merit, it will appear that I cannot recompense you for what\nI have made you suffer. You have had too many hard struggles and\nexercises; and have nobly overcome: and who shall grudge you the reward\nof the hard-bought victory?--This affair is so much the act of my\nown will, that I glory in being capable of distinguishing so much\nexcellence; and my fortune is the more pleasurable to me, as it gives\nme hope, that I may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have\nundergone.\n\nThis, sir, said I, is all goodness, unmerited on my side; and makes my\nobligations the greater. I can only wish for more worthiness.--But how\npoor is it to offer nothing but words for such generous deeds!--And to\nsay, I wish!--For what is a wish, but the acknowledged want of power to\noblige, and a demonstration of one's poverty in every thing but will?\n\nAnd that, my dear girl, said he, is every thing: 'Tis all I want: 'Tis\nall that Heaven itself requires of us: But no more of these little\ndoubts, though they are the natural impulses of a generous and grateful\nheart: I want not to be employed in settlements. Those are for such to\nregard, who make convenience and fortune the prime considerations. I\nhave possessions ample enough for us both; and you deserve to share\nthem with me; and you shall do it, with as little reserve, as if you\nhad brought me what the world reckons an equivalent: for, as to my own\nopinion, you bring me what is infinitely more valuable, an experienced\ntruth, a well-tried virtue, and a wit and behaviour more than equal to\nthe station you will be placed in: To say nothing of this sweet person,\nthat itself might captivate a monarch; and of the meekness of temper,\nand sweetness of disposition, which make you superior to all the women I\never saw.\n\nThus kind and soothing, and honourably affectionate, was the dear\ngentleman, to the unworthy, doubting, yet assured Pamela; and thus\npatiently did he indulge, and generously pardon, my impertinent\nweakness. He offered to go himself to Lady Jones, in the morning, and\nreveal the matter to her, and desire her secrecy and presence; but I\nsaid, That would disoblige the young Ladies Darnford. No, sir, said I, I\nwill cast myself upon your generous kindness; for why should I fear the\nkind protector of my weakness, and the guide and director of my future\nsteps?\n\nYou cannot, said he, forgive Mrs. Jewkes; for she must know it; and\nsuffer her to be with you? Yes, sir, said I, I can. She is very civil\nto me now: and her former wickedness I will forgive, for the sake of the\nhappy fruits that have attended it; and because you mention her.\n\nWell, said he, I will call her in, if you please.--As you please, sir,\nsaid I. And he rung for her; and when she came in, he said, Mrs. Jewkes,\nI am going to entrust you with a secret. Sir, answered she, I will be\nsure to keep it as such. Why, said he, we intend to-morrow, privately as\npossible, for our wedding-day; and Mr. Peters and Mr. Williams are to be\nhere, as to breakfast with me, and to shew Mr. Peters my little chapel.\nAs soon as the ceremony is over, we will take a little airing in the\nchariot, as we have done at other times; and so it will not be wondered\nthat we are dressed. And the two parsons have promised secrecy, and will\ngo home. I believe you can't well avoid letting one of the maids into\nthe secret; but that I'll leave to you.\n\nSir, replied she, we all concluded it would be in a few days! and I\ndoubt it won't be long a secret. No, said he, I don't desire it should;\nbut you know we are not provided for a public wedding, and I shall\ndeclare it when we go to Bedfordshire, which won't be long. But the men,\nwho lie in the outhouses, need not know it; for, by some means or other,\nmy sister Davers knows all that passes.\n\nDo you know, sir, said she, that her ladyship intends to be down here\nwith you in a few days? Her servant told me so, who brought you the\nletter you were angry at.\n\nI hope, said he, we shall be set out for t'other house first; and shall\nbe pleased she loses her labour. Sir, continued she, her ladyship,\nproposes to be here time enough to hinder your nuptials, which she\ntakes, as we did, will be the latter end of next week. Well, said he,\nlet her come: but yet I desire not to see her.\n\nMrs. Jewkes said to me, Give me leave, madam, to wish you all manner\nof happiness: But I am afraid I have too well obeyed his honour, to be\nforgiven by you. Indeed, Mrs. Jewkes, returned I, you will be more\nyour own enemy than I will be. I will look all forward: and shall not\npresume, so much as by a whisper, to set my good master against any one\nhe pleases to approve of: And as to his old servants, I shall always\nvalue them, and never offer to dictate to his choice, or influence it by\nmy own caprices.\n\nMrs. Jewkes, said my master, you find you have no cause to apprehend\nany thing. My Pamela is very placable; and as we have both been sinners\ntogether, we must both be included in one act of grace.\n\nSuch an example of condescension, as I have before me, Mrs. Jewkes, said\nI, may make you very easy; for I must be highly unworthy, if I did not\nforego all my little resentments, if I had any, for the sake of so much\ngoodness to myself.\n\nYou are very kind, madam, said she; and you may depend upon it, I will\natone for all my faults, by my future duty and respect to you, as well\nas to my master.\n\nThat's well said on both sides, said he: but, Mrs. Jewkes, to assure\nyou, that my good girl here has no malice, she chooses you to attend\nher in the morning at the ceremony, and you must keep up her spirits.--I\nshall, replied she, be very proud of the honour: But I cannot, madam,\nbut wonder to see you so very low-spirited, as you have been these two\nor three days past, with so much happiness before you.\n\nWhy, Mrs. Jewkes, answered I, there can be but one reason given;\nand that is, that I am a sad fool!--But, indeed, I am not ungrateful\nneither; nor would I put on a foolish affectation: But my heart, at\ntimes, sinks within me; I know not why, except at my own unworthiness,\nand because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself\nunder, as I should do. It is an honour, Mrs. Jewkes, added I, I was not\nborn to; and no wonder, then, I behave so awkwardly. She made me a\nfine compliment upon it, and withdrew, repeating her promises of care,\nsecrecy, etc.\n\nHe parted from me with very great tenderness; and I came up and set to\nwriting, to amuse my thoughts, and wrote thus far. And Mrs. Jewkes being\ncome up, and it being past twelve, I will go to bed; but not one wink, I\nfear, shall I get this night.--I could beat myself for anger. Sure\nthere is nothing ominous in this strange folly!--But I suppose all young\nmaidens are the same, so near so great a change of condition, though\nthey carry it off more discreetly than I.\n\n\nThursday, six o'clock in the morning.\n\nI might as well have not gone to bed last night, for what sleep I had.\nMrs. Jewkes often was talking to me, and said several things that would\nhave been well enough from any body else of our sex; but the poor woman\nhas so little purity of heart, that it is all say from her, and goes no\nfarther than the ear.\n\nI fancy my master has not slept much neither; for I heard him up, and\nwalking about his chamber, ever since break of day. To be sure, good\ngentleman! he must have some concern, as well as I; for here he is going\nto marry a poor foolish unworthy girl, brought up on the charity, as one\nmay say, (at least bounty,) of his worthy family! And this foolish girl\nmust be, to all intents and purposes, after twelve o'clock this day, as\nmuch his wife, as if he were to marry a duchess!--And here he must stand\nthe shocks of common reflection! The great Mr. B---- has done finely! he\nhas married his poor servant wench! will some say. The ridicule and rude\njests of his equals, and companions too, he must stand: And the disdain\nof his relations, and indignation of Lady Davers, his lofty sister! Dear\ngood gentleman! he will have enough to do, to be sure! O how shall I\nmerit all these things at his hand! I can only do the best I can; and\npray to God to reward him; and resolve to love him with a pure heart,\nand serve him with a sincere obedience. I hope the dear gentleman will\ncontinue to love me for this; for, alas! I have nothing else to offer!\nBut, as I can hardly expect so great a blessing, if I can be secure\nfrom his contempt, I shall not be unfortunate; and must bear his\nindifference, if his rich friends should inspire him with it, and\nproceed with doing my duty with cheerfulness.\n\n\nHalf an hour past eight o'clock.\n\nMy good dear master, my kind friend, my generous benefactor, my worthy\nprotector, and, oh! all the good words in one, my affectionate husband,\nthat is soon to be--(be curbed in, my proud heart, know thy self, and\nbe conscious of thy unworthiness!)--has just left me, with the kindest,\ntenderest expressions, and gentlest behaviour, that ever blest a happy\nmaiden. He approached me with a sort of reined-in rapture. My Pamela!\nsaid he, May I just ask after your employment? Don't let me chide my\ndear girl this day, however. The two parsons will be here to breakfast\nwith us at nine; and yet you are not a bit dressed! Why this absence of\nmind, and sweet irresolution?\n\nWhy, indeed, sir, said I, I will set about a reformation this instant.\nHe saw the common-prayer book lying in the window. I hope, said he, my\nlovely maiden has been conning the lesson she is by-and-by to repeat.\nHave you not, Pamela? and clasped his arms about me, and kissed me.\nIndeed, sir, said I, I have been reading over the solemn service.--And\nwhat thinks my fairest (for so he called me) of it?--O sir, 'tis very\nawful, and makes one shudder, to reflect upon it!--No wonder, said\nhe, it should affect my sweet Pamela: I have been looking into it this\nmorning, and I can't say but I think it a solemn, but very suitable\nservice. But this I tell my dear love, continued he, and again clasped\nme to him, there is not a tittle in it that I cannot joyfully subscribe\nto: And that, my dear Pamela, should make you easy, and join cheerfully\nin it with me. I kissed his dear hand: O my generous, kind protector,\nsaid I, how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting mind of your\npoor servant! which apprehends nothing so much as her own unworthiness\nof the honour and blessing that await her!--He was pleased to say, I\nknow well, my dearest creature, that, according to the liberties we\npeople of fortune generally give ourselves, I have promised a great\ndeal, when I say so. But I would not have said it, if, deliberately,\nI could not with all my heart. So banish from your mind all doubt and\nuneasiness; let a generous confidence in me take place; and let me see\nit does, by your cheerfulness in this day's solemn business; and then I\nwill love you for ever!\n\nMay God Almighty, sir, said I, reward all your goodness to me!--That is\nall I can say. But, oh! how kind it is in you, to supply the want of the\npresence and comfortings of a dear mother, of a loving sister, or of the\nkind companions of my own sex, which most maidens have, to soothe their\nanxieties on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity!--You, sir,\nare all these tender relations in one to me! Your condescensions and\nkindness shall, if possible, embolden me to look up to you without\nthat sweet terror, that must confound poor bashful maidens, on such an\noccasion, when they are surrendered up to a more doubtful happiness, and\nto half-strange men, whose good faith, and good usage of them, must be\nless experienced, and is all involved in the dark bosom of futurity, and\nonly to be proved by the event.\n\nThis, my dear Pamela, said he, is most kindly said! It shews me that you\nenter gratefully into my intention. For I would, by my conduct, supply\nall these dear relations to you; and I voluntarily promise, from my\nheart, to you, what I think I could not, with such assured resolutions\nof performance, to the highest-born lady in the kingdom. For let me tell\nmy sweet girl, that, after having been long tossed by the boisterous\nwinds of a more culpable passion, I have now conquered it, and am not\nso much the victim of your beauty, all charming as you are, as of your\nvirtue; and therefore may more boldly promise for myself, having so\nstable a foundation for my affection; which, should this outward beauty\nfail, will increase with your virtue, and shine forth the brighter,\nas that is more illustriously displayed by the augmented opportunities\nwhich the condition you are now entering into will afford you.--O the\ndear charming man! how nobly, how encouragingly kind, was all this!\n\nI could not suitably express myself: And he said, I see my girl is at a\nloss for words! I doubt not your kind acceptance of my declarations. And\nwhen I have acted too much the part of a libertine formerly, for you\nto look back without some anxiety, I ought not, being now happily\nconvicted, to say less.--But why loses my girl her time? I will now only\nadd, that I hope for many happy years to make good, by my conduct, what\nso willingly flows from my lips.\n\nHe kissed me again, and said, But, whatever you do, Pamela, be cheerful;\nfor else, may be, of the small company we shall have, some one, not\nknowing how to account for your too nice modesty, will think there is\nsome other person in the world, whose addresses would be still more\nagreeable to you.\n\nThis he said with an air of sweetness and pleasantry; but it alarmed\nme exceedingly, and made me resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as\npossible. For this was, indeed, a most affecting expression, and enough\nto make me, if any thing can, behave as I ought, and to force my idle\nfears to give way to hopes so much better grounded.--And I began almost,\non this occasion, to wish Mr. Williams were not to marry me, lest I\nshould behave like a fool; and so be liable to an imputation, which I\nshould be most unworthy, if I deserved.\n\nSo I set about dressing me instantly; and he sent Mrs. Jewkes to assist\nme. But I am never long a dressing, when I set about it; and my master\nhas now given me a hint, that will, for half an hour more, at least,\nkeep my spirits in a brisk circulation. Yet it concerns me a little too,\nlest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt, that I am not, mind\nand person, entirely his.\n\nAnd so being now ready, and not called to breakfast, I sat down and\nwrote thus far.\n\nI might have mentioned, that I dressed myself in a rich white satin\nnight-gown, that had been my good lady's, and my best head-clothes, etc.\nI have got such a knack of writing, that when I am by myself, I cannot\nsit without a pen in my hand.--But I am now called to breakfast. I\nsuppose the gentlemen are come.--Now, courage, Pamela! Remember thou\nart upon thy good behaviour!--Fie upon it! my heart begins to flutter\nagain!--Foolish heart! be still! Never, sure, was any maiden's perverse\nheart under so little command as mine!--It gave itself away, at first,\nwithout my leave; it has been, for weeks, pressing me with its wishes;\nand yet now, when it should be happy itself, and make me so, it is\nthrob, throb, throb, like a little fool! and filling me with such\nunseasonable misgivings, as abate the rising comforts of all my better\nprospects.\n\n\nThursday, near three o'clock.\n\nI thought I should have found no time nor heart to write again this day.\nBut here are three gentlemen come, unexpectedly, to dine with my master;\nand so I shall not appear. He has done all he could, civilly, to send\nthem away; but they will stay, though I believe he had rather they would\nnot. And so I have nothing to do but to write till I go to dinner myself\nwith Mrs. Jewkes: for my master was not prepared for this company; and\nit will be a little latish to-day. So I will begin with my happy story\nwhere I left off.\n\nWhen I came down to breakfast, Mr. Peters and Mr. Williams were both\nthere. And as soon as my master heard me coming down, he met me at the\ndoor, and led me in with great tenderness. He had kindly spoken to them,\nas he told me afterwards, to mention no more of the matter to me, than\nneeds must. I paid my respects to them, I believe a little awkwardly,\nand was almost out of breath: but said, I had come down a little too\nfast.\n\nWhen Abraham came in to wait, my master said, (that the servants should\nnot mistrust,) 'Tis well, gentlemen, you came as you did; for my good\ngirl and I were going to take an airing till dinner-time. I hope you'll\nstay and dine with me. Sir, said Mr. Peters, we won't hinder your\nairing. I only came, having a little time upon my hands, to see your\nchapel; but must be at home at dinner; and Mr. Williams will dine with\nme. Well then, said my master, we will pursue our intention, and ride\nout for an hour or two, as soon as I have shewn Mr. Peters my little\nchapel. Will you, Pamela, after breakfast, walk with us to it? If,\nif, said I, and had like to have stammered, foolish that I was! if you\nplease, sir. I could look none of them in the face. Abraham looking at\nme; Why, child, said my master, you have hardly recovered your fright\nyet: how came your foot to slip? 'Tis well you did not hurt yourself.\nSaid Mr. Peters, improving the hint, You ha'n't sprained your ancle,\nmadam, I hope. No, sir, said I, I believe not; but 'tis a little painful\nto me. And so it was; for I meant my foolishness! Abraham, said my\nmaster, bid Robin put the horses to the coach, instead of the chariot;\nand if these gentlemen will go, we can set them down. No matter, sir,\nsaid Mr. Peters: I had as lieve walk, if Mr. Williams chooses it. Well\nthen, said my master, let it be the chariot, as I told him.\n\nI could eat nothing, though I attempted it; and my hand shook so, I\nspilled some of my chocolate, and so put it down again; and they were\nall very good, and looked another way. My master said, when Abraham was\nout, I have a quite plain ring here, Mr. Peters: And I hope the ceremony\nwill dignify the ring; and that I shall give my girl reason to think\nit, for that cause, the most valuable one that can be presented her. Mr.\nPeters said, He was sure I should value it more than the richest diamond\nin the world.\n\nI had bid Mrs. Jewkes not to dress herself, lest she should give cause\nof mistrust; and she took my advice.\n\nWhen breakfast was over, my master said, before Abraham, Well,\ngentlemen, we will step into the chapel; and you must give me your\nadvice, as to the alterations I design. I am in the more haste, because\nthe survey you are going to take of it, for the alterations, will take\nup a little time; and we shall have but a small space between that and\ndinner, for the little tour I design to make.--Pamela, you'll give us\nyour opinion, won't you? Yes, sir, said I; I'll come after you.\n\nSo they went out, and I sat down in the chair again, and fanned myself:\nI am sick at heart, said I, I think, Mrs. Jewkes. Said she, Shall\nI fetch you a little cordial?--No, said I, I am a sad fool! I want\nspirits, that's all. She took her smelling-bottle, and would have given\nit me: but I said, Keep it in your hand; may be I shall want it: but I\nhope not.\n\nShe gave me very good words, and begged me to go: And I got up; but my\nknees beat so against one another, I was forced to sit down again. But,\nat last, I held by her arm, and passing by Abraham, I said, This ugly\nslip, coming down stairs, has made me limp, though; so I must hold by\nyou, Mrs. Jewkes. Do you know what alterations there are to be in the\nchapel, that we must all give our opinions of them?\n\nNan, she told me, was let into the secret; and she had ordered her to\nstay at the chapel door, to see that nobody came in. My dear master came\nto me, at entering the chapel, and took my hand, and led me up to the\naltar. Remember, my dear girl, whispered he, and be cheerful. I am,\nI will, sir, said I; but I hardly knew what I said; and so you may\nbelieve, when I said to Mrs. Jewkes, Don't leave me; pray, Mrs. Jewkes,\ndon't leave me; as if I had all confidence in her, and none where it was\nmost due. So she kept close to me. God forgive me! but I never was so\nabsent in my life, as at first; even till Mr. Williams had gone on in\nthe service, so far as to the awful words about requiring us, as we\nshould answer at the dreadful day of judgment; and then the solemn\nwords, and my master's whispering, Mind this, my dear, made me start.\nSaid he, still whispering, Know you any impediment? I blushed, and said\nsoftly, None, sir, but my great unworthiness.\n\nThen followed the sweet words, Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded\nwife? etc. and I began to take heart a little, when my dearest master\nanswered, audibly, to this question, I will. But I could only make a\ncourtesy, when they asked me; though, I am sure, my heart was readier\nthan my speech, and answered to every article of obey, serve, love, and\nhonour.\n\nMr. Peters gave me away; and I said, after Mr. Williams, as well as\nI could, as my dear master did with a much better grace, the words of\nbetrothment; and the ceremony of the ring passing next, I received the\ndear favour at his worthy hands with a most grateful heart; and he was\npleased to say afterwards in the chariot, that when he had done saying,\nWith this ring I thee wed, etc. I made a courtesy, and said, Thank you,\nsir. May be I did; for I am sure it was a most grateful part of the\nservice, and my heart was overwhelmed with his goodness, and the tender\ngrace wherewith he performed it. I was very glad, that the next part\nwas the prayer, and kneeling; for I trembled so, I could hardly stand,\nbetwixt fear and joy.\n\nThe joining of our hands afterwards, the declaration of our being\nmarried to the few witnesses present; for, reckoning Nan, whose\ncuriosity would not let her stay at the door, there were but Mr. Peters,\nMrs. Jewkes, and she; the blessing, the psalm, and the subsequent\nprayers, and the concluding exhortation; were so many beautiful,\nwelcome, and lovely parts of this divine office, that my heart began to\nbe delighted with them; and my spirits to be a little freer.\n\nAnd thus, my dearest, dear parents, is your happy, happy, thrice happy\nPamela, at last married; and to whom?--Why, to her beloved, gracious\nmaster! the lord of her wishes! And thus the dear, once naughty assailer\nof her innocence, by a blessed turn of Providence, is become the kind,\nthe generous protector and rewarder of it. God be evermore blessed\nand praised! and make me not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent\nhonour!--And bless and reward the dear, dear, good gentleman, who has\nthus exalted his unworthy servant, and given her a place, which the\ngreatest ladies would think themselves happy in!\n\nMy master saluted me most ardently, and said, God give you, my dear\nlove, as much joy on this occasion, as I have! And he presented me to\nMr. Peters, who saluted me; and said, You may excuse me, dear madam,\nfor I gave you away, and you are my daughter. And Mr. Williams modestly\nwithdrawing a little way; Mr. Williams, said my master, pray accept my\nthanks, and wish your sister joy. So he saluted me too; and said, Most\nheartily, madam, I do. And I will say, that to see so much innocence and\nvirtue so eminently rewarded, is one of the greatest pleasures I have\never known. This my master took very kindly.\n\nMrs. Jewkes would have kissed my hand at the chapel-door; but I put my\narms about her neck, for I had got a new recruit of spirits just then;\nand kissed her, and said, Thank you, Mrs. Jewkes, for accompanying me. I\nhave behaved sadly. No, madam, said she, pretty well, pretty well!\n\nMr. Peters walked out with me; and Mr. Williams and my master came out\nafter us, talking together.\n\nMr. Peters, when we came into the parlour, said, I once more, madam,\nmust wish you joy on this happy occasion. I wish every day may add to\nyour comforts; and may you very long rejoice in one another! for you are\nthe loveliest couple I ever saw joined. I told him, I was highly obliged\nto his kind opinion, and good wishes; and hoped my future conduct would\nnot make me unworthy of them.\n\nMy good benefactor came in with Mr. Williams: So, my dear life, said he,\nhow do you do? A little more composed, I hope. Well, you see this is not\nso dreadful an affair as you apprehended.\n\nSir, said Mr. Peters, very kindly, it is a very solemn circumstance; and\nI love to see it so reverently and awfully entered upon. It is a most\nexcellent sign; for the most thoughtful beginnings make the most prudent\nproceedings.\n\nMrs. Jewkes, of her own accord, came in with a large silver tumbler,\nfilled with sack, and a toast, and nutmeg, and sugar; and my master\nsaid, That's well thought of, Mrs. Jewkes; for we have made but sorry\nbreakfasting. And he would make me, take some of the toast; as they all\ndid, and drank pretty heartily: and I drank a little, and it cheered my\nheart, I thought, for an hour after.\n\nMy master took a fine diamond ring from his finger, and presented it to\nMr. Peters, who received it very kindly. And to Mr. Williams he said,\nMy old acquaintance, I have reserved for you, against a variety of\nsolicitations, the living I always designed for you; and I beg you'll\nprepare to take possession of it; and as the doing it may be attended\nwith some expense, pray accept of this towards it; and so he gave him\n(as he told me afterwards it was) a bank note of 50l.\n\nSo did this generous good gentleman bless us all, and me in particular;\nfor whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had married one of the\nnoblest fortunes.\n\nSo he took his leave of the gentlemen, recommending secrecy again, for\na few days, and they left him; and none of the servants suspected any\nthing, as Mrs. Jewkes believes. And then I threw myself at his feet,\nblessed God, and blessed him for his goodness; and he overwhelmed me\nwith kindness, calling me his sweet bride, and twenty lovely epithets,\nthat swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance.\n\nHe afterwards led me to the chariot; and we took a delightful tour round\nthe neighbouring villages; and he did all he could to dissipate those\nstill perverse anxieties that dwell upon my mind, and, do what I can,\nspread too thoughtful an air, as he tells me, over my countenance.\n\nWe came home again by half an hour after one; and he was pleasing\nhimself with thinking, not to be an hour out of my company this blessed\nday, that (as he was so good as to say) he might inspire me with a\nfamiliarity that should improve my confidence in him, when he was told,\nthat a footman of Sir Charles Hargrave had been here, to let him know,\nthat his master, and two other gentlemen, were on the road to take a\ndinner with him, in their way to Nottingham.\n\nHe was heartily vexed at this, and said to me, He should have been\nglad of their companies at any other time; but that it was a barbarous\nintrusion now; and he wished they had been told he would not be at home\nat dinner: And besides, said he, they are horrid drinkers; and I shan't\nbe able to get them away to-night, perhaps; for they have nothing to do,\nbut to travel round the country, and beat up their friends' quarters all\nthe way; and it is all one to them, whether they stay a night or a month\nat a place. But, added he, I'll find some way, if I can, to turn them\noff, after dinner.--Confound them, said he, in a violent pet, that they\nshould come this day, of all the days in the year!\n\nWe had hardly alighted, and got in, before they came: Three mad rakes\nthey seemed to be, as I looked through the window, setting up a hunting\nnote, as soon as they came to the gate, that made the court-yard echo\nagain; and smacking their whips in concert.\n\nSo I went up to my chamber, and saw (what made my heart throb) Mrs.\nJewkes's officious pains to put the room in order for a guest, that,\nhowever welcome, as now my duty teaches me to say, is yet dreadful to me\nto think of. So I took refuge in my closet, and had recourse to pen and\nink, for my amusement, and to divert my anxiety of mind.--If one's\nheart is so sad, and one's apprehension so great, where one so extremely\nloves, and is so extremely obliged; what must be the case of those poor\nmaidens, who are forced, for sordid views, by their tyrannical parents\nor guardians, to marry the man they almost hate, and, perhaps, to the\nloss of the man they most love! O that is a sad thing, indeed!--And what\nhave not such cruel parents to answer for! And what do not such poor\ninnocent victims suffer!--But, blessed be God, this lot is far from\nbeing mine!\n\nMy good master (for I cannot yet have the presumption to call him by a\nmore tender name) came up to me, and said, Well, I just come to ask my\ndear bride (O the charming, charming word!) how she does? I see you are\nwriting, my dear, said he. These confounded rakes are half mad, I think,\nand will make me so! However, said he, I have ordered my chariot to be\ngot ready, as if I was under an engagement five miles off, and will set\nthem out of the house, if possible; and then ride round, and come back,\nas soon as I can get rid of them. I find, said he, Lady Davers is full\nof our affairs. She has taken great freedoms with me before Sir Charles;\nand they have all been at me, without mercy; and I was forced to be very\nserious with them, or else they would have come up to have seen you,\nsince I would not call you down.--He kissed me, and said, I shall\nquarrel with them, if I can't get them away; for I have lost two or\nthree precious hours with my soul's delight: And so he went down.\n\nMrs. Jewkes asked me to walk down to dinner in the little parlour. I\nwent down, and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at\ntable; and would not be persuaded, without difficulty, to sit down\nwith me. But I insisted she should: For, said I, it would be very\nextraordinary, if one should so soon go into such distance, Mrs.\nJewkes.--Whatever my new station may require of me, added I, I hope I\nshall always conduct myself in such a manner, that pride and insolence\nshall bear no part in my character.\n\nYou are very good, madam, said she; but I will always know my duty to\nmy master's lady.--Why then, replied I, if I must take state upon me so\nearly, Mrs. Jewkes, let me exact from you what you call your duty; and\nsit down with me when I desire you.\n\nThis prevailed upon her; and I made shift to get down a bit of\napple-pye, and a little custard; but that was all.\n\nMy good master came in again, and said, Well, thank my stars! these\nrakes are going now; but I must set out with them, and I choose my\nchariot; for if I took horse, I should have difficulty to part with\nthem; for they are like a snowball, and intend to gather company as they\ngo, to make a merry tour of it for some days together.\n\nWe both got up, when he came in: Fie, Pamela! said he; why this ceremony\nnow?--Sit still, Mrs. Jewkes.--Nay, sir, said she, I was loath to sit\ndown; but my lady would have me.--She is very right, Mrs. Jewkes, said\nmy master, and tapped me on the cheek; for we are but yet half married;\nand so she is not above half your lady yet!--Don't look so down, don't\nbe so silent, my dearest, said he; why, you hardly spoke twenty words\nto me all the time we were out together. Something I will allow for your\nbashful sweetness; but not too much.--Mrs. Jewkes, have you no pleasant\ntales to tell my Pamela, to make her smile, till I return?--Yes, sir,\nsaid she, I could tell twenty pleasant stories; but my lady is too nice\nto hear them; and yet, I hope, I should not be shocking neither. Ah!\npoor woman! thought I; thy chastest stories will make a modest person\nblush, if I know thee! and I desire to hear none of them.\n\nMy master said, Tell her one of the shortest you have, in my hearing.\nWhy, sir, said she, I knew a bashful young lady, as madam may be,\nmarried to--Dear Mrs. Jewkes, interrupted I, no more of your story, I\nbeseech you; I don't like the beginning of it. Go on, Mrs. Jewkes, said\nmy master. No, pray, sir, don't require it, said I, pray don't. Well,\nsaid he, then we'll have it another time, Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nAbraham coming in to tell him the gentlemen were going, and that his\nchariot was ready; I am glad of that, said he; and went to them, and set\nout with them.\n\nI took a turn in the garden with Mrs. Jewkes, after they were gone: And\nhaving walked a while, I said, I should be glad of her company down the\nelm-walk, to meet the chariot: For, O! I know not how to look up at him,\nwhen he is with me; nor how to bear his absence, when I have reason to\nexpect him: What a strange contradiction there is in this unaccountable\npassion.\n\nWhat a different aspect every thing in and about this house bears now,\nto my thinking, to what it once had! The garden, the pond, the alcove,\nthe elm-walk. But, oh! my prison is become my palace; and no wonder\nevery thing wears another face!\n\nWe sat down upon the broad stile, leading towards the road; and Mrs.\nJewkes was quite another person to me, to what she was the last time I\nsat there.\n\nAt last my best beloved returned, and alighted there. What, my Pamela!\n(and Mrs. Jewkes then left me,) What (said he, and kissed me) brings\nyou this way? I hope to meet me.--Yes, sir, said I. That's kind, indeed,\nsaid he; but why that averted eye?--that downcast countenance, as if you\nwas afraid of me? You must not think so, sir, said I. Revive my heart\nthen, said he, with a more cheerful aspect; and let that over-anxious\nsolicitude, which appears in the most charming face in the world, be\nchased from it.--Have you, my dear girl any fears that I can dissipate;\nany doubts that I can obviate; any hopes that I can encourage; any\nrequest that I can gratify?--Speak, my dear Pamela; and if I have power,\nbut speak, and to purchase one smile, it shall be done!\n\nI cannot, sir, said I, have any fears, any doubts, but that I shall\nnever be able to deserve all your goodness. I have no hopes, but that\nmy future conduct may be agreeable to you, and my determined duty well\naccepted. Nor have I any request to make, but that you will forgive all\nmy imperfections and, among the rest, this foolish weakness, that makes\nme seem to you, after all the generous things that have passed, to want\nthis further condescension, and these kind assurances. But indeed, sir,\nI am oppressed by your bounty; my spirits sink under the weight of it;\nand the oppression is still the greater, as I see not how, possibly,\nin my whole future life, by all I can do, to merit the least of your\nfavours.\n\nI know your grateful heart, said he; but remember, my dear, what the\nlawyers tell us, That marriage is the highest consideration which the\nlaw knows. And this, my sweet bride, has made you mine, and me yours;\nand you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with me.\nBut, set that consideration aside, what is the obligation you have to\nme? Your mind is pure as that of an angel, and as much transcends mine.\nYour wit, and your judgment, to make you no compliment, are more than\nequal to mine: You have all the graces that education can give a woman,\nimproved by a genius which makes those graces natural to you. You have\na sweetness of temper, and a noble sincerity, beyond all comparison; and\nin the beauty of your person, you excel all the ladies I ever saw. Where\nthen, my dearest, is the obligation, if not on my side to you?--But, to\navoid these comparisons, let us talk of nothing henceforth but equality;\nalthough, if the riches of your mind, and your unblemished virtue, be\nset against my fortune, (which is but an accidental good, as I may call\nit, and all I have to boast of,) the condescension will be yours; and\nI shall not think I can possibly deserve you, till, after your sweet\nexample, my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours.\n\nO, sir, said I, what comfort do you give me, that, instead of my being\nin danger of being ensnared by the high condition to which your goodness\nhas exalted me, you make me hope, that I shall be confirmed and approved\nby you; and that we may have a prospect of perpetuating each other's\nhappiness, till time shall be no more!--But, sir, I will not, as you\nonce cautioned me, be too serious. I will resolve, with these sweet\nencouragements, to be, in every thing, what you would have me be: And I\nhope I shall, more and more, shew you that I have no will but yours. He\nkissed me very tenderly, and thanked me for this kind assurance, as he\ncalled it.\n\nAnd so we entered the house together.\n\n\nEight o'clock at night.\n\nNow these sweet assurances, my dear father and mother, you will say,\nmust be very consolatory to me; and being voluntary on his side, were\nall that could be wished for on mine; and I was resolved, if possible,\nto subdue my idle fears and apprehensions.\n\n\nTen o'clock at night.\n\nAs we sat at supper, he was generously kind to me, as well in his\nactions, as expressions. He took notice, in the most delicate manner, of\nmy endeavour to conquer my foibles; and said, I see, with pleasure, my\ndear girl strives to comport herself in a manner suitable to my wishes:\nI see, even through the sweet tender struggles of your over-nice\nmodesty, how much I owe to your intentions of obliging me. As I have\nonce told you, that I am the conquest more of your virtue than your\nbeauty; so not one alarming word or look shall my beloved Pamela hear or\nsee, to give her reason to suspect the truth of what I aver. You may\nthe rather believe me, continued he, as you may see the pain I have\nto behold any thing that concerns you, even though your concern be\ncauseless. And yet I will indulge my dear girl's bashful weakness so\nfar, as to own, that so pure a mind may suffer from apprehension, on so\nimportant a change as this; and I can therefore be only displeased with\nsuch part of your conduct, as may make your sufferings greater than my\nown; when I am resolved, through every stage of my future life, in all\nevents, to study to make them less.\n\nAfter supper, of which, with all his sweet persuasions, I could hardly\ntaste, he made me drink two glasses of champaign, and, afterwards, a\nglass of sack; which he kindly forced upon me, by naming your healths:\nand as the time of retiring drew on, he took notice, but in a very\ndelicate manner, how my colour went and came, and how foolishly I\ntrembled. Nobody, surely, in such delightful circumstances, ever behaved\nso silly!--And he said, My dearest girl, I fear you have had too much\nof my company for so many hours together; and would better recollect\nyourself, if you retired for half an hour to your closet.\n\nI wished for this, but durst not say so much, lest he should be angry;\nfor, as the hours grew on, I found my apprehensions increase, and my\nsilly heart was the unquieter, every time I could lift up my eyes to\nhis dear face; so sweetly terrible did he appear to my apprehensions. I\nsaid, You are all goodness, dear sir; and I boldly kissed his dear\nhand, and pressed it to my lips with both mine. And saluting me very\nfervently, he gave me his hand, seeing me hardly able to stand, and led\nme to my chamber-door, and then most generously withdrew.\n\nI went to my closet; and the first thing I did, on my knees, again\nthanked God for the blessing of the day; and besought his divine\ngoodness to conduct my future life in such a manner, as should make me\na happy instrument of his glory. After this, being now left to my own\nrecollection, I grew a little more assured and lightsome; and the pen\nand paper being before me, I amused myself with writing thus far.\n\n\nEleven o'clock Thursday night.\n\nMrs. Jewkes being come up with a message, desiring to know, whether\nher master may attend upon me in my closet; and hinting to me, that,\nhowever, she believed he did not expect to find me there; I have sent\nword, that I beg he would indulge me one quarter of an hour.--So,\ncommitting myself to the mercies of the Almighty, who has led me through\nso many strange scenes of terror and affrightment, to this happy, yet\nawful moment, I will wish you, my dear parents, a good night; and though\nyou will not see this in time, yet I know I have your hourly prayers,\nand therefore cannot fail of them now. So, good night, good night! God\nbless you, and God bless me! Amen, amen, if it be his blessed will,\nsubscribes\n\n                                            Your ever-dutiful DAUGHTER!\n\n\nFriday evening.\n\nO how this dear excellent man indulges me in every thing! Every hour he\nmakes me happier, by his sweet condescension, than the former. He pities\nmy weakness of mind, allows for all my little foibles, endeavours to\ndissipate my fears; his words are so pure, his ideas so chaste, and his\nwhole behaviour so sweetly decent, that never, surely, was so happy a\ncreature as your Pamela! I never could have hoped such a husband could\nhave fallen to my lot: and much less, that a gentleman, who had allowed\nhimself in attempts, that now I will endeavour to forget for ever,\nshould have behaved with so very delicate and unexceptionable a\ndemeanour. No light frothy jests drop from his lips; no alarming\nrailleries; no offensive expressions, nor insulting airs, reproach or\nwound the ears of your happy, thrice happy daughter. In short, he says\nevery thing that may embolden me to look up, with pleasure, upon the\ngenerous author of my happiness.\n\nAt breakfast, when I knew not how to see him, he emboldened me by\ntalking of you, my dear parents; a subject, he generously knew, I could\ntalk of: and gave me assurances, that he would make you both happy.\nHe said, He would have me send you a letter to acquaint you with my\nnuptials; and, as he could make business that way, Thomas should carry\nit purposely, as to-morrow. Nor will I, said he, my dear Pamela, desire\nto see your writings, because I told you I would not; for now I will, in\nevery thing, religiously keep my word with my dear spouse: (O the dear\ndelightful word!) and you may send all your papers to them, from those\nthey have, down to this happy moment; only let me beg they will preserve\nthem, and let me have them when they have read them; as also those I\nhave not seen; which, however, I desire not to see till then; but then\nshall take it for a favour, if you will grant it.\n\nIt will be my pleasure, as well as my duty, sir, said I, to obey you\nin every thing: and I will write up to the conclusion of this day, that\nthey may see how happy you have made me.\n\nI know you will both join with me to bless God for his wonderful mercies\nand goodness to you, as well as to me: For he was pleased to ask me\nparticularly after your circumstances, and said, He had taken notice,\nthat I had hinted, in some of my first letters, that you owed money in\nthe world; and he gave me fifty guineas, and bid me send them to you\nin my packet, to pay your debts, as far as they would go; and that you\nwould quit your present business, and put yourself, and my dear mother,\ninto a creditable appearance; and he would find a better place of abode\nfor you than that you had, when he returned to Bedfordshire. O how shall\nI bear all these exceeding great and generous favours!--I send them\nwrapt up, five guineas in a parcel, in double papers.\n\nTo me he gave no less than one hundred guineas more; and said, I would\nhave you, my dear, give Mrs. Jewkes, when you go away from hence, what\nyou think fit out of these, as from yourself.--Nay, good dear sir, said\nI, let that be what you please. Give her, then, said he, twenty guineas,\nas a compliment on your nuptials. Give Colbrand ten guineas give: the\ntwo coachmen five guineas each; to the two maids at this house five\nguineas each; give Abraham five guineas; give Thomas five guineas; and\ngive the gardeners, grooms, and helpers, twenty guineas among them. And\nwhen, said he, I return with you to the other house, I will make you a\nsuitable present, to buy you such ornaments as are fit for my beloved\nwife to appear in. For now, my Pamela, continued he, you are not to\nmind, as you once proposed, what other ladies will say; but to appear as\nmy wife ought to do. Else it would look as if what you thought of, as\na means to avoid the envy of others of your sex, was a wilful slight\nin me, which, I hope, I never shall be guilty of; and I will shew the\nworld, that I value you as I ought, and as if I had married the first\nfortune in the kingdom: And why should it not be so, when I know none of\nthe first quality that matches you in excellence?\n\nHe saw I was at a loss for words, and said, I see, my dearest bride! my\nspouse! my wife! my Pamela! your grateful confusion. And kissing me, as\nI was going to speak, I will stop your dear mouth, said he: You shall\nnot so much as thank me; for when I have done ten times more than this,\nI shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind, and\nloveliness of person; which thus, said he, and clasped me to his\ngenerous bosom, I can proudly now call my own!--O how, my dear parents,\ncan I think of any thing, but redoubled love, joy, and gratitude!\n\nAnd thus generously did he banish from my mind those painful\nreflections, and bashful apprehensions, that made me dread to see\nhim for the first time this day, when I was called to attend him at\nbreakfast; and made me all ease, composure, and tranquillity.\n\nHe then, thinking I seemed somewhat thoughtful, proposed a little turn\nin the chariot till dinner-time: And this was another sweet relief\nto me; and he diverted me with twenty agreeable relations, of what\nobservations he had made in his travels; and gave me the characters of\nthe ladies and gentlemen in his other neighbourhood; telling me whose\nacquaintance he would have me most cultivate. And when I mentioned Lady\nDavers with apprehension, he said, To be sure I love my sister dearly,\nnotwithstanding her violent spirit; and I know she loves me; and I can\nallow a little for her pride, because I know what my own so lately was;\nand because she knows not my Pamela, and her excellencies, as I do.\nBut you must not, my dear, forget what belongs to your character, as\nmy wife, nor meanly stoop to her; though I know you will choose, by\nsoftness, to try to move her to a proper behaviour. But it shall be my\npart to see, that you do not yield too much.\n\nHowever, continued he, as I would not publicly declare my marriage here,\nI hope she won't come near us till we are in Bedfordshire; and then,\nwhen she knows we are married, she will keep away, if she is not willing\nto be reconciled; for she dares not, surely, come to quarrel with me,\nwhen she knows it is done; for that would have a hateful and wicked\nappearance, as if she would try to make differences between man and\nwife.--But we will have no more of this subject, nor talk of any thing,\nadded he, that shall give concern to my dearest. And so he changed the\ntalk to a more pleasing subject, and said the kindest and most soothing\nthings in the world.\n\nWhen we came home, which was about dinner-time, he was the same\nobliging, kind gentleman; and, in short, is studious to shew, on every\noccasion, his generous affection to me. And, after dinner, he told\nme, he had already written to his draper, in town, to provide him new\nliveries; and to his late mother's mercer, to send him down patterns of\nthe most fashionable silks, for my choice. I told him, I was unable to\nexpress my gratitude for his favours and generosity: And as he knew best\nwhat befitted his own rank and condition, I would wholly remit myself\nto his good pleasure. But, by all his repeated bounties to me, of so\nextraordinary a nature, I could not but look forward with awe upon the\ncondition to which he had exalted me; and now I feared I should hardly\nbe able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he\nhad condescended to make: But that, I hoped, I should have not only his\ngenerous allowance for my imperfections, which I could only assure him\nshould not be wilful ones, but his kind instructions; and that as often\nas he observed any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely\napprove, he would let me know it; and I would think his reproofs of\nbeginning faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the world\nbecause they would keep me from committing greater; and be a means to\ncontinue to me the blessing of his good opinion.\n\nHe answered me in the kindest manner; and assured me, That nothing\nshould ever lie upon his mind which he would not reveal, and give me an\nopportunity either of convincing him, or being convinced myself.\n\nHe then asked me, When I should be willing to go to the Bedfordshire\nhouse? I said, whenever he pleased. We will come down hither again\nbefore the winter, said he, if you please, in order to cultivate the\nacquaintance you have begun with Lady Jones, and Sir Simon's family;\nand, if it please God to spare us to one another, in the winter I will\ngive you, as I promised for two or three months, the diversions of\nLondon. And I think, added he, if my dear pleases, we will set out next\nweek, about Tuesday, for t'other house. I can have no objection, sir,\nsaid I, to any thing you propose; but how will you avoid Miss Darnford's\nsolicitation for an evening to dance? Why, said he, we can make Monday\nevening do for that purpose, if they won't excuse us. But, if you\nplease, said he, I will invite Lady Jones, Mr. Peters and his family,\nand Sir Simon and his family, to my little chapel, on Sunday morning,\nand to stay dinner with me; and then I will declare my marriage to them,\nbecause my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason\nfor a possibility of any body's doubting that it is so. O! how good\nwas this! But, indeed, his conduct is all of a piece, noble, kind, and\nconsiderate! What a happy creature am I!--And then, may be, said he,\nthey will excuse us till we return into this country again, as to the\nball. Is there any thing, added he, that my beloved Pamela has still to\nwish? If you have, freely speak.\n\nHitherto, my dearest sir, replied I, you have not only prevented my\nwishes, but my hopes, and even my thoughts. And yet I must own, since\nyour kind command of speaking my mind seems to shew, that you expect\nfrom me I should say something; that I have only one or two things to\nwish more, and then I shall be too happy. Say, said he, what they are.\nSir, proceeded I, I am, indeed, ashamed to ask any thing, lest it should\nnot be agreeable to you; and lest it should look as if I was taking\nadvantage of your kind condescensions to me, and knew not when to be\nsatisfied!\n\nI will only tell you, Pamela, said he, that you are not to imagine,\nthat these things, which I have done, in hopes of obliging you, are the\nsudden impulses of a new passion for you. But, if I can answer for my\nown mind, they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of obliging\nyou: which, I hope, will last as long as your merit lasts; and that, I\nmake no doubt, will be as long as I live. And I can the rather answer\nfor this, because I really find so much delight in myself in my present\nway of thinking and acting, as infinitely overpays me; and which, for\nthat reason, I am likely to continue, for both our sakes. My beloved\nwife, therefore, said he, for methinks I am grown fond of a name I once\ndespised, may venture to speak her mind; and I will promise, that, so\nfar as it is agreeable to me, and I cheerfully can, I will comply; and\nyou will not insist upon it, if that should not be the case.\n\nTo be sure, sir, said I, I ought not, neither will I. And now you\nembolden me to become an humble petitioner, and that, as I ought, upon\nmy knees, for the reinstating such of your servants, as I have been the\nunhappy occasion of their disobliging you. He raised me up, and said,\nMy beloved Pamela has too often been in this suppliant posture to me,\nto permit it any more. Rise, my fairest, and let me know whom, in\nparticular, you would reinstate; and he kindly held me in his arms, and\npressed me to his beloved bosom. Mrs. Jervis, sir, said I, in the first\nplace; for she is a good woman; and the misfortunes she has had in the\nworld, must make your displeasure most heavy to her.\n\nWell, said he, who next? Mr. Longman, sir, said I; and I am sure, kind\nas they have been to me, yet would I not ask it, if I could not vouch\nfor their integrity, and if I did not think it was my dear master's\ninterest to have such good servants.\n\nHave you any thing further? said he.--Sir, said I, your good old butler,\nwho has so long been in your family before the day of your happy birth,\nI would, if I might, become an advocate for!\n\nWell, said he, I have only to say, That had not Mr. Longman and Mrs.\nJervis, and Jonathan too, joined in a body, in a bold appeal to Lady\nDavers, which has given her the insolent handle she has taken to\nintermeddle in my affairs, I could easily have forgiven all the rest of\ntheir conduct; though they have given their tongues no little license\nabout me: But I could have forgiven them, because I desire every body\nshould admire you; and it is with pride that I observe not only their\nopinion and love, but that of every body else that knows you, justify my\nown.--But yet, I will forgive even this, because my Pamela desires it;\nand I will send a letter myself, to tell Longman what he owes to your\ninterposition, if the estate he has made in my family does not set him\nabove the acceptance of it. And, as to Mrs. Jervis, do you, my dear,\nwrite a letter to her, and give her your commands, instantly, on, the\nreceipt of it, to go and take possession of her former charge; for now,\nmy dearest girl, she will be more immediately your servant; and I know\nyou love her so well, that you'll go thither with the more pleasure to\nfind her there.--But don't think, added he, that all this compliance is\nto be for nothing. Ah, sir! said I, tell me but what I can do, poor as\nI am in power, but rich in will; and I will not hesitate one moment. Why\nthen, said he, of your own accord, reward me for my cheerful compliance,\nwith one sweet kiss--I instantly said, Thus, then, dear sir, will I\nobey; and, oh! you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world,\nto make that a condition, which gives me double honour, and adds to\nmy obligations. And so I clasped my arms about his neck, and was not\nashamed to kiss him once and twice, and three times; once for every\nforgiven person.\n\nNow, my dearest Pamela, said he, what other things have you to ask? Mr.\nWilliams is already taken care of; and, I hope, will be happy.--Have you\nnothing to say for John Arnold?\n\nWhy, dear sir, said I, you have seen the poor fellow's penitence in my\nletters.--Yes, my dear, so I have; but that is his penitence for his\nhaving served me against you; and, I think, when he would have betrayed\nme afterwards, he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either.\n\nBut, dear sir, said I, this is a day of jubilee; and the less he\ndeserves, poor fellow, the more will be your goodness. And let me add\none word; That as he was divided in his inclinations between his duty to\nyou and good wishes to me, and knew not how to distinguish between the\none and the other, when he finds us so happily united by your great\ngoodness to me, he will have no more puzzles in his duty; for he has not\nfailed in any other part of it; but, I hope, will serve you faithfully\nfor the future.\n\nWell, then, suppose I put Mrs. Jewkes in a good way of business, in some\ninn, and give her John for a husband? And then your gipsy story will be\nmade out, that she will have a husband younger than herself.\n\nYou are all goodness, sir, said I. I can freely forgive poor Mrs.\nJewkes, and wish her happy. But permit me, sir, to ask, Would not this\nlook like a very heavy punishment to poor John? and as if you could not\nforgive him, when you are so generous to every body else?\n\nHe smiled and said, O my Pamela, this, for a forgiving spirit, is very\nsevere upon poor Jewkes: But I shall never, by the grace of God, have\nany more such trying services, to put him or the rest upon; and if you\ncan forgive him, I think I may: and so John shall be at your disposal.\nAnd now let me know what my Pamela has further to wish?\n\nO, my dearest sir, said I, not a single wish more has your grateful\nPamela! My heart is overwhelmed with your goodness! Forgive these tears\nof joy, added I: You have left me nothing to pray for, but that God\nwill bless you with life, and health, and honour, and continue to me the\nblessing of your esteem; and I shall then be the happiest creature in\nthe world.\n\nHe clasped me in his arms, and said, You cannot, my dear life, be so\nhappy in me, as I am in you. O how heartily I despise all my former\npursuits, and headstrong appetites! What joys, what true joys, flow from\nvirtuous love! joys which the narrow soul of the libertine cannot take\nin, nor his thoughts conceive! And which I myself, whilst a libertine,\nhad not the least notion of!\n\nBut, said he, I expected my dear spouse, my Pamela, had something to ask\nfor herself. But since all her own good is absorbed in the delight her\ngenerous heart takes in promoting that of others, it shall be my study\nto prevent her wishes, and to make her care for herself unnecessary, by\nmy anticipating kindness.\n\nIn this manner, my dear parents, is your happy daughter blessed in a\nhusband! O how my exulting heart leaps at the dear, dear word!--And I\nhave nothing to do, but to be humble, and to look up with gratitude to\nthe all-gracious dispenser of these blessings.\n\nSo, with a thousand thanks, I afterwards retired to my closet, to write\nyou thus far. And having completed what I purpose for this packet, and\nput up the kind obliging present, I have nothing more to say, but that\nI hope soon to see you both, and receive your blessings on this happy,\nthrice happy occasion. And so, hoping for your prayers, that I may\npreserve an humble and upright mind to my gracious God, a dutiful\ngratitude to my dear master and husband--that I may long rejoice in the\ncontinuance of these blessings and favours, and that I may preserve,\nat the same time, an obliging deportment to every one else, I conclude\nmyself, Your ever-dutiful and most happy daughter,\n\n                                                        PAMELA B----\n\nO think it not my pride, my dear parents, that sets me on glorying in my\nchange of name! Yours will be always dear to me, and what I shall never\nbe ashamed of, I'm sure: But yet--for such a husband!--What shall I say,\nsince words are too faint to express my gratitude and my joy!\n\nI have taken copies of my master's letter to Mr. Longman, and mine to\nMrs. Jervis, which I will send with the further occurrences, when I go\nto the other dear house, or give you when I see you, as I now hope soon\nto do.\n\n\nSaturday morning, the third of my happy nuptials.\n\nI must still write on, till I come to be settled in the duty of the\nstation to which I am so generously exalted, and to let you participate\nwith me the transporting pleasures that rise from my new condition, and\nthe favours that are hourly heaped upon me by the best of husbands. When\nI had got my packet for you finished, I then set about writing, as he\nhad kindly directed me, to Mrs. Jervis; and had no difficulty till\nI came to sign my name; and so I brought it down with me, when I was\ncalled to supper, unsigned.\n\nMy good master (for I delight, and always shall, to call him by that\nname) had been writing to Mr. Longman; and he said, pleasantly, See,\nhere, my dearest, what I have written to your Somebody. I read as\nfollows:\n\n\n'Mr. LONGMAN,\n\n'I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that last Thursday I was married\nto my beloved Pamela. I have had reason to be disobliged with you, and\nMrs. Jervis and Jonathan, not for your kindness to, and regard for, my\ndear spouse, that now is, but for the manner, in which you appealed to\nmy sister Davers; which has made a very wide breach between her and me.\nBut as it was one of her first requests, that I would overlook what had\npassed, and reinstate you in all your former charges, I think myself\nobliged, without the least hesitation, to comply with it. So, if\nyou please, you may enter again upon an office which you have always\nexecuted with unquestionable integrity, and to the satisfaction of\n'Yours etc.'\n\n'Friday afternoon.'\n\n'I shall set out next Tuesday or Wednesday for Bedfordshire; and desire\nto find Jonathan, as well as you, in your former offices; in which,\nI dare say, you'll have the more pleasure, as you have such an early\ninstance of the sentiments of my dear wife, from whose goodness you may\nexpect every agreeable thing. She writes herself to Mrs. Jervis.'\n\n\nI thanked him most gratefully for his goodness; and afterwards took the\nabove copy of it; and shewed him my letter to Mrs. Jervis, as follows:\n\n\n'My DEAR MRS. JERVIS,\n\n'I have joyful tidings to communicate to you. For yesterday I was\nhappily married to the best of gentlemen, yours and my beloved master.\nI have only now to tell you, that I am inexpressibly happy: that my\ngenerous benefactor denies me nothing, and even anticipates my wishes.\nYou may be sure I could not forget my dear Mrs. Jervis; and I made it my\nrequest, and had it granted, as soon as asked, that you might return\nto the kind charge, which you executed with so much advantage to our\nmaster's interest, and so much pleasure to all under your direction. All\nthe power that is put into my hands, by the most generous of men, shall\nbe exerted to make every thing easy and agreeable to you: And as I shall\nsoon have the honour of attending my beloved to Bedfordshire, it will\nbe a very considerable addition to my delight, and to my unspeakable\nobligations to the best of men, to see my dear Mrs. Jervis, and to be\nreceived by her with that pleasure, which I promise myself from her\naffection. For I am, my dear good friend, and always will be,\n\n                   'Yours, very affectionately, and gratefully,\n                                                        PAMELA ----.'\n\n\nHe read this letter, and said, 'Tis yours, my dear, and must be good:\nBut don't you put your name to it? Sir, said I, your goodness has given\nme a right to a very honourable one but as this is the first occasion of\nthe kind, except that to my dear father and mother, I think I ought to\nshew it you unsigned, that I may not seem over-forward to take advantage\nof the honour you have done me.\n\nHowever sweetly humble and requisite, said he, this may appear to my\ndear Pamela's niceness, it befits me to tell you, that I am every moment\nmore and more pleased with the right you have to my name: and, my dear\nlife, added he, I have only to wish I may be half as worthy as you are\nof the happy knot so lately knit. He then took a pen himself, and\nwrote, after Pamela, his most worthy sirname; and I under-wrote thus:\n'O rejoice with me, my dear Mrs. Jervis, that I am enabled, by God's\ngraciousness, and my dear master's goodness, thus to write myself!'\n\nThese letters, and the packet to you, were sent away by Mr. Thomas early\nthis morning.\n\n\nMy dearest master is just gone to take a ride out, and intends to call\nupon Lady Jones, Mr. Peters, and Sir Simon Darnford, to invite them\nto chapel and dinner to-morrow; and says, he chooses to do it himself,\nbecause the time is so short, they will, perhaps, deny a servant.\n\nI forgot to mention, that Mr. Williams was here yesterday, to ask leave\nto go to see his new living, and to provide for taking possession of it;\nand seemed so pleased with my master's kindness and fondness for me, as\nwell as his generous deportment to himself, that he left us in such a\ndisposition, as shewed he was quite happy. I am very glad of it; for it\nwould rejoice me to be an humble means of making all mankind so: And oh!\nwhat returns ought I not to make to the divine goodness! and how ought\nI to strive to diffuse the blessings I experience, to all in my\nknowledge!--For else, what is it for such a worm as I to be exalted!\nWhat is my single happiness, if I suffer it, niggard-like, to extend no\nfarther than to myself?--But then, indeed, do God Almighty's creatures\nact worthy of the blessings they receive, when they make, or endeavour\nto make, the whole creation, so far as is in the circle of their power,\nhappy!\n\nGreat and good God! as thou hast enlarged my opportunities, enlarge also\nmy will, and make me delight in dispensing to others a portion of that\nhappiness, which I have myself so plentifully received at the hand\nof thy gracious Providence! Then shall I not be useless in my\ngeneration!--Then shall I not stand a single mark of thy goodness to a\npoor worthless creature, that in herself is of so small account in the\nscale of beings, a mere cipher on the wrong side of a figure; but shall\nbe placed on the right side; and, though nothing worth in myself, shall\ngive signification by my place, and multiply the blessings I owe to thy\ngoodness, which has distinguished me by so fair a lot!\n\nThis, as I conceive, is the indispensable duty of a high condition; and\nhow great must be the condemnation of poor creatures, at the great day\nof account, when they shall be asked, What uses they have made of the\nopportunities put into their hands? and are able only to say, We have\nlived but to ourselves: We have circumscribed all the power thou hast\ngiven us into one narrow, selfish, compass: We have heaped up treasures\nfor those who came after us, though we knew not whether they would not\nmake a still worse use of them than we ourselves did! And how can such\npoor selfish pleaders expect any other sentence, than the dreadful,\nDepart, ye cursed!\n\nBut sure, my dear father and mother, such persons can have no notion\nof the exalted pleasures that flow from doing good, were there to be no\nafter-account at all!\n\nThere is something so satisfactory and pleasing to reflect on the being\nable to administer comfort and relief to those who stand in need of it,\nas infinitely, of itself, rewards the beneficent mind. And how\noften have I experienced this in my good lady's time, though but the\nsecond-hand dispenser of her benefits to the poor and sickly, when she\nmade me her almoner!--How have I been affected with the blessings which\nthe miserable have heaped upon her for her goodness, and upon me for\nbeing but the humble conveyer of her bounty to them!--And how delighted\nhave I been, when the moving report I have made of a particular\ndistress, has augmented my good lady's first intentions in relief of it!\n\nThis I recall with pleasure, because it is now, by the divine goodness,\nbecome my part to do those good things she was wont to do: And oh! let\nme watch myself, that my prosperous state do not make me forget to look\nup, with due thankfulness, to the Providence which has entrusted me\nwith the power, that so I may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or\nneglect of it!\n\nForgive me these reflections, my dear parents; and let me have your\nprayers, that I may not find my present happiness a snare to me; but\nthat I may consider, that more and more will be expected from me, in\nproportion to the power given me; and that I may not so unworthily act,\nas if I believed I ought to set up my rest in my mean self, and think\nnothing further to be done, with the opportunities put into my hand, by\nthe divine favour, and the best of men!\n\n\nSaturday, seven o'clock in the evening.\n\nMy master returned home to dinner, in compliment to me, though much\npressed to dine with Lady Jones, as he was, also, by Sir Simon, to dine\nwith him. But Mr. Peters could not conveniently provide a preacher for\nhis own church tomorrow morning, at so short a notice; Mr. Williams\nbeing gone, as I said, to his new living; but believed he could for the\nafternoon; and so he promised to give us his company to dinner, and to\nread afternoon service: and this made my master invite all the rest, as\nwell as him, to dinner, and not to church; and he made them promise\nto come; and told Mr. Peters, he would send his coach for him and his\nfamily.\n\nMiss Darnford told him pleasantly, She would not come, unless he would\npromise to let her be at his wedding; by which I find Mr. Peters has\nkept the secret, as my master desired.\n\nHe was pleased to give me an airing after dinner in the chariot, and\nrenewed his kind assurances to me, and, if possible, is kinder than\never. This is sweetly comfortable to me, because it shews me he does not\nrepent of his condescensions to me; and it encourages me to look up to\nhim with more satisfaction of mind, and less doubtfulness.\n\nI begged leave to send a guinea to a poor body in the town, that I\nheard, by Mrs. Jewkes, lay very ill, and was very destitute. He said,\nSend two, my dear, if you please. Said I, Sir, I will never do any thing\nof this kind without letting you know what I do. He most generously\nanswered, I shall then, perhaps, have you do less good than you would\notherwise do, from a doubt of me; though, I hope, your discretion, and\nmy own temper, which is not avaricious, will make such doubt causeless.\n\nNow, my dear, continued he, I'll tell you how we will order this point,\nto avoid even the shadow of uneasiness on one side, or doubt on the\nother.\n\nAs to your father and mother, in the first place, they shall be quite\nout of the question; for I have already determined in my mind about\nthem; and it is thus: They shall go down, if they and you think well of\nit, to my little Kentish estate; which I once mentioned to you in such\na manner, as made you reject it with a nobleness of mind, that gave me\npain then, but pleasure since. There is a pretty little farm, and house,\nuntenanted, upon that estate, and tolerably well stocked, and I will\nfurther stock it for them; for such industrious folks won't know how\nto live without some employment; And it shall be theirs for both their\nlives, without paying any rent; and I will allow them 50l. per annum\nbesides, that they may keep up the stock, and be kind to any other of\ntheir relations, without being beholden to you or me for small matters;\nand for greater, where needful, you shall always have it in your power\nto accommodate them; for I shall never question your prudence. And we\nwill, so long as God spares our lives, go down, once a year, to see\nthem; and they shall come up, as often as they please, it cannot be\ntoo often, to see us: for I mean not this, my dear, to send them from\nus.--Before I proceed, does my Pamela like this?\n\nO, sir, said I, the English tongue affords not words, or, at least, I\nhave them not, to express sufficiently my gratitude! Teach me, dear sir,\ncontinued I, and pressed his dear hand to my lips, teach me some other\nlanguage, if there be any, that abounds with more grateful terms; that I\nmay not thus be choked with meanings, for which I can find no utterance.\n\nMy charmer! says he, your language is all wonderful, as your sentiments;\nand you most abound, when you seem most to want!--All that I wish, is to\nfind my proposals agreeable to you; and if my first are not, my second\nshall be, if I can but know what you wish.\n\nDid I say too much, my dearest parents, when I said, He was, if\npossible, kinder and kinder?--O the blessed man! how my heart is\noverwhelmed with his goodness!\n\nWell, said he, my dearest, let me desire you to mention this to them, to\nsee if they approve it. But, if it be your choice, and theirs, to have\nthem nearer to you, or even under the same roof with you, I will freely\nconsent to it.\n\nO no, sir, said I, (and I fear almost sinned in my grateful flight,) I\nam sure they would not choose that; they could not, perhaps, serve God\nso well if they were to live with you: For, so constantly seeing the\nhand that blesses them, they would, it may be, as must be my care to\navoid, be tempted to look no further in their gratitude, than to the\ndear dispenser of such innumerable benefits.\n\nExcellent creature! said he: My beloved wants no language, nor\nsentiments neither; and her charming thoughts, so sweetly expressed,\nwould grace any language; and this is a blessing almost peculiar to\nmy fairest.--Your so kind acceptance, my Pamela, added he, repays the\nbenefit with interest, and leaves me under obligation to your goodness.\n\nBut now, my dearest, I will tell you what we will do, with regard to\npoints of your own private charity; for far be it from me, to put under\nthat name the subject we have been mentioning; because that, and more\nthan that, is duty to persons so worthy, and so nearly related to my\nPamela, and, as such, to myself.--O how the sweet man outdoes me, in\nthoughts, words, power, and every thing!\n\nAnd this, said he, lies in very small compass; for I will allow you two\nhundred pounds a year, which Longman shall constantly pay you, at fifty\npounds a quarter, for your own use, and of which I expect no account;\nto commence from the day you enter into my other house: I mean, said he,\nthat the first fifty pounds shall then be due; because you shall have\nsomething to begin with. And, added the dear generous man, if this be\npleasing to you, let it, since you say you want words, be signified by\nsuch a sweet kiss as you gave me yesterday. I hesitated not a moment to\ncomply with these obliging terms, and threw my arms about his dear neck,\nthough in the chariot, and blessed his goodness to me. But, indeed, sir,\nsaid I, I cannot bear this generous treatment! He was pleased to say,\nDon't be uneasy, my dear, about these trifles: God has blessed me with a\nvery good estate, and all of it in a prosperous condition, and generally\nwell tenanted. I lay up money every year, and have, besides, large sums\nin government and other securities; so that you will find, what I have\nhitherto promised, is very short of that proportion of my substance,\nwhich, as my dearest wife, you have a right to.\n\nIn this sweet manner did we pass our time till evening, when the chariot\nbrought us home; and then our supper succeeded in the same agreeable\nmanner. And thus, in a rapturous circle, the time moves on; every hour\nbringing with it something more delightful than the past!--Sure nobody\nwas ever so blest as I!\n\n\nSunday, the fourth day of my happiness.\n\nNot going to chapel this morning, the reason of which I told you, I\nbestowed the time, from the hour of my beloved's rising, to breakfast,\nin prayer and thanksgiving, in my closet; and now I begin to be quite\neasy, cheerful, and free in my spirits; and the rather, as I find myself\nencouraged by the tranquillity, and pleasing vivacity, in the temper\nand behaviour of my beloved, who thereby shews he does not repent of his\ngoodness to me.\n\nI attended him to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom, and he\nseemed quite pleased with me, and said, Now does my dearest begin to\nlook upon me with an air of serenity and satisfaction: it shall be\nalways, added he, my delight to give you occasion for this sweet\nbecoming aspect of confidence and pleasure in me.--My heart, dear sir,\nsaid I, is quite easy, and has lost all its foolish tumults, which,\ncombating with my gratitude, might give an unacceptable appearance to my\nbehaviour: but now your goodness, sir, has enabled it to get the better\nof its uneasy apprehensions, and my heart is all of one piece, and\ndevoted to you, and grateful tranquillity. And could I be so happy as to\nsee you and my good Lady Davers reconciled, I have nothing in this world\nto wish for more, but the continuance of your favour. He said, I wish\nthis reconciliation, my dearest, as well as you: and I do assure you,\nmore for your sake than my own; and if she would behave tolerably, I\nwould make the terms easier to her, for that reason.\n\nHe said, I will lay down one rule for you, my Pamela, to observe in your\ndress; and I will tell you every thing I like or dislike, as it occurs\nto me: and I would have you do the same, on your part; that nothing may\nbe upon either of our minds that may occasion the least reservedness.\n\nI have often observed, in married folks, that, in a little while, the\nlady grows careless in her dress; which, to me, looks as if she would\ntake no pains to secure the affection she had gained; and shews a slight\nto her husband, that she had not to her lover. Now, you must know, this\nhas always given me great offence; and I should not forgive it, even in\nmy Pamela: though she would have this excuse for herself, that thousands\ncould not make, That she looks lovely in every thing. So, my dear,\nI shall expect of you always to be dressed by dinner-time, except\nsomething extraordinary happens; and this, whether you are to go abroad,\nor stay at home. For this, my love, will continue to you that sweet ease\nin your dress and behaviour, which you are so happy a mistress of; and\nwhomsoever I bring home with me to my table, you'll be in readiness\nto receive them; and will not want to make those foolish apologies to\nunexpected visitors, that carry with them a reflection on the conduct\nof those who make them; and, besides, will convince me, that you think\nyourself obliged to appear as graceful to your husband, as you would to\npersons less familiar to your sight.\n\nThis, dear sir, said I, is a most obliging injunction; and I most\nheartily thank you for it, and will always take care to obey it.--Why,\nmy dear, said he, you may better do this than half your sex; because\nthey too generally act in such a manner, as if they seemed to think it\nthe privilege of birth and fortune, to turn day into night, and night\ninto day, and are seldom stirring till it is time to sit down to dinner;\nand so all the good old family rules are reversed: For they breakfast,\nwhen they should dine; dine, when they should sup; and sup, when they\nshould go to bed; and, by the help of dear quadrille, sometimes go to\nbed when they should rise.--In all things but these, my dear, continued\nhe, I expect you to be a lady. And my good mother was one of this\noldfashioned cut, and, in all other respects, as worthy a lady as any in\nthe kingdom. And so you have not been used to the new way, and may the\neasier practise the other.\n\nDear sir, said I, pray give me more of your sweet injunctions. Why\nthen, continued he, I shall, in the usual course, and generally, if not\nhindered by company, like to go to bed with my dearest by eleven; and,\nif I don't, shan't hinder you. I ordinarily now rise by six in summer. I\nwill allow you to be half an hour after me, or so.\n\nThen you'll have some time you may call your own, till you give me your\ncompany to breakfast; which may be always so, as that we may have done\nat a little after nine.\n\nThen will you have several hours again at your disposal, till two\no'clock, when I shall like to sit down at table.\n\nYou will then have several useful hours more to employ yourself in, as\nyou shall best like; and I would generally go to supper by eight; and\nwhen we are resolved to stick to these oldfashioned rules, as near as\nwe can, we shall have our visitors conform to them too, and expect them\nfrom us, and suit themselves accordingly: For I have always observed,\nthat it is in every one's power to prescribe rules to himself. It is\nonly standing a few ridiculous jests at first, and that too from such,\ngenerally, as are not the most worthy to be minded; and, after a while,\nthey will say, It signifies nothing to ask him: he will have his own\nway. There is no putting him out of his bias. He is a regular piece of\nclock-work, they will joke, and all that: And why, my dear, should we\nnot be so? For man is as frail a piece of machinery as any clock-work\nwhatever; and, by irregularity, is as subject to be disordered.\n\nThen, my dear, continued the charming man, when they see they are\nreceived, at my own times, with an open countenance and cheerful heart;\nwhen they see plenty and variety at my board, and meet a kind and\nhearty welcome from us both; they will not offer to break in upon my\nconditions, nor grudge me my regular hours: And as most of these people\nhave nothing to do, except to rise in a morning, they may as well come\nto breakfast with us at half an hour after eight, in summer, as at ten\nor eleven; to dinner at two, as at four, five, or six; and to supper\nat eight, as at ten or eleven. And then our servants, too, will know,\ngenerally, the times of their business, and the hours of their leisure\nor recess; and we, as well as they, shall reap the benefits of\nthis regularity. And who knows, my dear, but we may revive the good\noldfashion in our neighbourhood, by this means?--At least it will be\ndoing our parts towards it; and answering the good lesson I learned at\nschool, Every one mend one. And the worst that will happen will be, that\nwhen some of my brother rakes, such as those who broke in upon us, so\nunwelcomely, last Thursday, are got out of the way, if that can ever be,\nand begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in their rambles,\nthey will only say, We must not go to him, for his dinner-time is over;\nand so they'll reserve me for another time, when they happen to suit it\nbetter; or, perhaps, they will take a supper and a bed with me instead\nof it.\n\nNow, my dearest, continued the kind man, you see here are more of my\ninjunctions, as you call them; and though I will not be so set, as to\nquarrel, if they are not always exactly complied with; yet, as I know\nyou won't think them unreasonable, I shall be glad they may, as often as\nthey can; and you will give your orders accordingly to your Mrs. Jervis,\nwho is a good woman, and will take pleasure in obeying you.\n\nO dearest, dear sir, said I, have you nothing more to honour me with?\nYou oblige and improve me at the same time.--What a happy lot is mine!\n\nWhy, let me see, my dearest, said he--But I think of no more at present:\nFor it would be needless to say how much I value you for your natural\nsweetness of temper, and that open cheerfulness of countenance, which\nadorns you, when nothing has given my fairest apprehensions for her\nvirtue: A sweetness, and a cheerfulness, that prepossesses in your\nfavour, at first sight, the mind of every one that beholds you.--I need\nnot, I hope, say, that I would have you diligently preserve this sweet\nappearance: Let no thwarting accident, no cross fortune, (for we must\nnot expect to be exempt from such, happy as we now are in each other!)\ndeprive this sweet face of this its principal grace: And when any thing\nunpleasing happens, in a quarter of an hour, at farthest, begin to\nmistrust yourself, and apply to your glass; and if you see a gloom\narising, or arisen, banish it instantly; smooth your dear countenance;\nresume your former composure; and then, my dearest, whose heart must\nalways be seen in her face, and cannot be a hypocrite, will find this a\nmeans to smooth her passions also: And if the occasion be too strong for\nso sudden a conquest, she will know how to do it more effectually, by\nrepairing to her closet, and begging that gracious assistance, which has\nnever yet failed her: And so shall I, my dear, who, as you once but too\njustly observed, have been too much indulged by my good mother, have\nan example from you, as well as a pleasure in you, which will never be\npalled.\n\nOne thing, continued he, I have frequently observed at the house of many\na gentleman, That when we have unexpectedly visited, or broken in upon\nthe family order laid down by the lady; and especially if any of us\nhave lain under the suspicion of having occasionally seduced our married\ncompanion into bad hours, or given indifferent examples, the poor\ngentleman has been oddly affected at our coming; though the good\nbreeding of the lady has made her just keep up appearances. He has\nlooked so conscious; has been so afraid, as it were, to disoblige; has\nmade so many excuses for some of us, before we had been accused, as have\nalways shewn me how unwelcome we have been; and how much he is obliged\nto compound with his lady for a tolerable reception of us; and, perhaps,\nshe too, in proportion to the honest man's concern to court her smiles,\nhas been more reserved, stiff, and formal; and has behaved with an\nindifference and slight that has often made me wish myself out of her\nhouse; for too plainly have I seen that it was not his.\n\nThis, my dear, you will judge, by my description, has afforded me\nsubject for animadversion upon the married life; for a man may not\n(though, in the main, he is willing to flatter himself that he is master\nof his house, and will assert his prerogative upon great occasions, when\nit is strongly invaded) be always willing to contend; and such women\nas those I have described, are always ready to take the field, and are\nworse enemies than the old Parthians, who annoy most when they seem to\nretreat; and never fail to return to the charge again, and carry on the\noffensive war, till they have tired out resistance, and made the husband\nwilling, like a vanquished enemy, to compound for small matters, in\norder to preserve something. At least the poor man does not care to let\nhis friends see his case; and so will not provoke a fire to break out,\nthat he sees (and so do his friends too) the meek lady has much ado to\nsmother; and which, very possibly, burns with a most comfortable ardour,\nafter we are gone.\n\nYou smile, my Pamela, said he, at this whimsical picture; and, I am\nsure, I never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable\noutlines; but yet I will say, that I expect from you, whoever comes to\nmy house, that you accustom yourself to one even, uniform complaisance:\nThat no frown take place on your brow: That however ill or well provided\nwe may be for their reception, you shew no flutter or discomposure: That\nwhoever you may have in your company at the time, you signify not,\nby the least reserved look, that the stranger is come upon you\nunseasonably, or at a time you wished he had not. But be facetious,\nkind, obliging to all; and, if to one more than another, to such as have\nthe least reason to expect it from you, or who are most inferior at the\ntable; for thus will you, my Pamela, cheer the doubting mind, quiet the\nuneasy heart, and diffuse ease, pleasure, and tranquillity, around my\nboard.\n\nAnd be sure, my dear, continued he, let no little accidents ruffle your\ntemper. I shall never forget once that I was at Lady Arthur's; and a\nfootman happened to stumble, and let fall a fine china dish, and broke\nit all to pieces: It was grievous to see the uneasiness it gave the poor\nlady: And she was so sincere in it, that she suffered it to spread all\nover the company; and it was a pretty large one too; and not a person\nin it but turned either her consoler, or fell into stories of the like\nmisfortunes; and so we all became, for the rest of the evening, nothing\nbut blundering footmen, and careless servants, or were turned\ninto broken jars, plates, glasses, tea-cups, and such like brittle\nsubstances. And it affected me so much, that, when I came home, I went\nto bed, and dreamt, that Robin, with the handle of his whip, broke the\nfore glass of my chariot; and I was so solicitous, methought, to keep\nthe good lady in countenance for her anger, that I broke his head in\nrevenge, and stabbed one of my coach-horses. And all the comfort I had\nwhen it was done, methought, was, that I had not exposed myself before\ncompany; and there were no sufferers, but guilty Robin, and one innocent\ncoach-horse.\n\nI was exceedingly diverted with the facetious hints, and the pleasant\nmanner in which he gave them; and I promised to improve by the excellent\nlessons contained in them.\n\nI then went up and dressed myself, as like a bride as I could, in my\nbest clothes; and, on inquiry, hearing my dearest master was gone to\nwalk in the garden, I went to find him out. He was reading in the little\nalcove; and I said, Sir, am I licensed to intrude upon you?--No, my\ndear, said he, because you cannot intrude. I am so wholly yours, that,\nwherever I am, you have not only a right to join me, but you do me a\nvery acceptable favour at the same time.\n\nI have, sir, said I, obeyed your first kind injunction, as to dressing\nmyself before dinner; but may be you are busy, sir. He put up the papers\nhe was reading, and said, I can have no business or pleasure of equal\nvalue to your company, my dear. What were you going to say?--Only, sir,\nto know if you have any more kind injunctions to give me?--I could hear\nyou talk a whole day together.--You are very obliging, Pamela, said he;\nbut you are so perfectly what I wish, that I might have spared those I\ngave you; but I was willing you should have a taste of my freedom with\nyou, to put you upon the like with me: For I am confident there can be\nno friendship lasting, without freedom, and without communicating to one\nanother even the little caprices, if my Pamela can have any such, which\nmay occasion uneasiness to either.\n\nNow, my dear, said he, be so kind as to find some fault with me, and\ntell me what you would wish me to do, to appear more agreeable to you.\nO sir, said I, and I could have kissed him, but for shame, (To be sure\nI shall grow a sad fond hussy,) I have not one single thing to wish for;\nno, not one!--He saluted me very kindly, and said, He should be sorry if\nI had, and forbore to speak it. Do you think, my dear sir, said I, that\nyour Pamela has no conscience? Do you think, that because you so\nkindly oblige her, and delight in obliging her, that she must rack\nher invention for trials of your goodness, and knows not when she's\nhappy?--O my dearest sir, added I, less than one half of the favours\nyou have so generously conferred upon me, would have exceeded my utmost\nwishes!\n\nMy dear angel, said he, and kissed me again, I shall be troublesome\nto you with my kisses, if you continue thus sweetly obliging in your\nactions and expressions. O sir, said I, I have been thinking, as I was\ndressing myself, what excellent lessons you teach me!\n\nWhen you commanded me, at your table to cheer the doubting mind and\ncomfort the uneasy heart, and to behave most kindly to those who have\nleast reason to expect it, and are most inferior; how sweetly, in every\ninstance that could possibly occur, have you done this yourself by your\npoor, unworthy Pamela, till you have diffused, in your own dear words,\nease, pleasure, and tranquillity, around my glad heart!\n\nThen again, sir, when you bid me not be disturbed by little accidents,\nor by strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly, how noble an instance\ndid you give me of this, when, on our happy wedding-day, the coming of\nSir Charles Hargrave, and the other two gentlemen, (for which you were\nquite unprovided, and which hindered our happiness of dining together on\nthat chosen day,) did not so disturb you, but that you entertained the\ngentlemen pleasantly, and parted with them civilly and kindly! What\ncharming instances are these, I have been recollecting with pleasure, of\nyour pursuing the doctrine you deliver.\n\nMy dear, said he, these observations are very kind in you, and much to\nmy advantage: But if I do not always (for I fear these were too much\naccidents) so well pursue the doctrines I lay down, my Pamela must not\nexpect that my imperfections will be a plea for her nonobservance of my\nlessons, as you call them; for, I doubt I shall never be half so perfect\nas you; and so I cannot permit you to recede in your goodness, though I\nmay find myself unable to advance as I ought in my duty.\n\nI hope, sir, said I, by God's grace, I never shall. I believe it, said\nhe; but I only mention this, knowing my own defects, lest my future\nlessons should not be so well warranted by my practice, as in the\ninstances you have kindly recollected.\n\nHe was pleased to take notice of my dress; and spanning my waist with\nhis hands, said, What a sweet shape is here! It would make one regret to\nlose it; and yet, my beloved Pamela, I shall think nothing but that loss\nwanting, to complete my happiness.--I put my bold hand before his mouth,\nand said, Hush, hush! O fie, sir!--The freest thing you have ever yet\nsaid, since I have been yours!--He kissed my hand, and said, Such an\ninnocent wish, my dearest, may be permitted me, because it is the end\nof the institution.--But say, Would such a case be unwelcome to my\nPamela?--I will say, sir, said I, and hid my blushing face on his bosom,\nthat your wishes, in every thing, shall be mine; but, pray, sir, say no\nmore. He kindly saluted me, and thanked me, and changed the subject.--I\nwas not too free, I hope.\n\nThus we talked, till we heard the coaches; and then he said, Stay here,\nin the garden, my dear, and I'll bring the company to you. And when\nhe was gone, I passed by the back-door, kneeled down against it, and\nblessed God for not permitting my then so much desired escape. I went\nto the pond, and kneeled down on the mossy bank, and again blessed God\nthere, for his mercy in my escape from myself, my then worst enemy,\nthough I thought I had none but enemies, and no friend near me. And so I\nought to do in almost every step of this garden, and every room in this\nhouse!--And I was bending my steps to the dear little chapel, to make my\nacknowledgment there; but I saw the company coming towards me.\n\nMiss Darnford said, So, Miss Andrews, how do you do now? O, you look so\neasy, so sweetly, so pleased, that I know you'll let me dance at your\nwedding, for I shall long to be there! Lady Jones was pleased to say I\nlooked like an angel: And Mrs. Peters said, I improved upon them every\ntime they saw me. Lady Darnford was also pleased to make me a fine\ncompliment, and said, I looked freer and easier every time she saw me.\nDear heart! I wish, thought I, you would spare these compliments; for I\nshall have some joke, I doubt, passed on me by-and-by, that will make me\nsuffer for all these fine things.\n\nMr. Peters said, softly, God bless you, dear daughter!--But not so much\nas my wife knows it.--Sir Simon came in last, and took me by the hand,\nand said, Mr. B----, by your leave; and kissed my hand five or six\ntimes, as if he was mad; and held it with both his, and made a very free\njest, by way of compliment, in his way. Well, I think a young rake is\nhardly tolerable; but an old rake, and an old beau, are two very sad\nthings!--And all this before daughters, women-grown!--I whispered my\ndearest, a little after, and said, I fear I shall suffer much from Sir\nSimon's rude jokes, by-and-by, when you reveal the matter.--'Tis his\nway, my dear, said he; you must now grow above these things.--Miss Nanny\nDarnford said to me, with a sort of half grave, ironical air,--Well,\nMiss Andrews, if I may judge by your easy deportment now, to what it was\nwhen I saw you last, I hope you will let my sister, if you won't me, see\nthe happy knot tied! For she is quite wild about it.--I courtesied,\nand only said, You are all very good to me, ladies.--Mr. Peters's niece\nsaid, Well, Miss Andrews, I hope, before we part, we shall be told the\nhappy day. My good master heard her, and said, You shall, you shall,\nmadam.--That's pure, said Miss Darnford.\n\nHe took me aside, and said softly, Shall I lead them to the alcove,\nand tell them there, or stay till we go in to dinner?--Neither, sir, I\nthink, said I, I fear I shan't stand it.--Nay, said he, they must know\nit; I would not have invited them else.--Why then, sir, said I, let it\nalone till they are going away.--Then, replied he, you must pull off\nyour ring. No, no, sir, said I, that I must not.--Well, said he, do you\ntell Miss Darnford of it yourself.--Indeed, sir, answered I, I cannot.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came officiously to ask my master, just then, if she should\nbring a glass of rhenish and sugar before dinner, for the gentlemen and\nladies: And he said, That's well thought of; bring it, Mrs. Jewkes.\n\nAnd she came, with Nan attending her, with two bottles and glasses, and\na salver; and must needs, making a low courtesy, offered first to me;\nsaying, Will your ladyship begin? I coloured like scarlet, and said,\nNo;--my master, to be sure!\n\nBut they all took the hint; and Miss Darnford said, I'll be hanged if\nthey have not stolen a wedding! said Mrs. Peters, It must certainly be\nso! Ah! Mr. Peters.\n\nI'll assure you, said he, I have not married them. Where were you, said\nshe, and Mr. Williams, last Thursday morning? said Sir Simon, Let me\nalone, let me alone; if any thing has been stolen, I'll find it out!\nI'm a justice of the peace, you know. And so he took me by the hand,\nand said, Come, madam, answer me, by the oath you have taken: Are you\nmarried or not?\n\nMy master smiled, to see me look so like a fool; and I said, Pray, Sir\nSimon!--Ay, ay, said he; I thought you did not look so smirking upon\nus for nothing.--Well, then, Pamela, said my master, since your blushes\ndiscover you, don't be ashamed, but confess the truth!\n\nNow, said Miss Darnford, I am quite angry; and, said Lady Darnford, I am\nquite pleased; let me give you joy, dear madam, if it be so. And so\nthey all said, and saluted me all round.--I was vexed it was before Mrs.\nJewkes; for she shook her fat sides, and seemed highly pleased to be a\nmeans of discovering it.\n\nNobody, said my master, wishes me joy. No, said Lady Jones, very\nobligingly, nobody need; for, with such a peerless spouse, you want no\ngood wishes:--And he saluted them; and when he came last to me, said,\nbefore them all, Now, my sweet bride, my Pamela, let me conclude with\nyou; for here I began to love, and here I desire to end loving, but not\ntill my life ends.\n\nThis was sweetly said, and taken great notice of; and it was doing\ncredit to his own generous choice, and vastly more than I merited.\n\nBut I was forced to stand many more jokes afterwards: For Sir Simon\nsaid, several times, Come, come, madam, now you are become one of us, I\nshall be a little less scrupulous than I have been, I'll assure you.\n\nWhen we came in to dinner, I made no difficulty of what all offered me,\nthe upper end of the table; and performed the honours of it with pretty\ntolerable presence of mind, considering. And, with much ado, my good\nbenefactor promising to be down again before winter, we got off the\nball; but appointed Tuesday evening, at Lady Darnford's, to take leave\nof all this good company, who promised to be there, my master designing\nto set out on Wednesday morning for Bedfordshire.\n\nWe had prayers in the little chapel, in the afternoon; but they all\nwished for the good clerk again, with great encomiums upon you, my dear\nfather; and the company staid supper also, and departed exceeding well\nsatisfied, and with abundance of wishes for the continuance of our\nmutual happiness; and my master desired Mr. Peters to answer for him to\nthe ringers at the town, if they should hear of it; till our return into\nthis country; and that then he would be bountiful to them, because he\nwould not publicly declare it till he had first done so in Bedfordshire.\n\n\nMonday, the fifth day.\n\nI have had very little of my dear friend's company this day; for he\nonly staid breakfast with me, and rode out to see a sick gentleman about\neighteen miles off, who begged (by a man and horse on purpose) to speak\nwith him, believing he should not recover, and upon part of whose estate\nmy master has a mortgage. He said, My dearest, I shall be very uneasy,\nif I am obliged to tarry all night from you; but, lest you should be\nalarmed, if I don't come home by ten, don't expect me: For poor Mr.\nCarlton and I have pretty large concerns together; and if he should be\nvery ill, and would be comforted by my presence, (as I know he loves me,\nand his family will be more in my power, if he dies, than I wish for,)\ncharity will not let me refuse.\n\nIt is now ten o'clock at night, and I fear he will not return. I fear,\nfor the sake of his poor sick friend, who, I doubt, is worse. Though I\nknow not the gentleman, I am sorry for his own sake, for his family's\nsake, and for my dear master's sake, who, by his kind expressions, I\nfind, loves him: And, methinks, I should be sorry any grief should touch\nhis generous heart; though yet there is no living in this world, without\ntoo many occasions for concern, even in the most prosperous state. And\nit is fit it should be so; or else, poor wretches, as we are! we should\nlook no farther, but be like sensual travellers on a journey homeward,\nwho, meeting with good entertainment at some inn on the way, put up\ntheir rest there, and never think of pursuing their journey to their\nproper home.--This, I remember, was often a reflection of my good\nlady's, to whom I owe it.\n\n\nEleven o'clock.\n\nMrs. Jewkes has been with me, and asked if I will have her for a\nbed-fellow, in want of a better? I thanked her; but I said, I would see\nhow it was to be by myself one night.\n\nI might have mentioned, that I made Mrs. Jewkes dine and sup with me;\nand she was much pleased with it, and my behaviour to her. And I could\nsee, by her manner, that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her\nformer conduct to me. But, poor wretch! it is much, I fear, because I am\nwhat I am; for she has otherwise very little remorse I doubt. Her talk\nand actions are entirely different from what they used to be, quite\ncircumspect and decent; and I should have thought her virtuous, and even\npious, had I never known her in another light.\n\nBy this we may see, my dear father and mother, of what force example is,\nand what is in the power of the heads of families to do: And this shews,\nthat evil examples, in superiors, are doubly pernicious, and doubly\nculpable, because such persons are bad themselves, and not only do no\ngood, but much harm to others; and the condemnation of such must, to be\nsure, be so much the greater!--And how much the greater still must my\ncondemnation be, who have had such a religious education under you,\nand been so well nurtured by my good lady, if I should forget, with all\nthese mercies heaped upon me, what belongs to the station I am preferred\nto!--O how I long to be doing some good! For all that is past yet, is\nmy dear, dear master's, God bless him! and return him safe to my wishes!\nfor methinks, already, 'tis a week since I saw him. If my love would not\nbe troublesome and impertinent, I should be nothing else; for I have a\ntrue grateful spirit; and I had need to have such a one, for I am poor\nin every thing but will.\n\n\nTuesday morning, eleven o'clock.\n\nMy dear, dear--master (I'm sure I should still say; but I will learn to\nrise to a softer epithet, now-and-then) is not yet come. I hope he is\nsafe and well!--So Mrs. Jewkes and I went to breakfast. But I can do\nnothing but talk and think of him, and all his kindness to me, and to\nyou, which is still me, more intimately!--I have just received a letter\nfrom him, which he wrote overnight, as I find by it, and sent early this\nmorning. This is a copy of it.\n\n\n\nTO MRS. ANDREWS\n\n\n'MY DEAREST PAMELA, Monday night.\n\n'I hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you. You may\nbelieve I can't help it. My poor friend is so very ill, that I doubt he\ncan't recover. His desires to have me stay with him are so strong, that\nI shall sit up all night with him, as it is now near one o'clock in the\nmorning; for he can't bear me out of his sight: And I have made him and\nhis distressed wife and children so easy, in the kindest assurances I\ncould give him of my consideration for him and them, that I am looked\nupon (as the poor disconsolate widow, as she, I doubt, will soon be,\ntells me,) as their good angel. I could have wished we had not engaged\nto the good neighbourhood at Sir Simon's for to-morrow night; but I am\nso desirous to set out on Wednesday for the other house, that, as well\nas in return for the civilities of so many good friends, who will be\nthere on purpose, I would not put it off. What I beg of you, therefore,\nmy dear, is, that you would go in the chariot to Sir Simon's, the sooner\nin the day the better, because you will be diverted with the company,\nwho all so much admire you; and I hope to join you there by your\ntea-time in the afternoon, which will be better than going home, and\nreturning with you, as it will be six miles difference to me; and I know\nthe good company will excuse my dress, on the occasion. I count every\nhour of this little absence for a day: for I am, with the utmost\nsincerity,\n\n                                 'My dearest love, for ever yours, etc.'\n\n'If you could go to dine with them, it will be a freedom that would be\nvery pleasing to them; and the more, as they don't expect it.'\n\n\nI begin to have a little concern, lest his fatigue should be too great,\nand for the poor sick gentleman and family; but told Mrs. Jewkes, that\nthe least intimation of his choice should be a command to me, and so\nI would go to dinner there; and ordered the chariot to be got ready to\ncarry me: when a messenger came up, just as I was dressed, to tell her\nshe must come down immediately. I see at the window, that visitors are\ncome; for there is a chariot and six horses, the company gone out of it,\nand three footmen on horseback; and I think the chariot has coronets.\nWho can it be, I wonder?--But here I will stop, for I suppose I shall\nsoon know.\n\n\nGood sirs! how unlucky this is! What shall I do!--Here is Lady Davers\ncome, her own self! and my kind protector a great, great many miles\noff!--Mrs. Jewkes, out of breath, comes and tells me this, and says,\nshe is inquiring for my master and me. She asked her, it seemed, naughty\nlady as she is, if I was whored yet! There's a word for a lady's mouth!\nMrs. Jewkes says, she knew not what to answer. And my lady said, She\nis not married, I hope? And said she, I said, No: because you have not\nowned it yet publicly. My lady said, That was well enough. Said I, I\nwill run away, Mrs. Jewkes; and let the chariot go to the bottom of\nthe elm-walk, and I will steal out of the door unperceived: But she is\ninquiring for you, madam, replied she, and I said you was within, but\ngoing out; and she said, she would see you presently, as soon as she\ncould have patience. What did she call me? said I. The creature, madam;\nI will see the creature, said she, as soon as I can have patience. Ay,\nbut, said I, the creature won't let her, if she can help it.\n\nPray, Mrs. Jewkes, favour my escape, for this once; for I am sadly\nfrighted.--Said she, I'll bid the chariot go down, as you order, and\nwait till you come; and I'll step down and shut the hall door, that you\nmay pass unobserved; for she sits cooling herself in the parlour, over\nagainst the staircase. That's a good Mrs. Jewkes! said I: But who has\nshe with her? Her woman, answered she, and her nephew; but he came\non horseback, and is going into the stables; and they have three\nfootmen.--And I wish, said I, they were all three hundred miles\noff!--What shall I do?--So I wrote thus far, and wait impatiently to\nhear the coast is clear.\n\n\nMrs. Jewkes tells me I must come down, or she will come up. What does\nshe call me now? said I. Wench, madam, Bid the wench come down to me.\nAnd her nephew and her woman are with her.\n\nSaid I, I can't go, and that's enough!--You might contrive it that I\nmight get out, if you would.--Indeed, madam, said she, I cannot; for I\nwent to shut the door, and she bid me let it stand open; and there\nshe sits over against the staircase. Then, said I, I'll get out of the\nwindow, I think!--(And fanned myself;) for I am sadly frightened. Laud,\nmadam, said she, I wonder you so much disturb yourself!--You're on the\nright side the hedge, I'm sure; and I would not be so discomposed for\nany body. Ay, said I, but who can help constitution? I dare say you\nwould no more be so discomposed, that I can help it.--Said she, Indeed,\nmadam, if it was to me, I would put on an air as mistress of the house,\nas you are, and go and salute her ladyship, and bid her welcome. Ay, ay,\nreplied I, fine talking!--But how unlucky this is, your good master is\nnot at home!\n\nWhat answer shall I give her, said she, to her desiring to see\nyou?--Tell her, said I, I am sick a-bed; I'm dying, and must not be\ndisturbed; I'm gone out--or any thing.\n\nBut her woman came up to me just as I had uttered this, and said, How\ndo you do, Mrs. Pamela? My lady desires to speak to you. So I must\ngo.--Sure she won't beat me!--Oh that my dear protector was at home!\n\n\nWell, now I will tell you all that happened in this frightful\ninterview.--And very bad it was.\n\n\nI went down, dressed as I was, and my gloves on, and my fan in my hand,\nto be just ready to step into the chariot, when I could get away; and I\nthought all my trembling fits had been over now; but I was mistaken; for\nI trembled sadly. Yet resolved to put on as good an air as I could.\n\nSo I went to the parlour, and said, making a very low courtesy, Your\nservant, my good lady! And your servant again, said she, my lady, for I\nthink you are dressed out like one.\n\nA charming girl, though! said her rakish nephew, and swore a great oath:\nDear aunt, forgive me, but I must kiss her; and was coming to me. And I\nsaid, Forbear, uncivil gentleman! I won't be used freely. Jackey, said\nmy lady, sit down, and don't touch the creature--She's proud enough\nalready. There's a great difference in her air, I'll assure you, since I\nsaw her last.\n\nWell, child, said she, sneeringly, how dost find thyself? Thou'rt\nmightily come on, of late!--I hear strange reports about thee!--Thou'rt\nalmost got into fool's paradise, I doubt!--And wilt find thyself\nterribly mistaken in a little while, if thou thinkest my brother will\ndisgrace his family, to humour thy baby-face!\n\nI see, said I, sadly vexed, (her woman and nephew smiling by,) your\nladyship has no very important commands for me; and I beg leave to\nwithdraw. Beck, said she to her woman, shut the door, my young lady and\nI must not have done so soon.\n\nWhere's your well-mannered deceiver gone, child?--says she.--Said I,\nWhen your ladyship is pleased to speak intelligibly, I shall know how to\nanswer.\n\nWell, but my dear child, said she, in drollery, don't be too pert\nneither, I beseech thee. Thou wilt not find thy master's sister half so\nready to take thy freedoms, as thy mannerly master is!--So, a little of\nthat modesty and humility that my mother's waiting-maid used to shew,\nwill become thee better than the airs thou givest thyself, since my\nmother's son has taught thee to forget thyself.\n\nI would beg, said I, one favour of your ladyship, That if you would have\nme keep my distance, you will not forget your own degree.--Why, suppose,\nMiss Pert, I should forget my degree, wouldst thou not keep thy distance\nthen?\n\nIf you, madam, said I, lessen the distance yourself, you will descend to\nmy level, and make an equality, which I don't presume to think of; for I\ncan't descend lower than I am--at least in your ladyship's esteem!\n\nDid I not tell you, Jackey, said she, that I should have a wit to talk\nto?--He, who swears like a fine gentleman at every word, rapped out an\noath, and said, drolling, I think, Mrs. Pamela, if I may be so bold as\nto say so, you should know you are speaking to Lady Davers!--Sir, said\nI, I hope there was no need of your information, and so I can't thank\nyou for it; and am sorry you seem to think it wants an oath to convince\nme of the truth of it.\n\nHe looked more foolish than I, at this, if possible, not expecting such\na reprimand.--And said, at last, Why, Mrs. Pamela, you put me half out\nof countenance with your witty reproof!--Sir, said I, you seem quite a\nfine gentleman; and it will not be easily done, I dare say.\n\nHow now, pert one, said my lady, do you know whom you talk to?--I think\nI do not, madam, replied I: and for fear I should forget myself more,\nI'll withdraw. Your ladyship's servant, said I; and was going: but she\nrose, and gave me a push, and pulled a chair, and, setting the back\nagainst the door, sat down in it.\n\nWell, said I, I can bear anything at your ladyship's hands; but I was\nready to cry though. And I went, and sat down, and fanned myself, at the\nother end of the room.\n\nHer woman, who stood all the time, said softly, Mrs. Pamela, you should\nnot sit in my lady's presence. And my lady, though she did not hear her,\nsaid, You shall sit down, child, in the room where I am, when I give you\nleave.\n\nSo I stood up, and said, When your ladyship will hardly permit me to\nstand, one might be indulged to sit down. But I ask you, said she,\nWhither your master is gone? To one Mr. Carlton, madam, about eighteen\nmiles off, who is very sick. And when does he come home?--This evening,\nmadam. And where are you going? To a gentleman's house in the town,\nmadam.--And how was you to go? In the chariot, madam.--Why, you must\nbe a lady in time, to be sure!--I believe you'd become a chariot mighty\nwell, child!--Was you ever out in it with your master?\n\nPray, your ladyship, said I, a little too pertly, perhaps, be pleased to\nask half a dozen such questions together; because one answer may do for\nall!--Why, bold-face, said she, you'll forget your distance, and bring\nme to your level before my time.\n\nI could no longer refrain tears, but said, Pray your ladyship, let me\nask what I have done, to be thus severely treated? I never did your\nladyship any harm. And if you think I am deceived, as you was pleased to\nhint, I should be more entitled to your pity, than your anger.\n\nShe rose, and took me by the hand, and led me to her chair; and then sat\ndown; and still holding my hand, said, Why Pamela, I did indeed pity\nyou while I thought you innocent; and when my brother seized you, and\nbrought you down hither, without your consent, I was concerned for you;\nand I was still more concerned for you, and loved you, when I heard of\nyour virtue and resistance, and your laudable efforts to get away from\nhim. But when, as I fear, you have suffered yourself to be prevailed\nupon, and have lost your innocence, and added another to the number\nof the fools he has ruined, (This shocked me a little,) I cannot help\nshewing my displeasure to you.\n\nMadam, replied I, I must beg no hasty judgment; I have not lost my\ninnocence.--Take care, take care, Pamela! said she: don't lose your\nveracity, as well as your honour!--Why are you here, when you are at\nfull liberty to go whither you please?--I will make one proposal to you,\nand if you are innocent, I am sure you'll accept it. Will you go and\nlive with me?--I will instantly set out with you in my chariot, and not\nstay half an hour longer in this house, if you'll go with me.--Now, if\nyou are innocent, and willing to keep so, deny me, if you can.\n\nI am innocent, madam, replied I, and willing to keep so; and yet I\ncannot consent to this. Then, said she, very mannerly, Thou liest,\nchild, that's all: and I give thee up!\n\nAnd so she arose, and walked about the room in great wrath. Her nephew\nand her woman said, Your ladyship's very good; 'tis a plain case; a very\nplain case!\n\nI would have removed the chair, to have gone out; but her nephew came\nand sat in it. This provoked me; for I thought I should be unworthy of\nthe honour I was raised to, though I was afraid to own it, if I did not\nshew some spirit; and I said, What, sir, is your pretence in this house,\nto keep me a prisoner here? Because, said he--I like it.--Do you so,\nsir? replied I: if that is the answer of a gentleman to such an one\nas I, it would not, I dare say, be the answer of a gentleman to a\ngentleman.--My lady! my lady! said he, a challenge, a challenge, by gad!\nNo, sir, said I, I am of a sex that gives no challenges; and you think\nso too, or you would not give this occasion for the word.\n\nSaid my lady, Don't be surprised, nephew; the wench could not talk thus,\nif she had not been her master's bed-fellow.--Pamela, Pamela, said she,\nand tapped me upon the shoulder two or three times, in anger, thou hast\nlost thy innocence, girl; and thou hast got some of thy bold master's\nassurance, and art fit to go any where.--Then, and please your ladyship,\nsaid I, I am unworthy of your presence, and desire I may quit it.\n\nNo, replied she, I will know first what reason you can give for not\naccepting my proposal, if you are innocent? I can give, said I, a very\ngood one: but I beg to be excused. I will hear it, said she. Why, then,\nanswered I, I should perhaps have less reason to like this gentleman,\nthan where I am.\n\nWell then, said she, I'll put you to another trial. I'll set out this\nmoment with you to your father and mother, and give you up safe to them.\nWhat do you say to that?--Ay, Mrs. Pamela, said her nephew, now what\ndoes your innocence say to that?--'Fore gad, madam, you have puzzled her\nnow.\n\nBe pleased, madam, said I, to call off this fine gentleman. Your\nkindness in these proposals makes me think you would not have me baited.\nI'll be d----d, said he, if she does not make me a bull-dog! Why she'll\ntoss us all by and by! Sir, said I, you indeed behave as if you were in\na bear-garden.\n\nJackey, be quiet, said my lady. You only give her a pretence to evade\nmy questions. Come, answer me, Pamela. I will, madam, said I, and it\nis thus: I have no occasion to be beholden to your ladyship for\nthis honour; for I am to set out to-morrow morning on the way to my\nparents.--Now again thou liest, wench!--I am not of quality, said I, to\nanswer such language.--Once again, said she, provoke me not, by these\nreflections, and this pertness; if thou dost, I shall do something by\nthee unworthy of myself. That, thought I, you have done already; but\nI ventured not to say so. But who is to carry you, said she, to your\nfather and mother? Who my master pleases, madam, said I. Ay, said she, I\ndoubt not thou wilt do every thing he pleases, if thou hast not already.\nWhy now tell me, Pamela, from thy heart, hast thou not been in bed with\nthy master? Ha, wench!--I was quite shocked at this, and said, I wonder\nhow your ladyship can use me thus!--I am sure you can expect no answer;\nand my sex, and my tender years, might exempt me from such treatment,\nfrom a person of your ladyship's birth and quality, and who, be the\ndistance ever so great, is of the same sex with me.\n\nThou art a confident wench, said she, I see!--Pray, madam, said I, let\nme beg you to permit me to go. I am waited for in the town, to dinner.\nNo, replied she, I can't spare you; and whomsoever you are to go to,\nwill excuse you, when they are told 'tis I that command you not to\ngo;--and you may excuse it too, young Lady Would-be, if you consider,\nthat it is the unexpected coming of your late lady's daughter, and your\nmaster's sister, that commands your stay.\n\nBut a pre-engagement, your ladyship will consider, is something.--Ay,\nso it is; but I know not what reason waiting-maids have to assume these\nairs of pre-engagements! Oh, Pamela, Pamela, I am sorry for thy thus\naping thy betters, and giving thyself such airs: I see thou'rt quite\nspoiled! Of a modest, innocent girl, that thou wast, and humble too,\nthou art now fit for nothing in the world, but what I fear thou art.\n\nWhy, please your ladyship, said her kinsman, what signifies all you say?\nThe matter's over with her, no doubt; and she likes it; and she is in a\nfairy-dream, and 'tis pity to awaken her before her dream's out.--Bad\nas you take me to be, madam, said I, I am not used to such language or\nreflections as this gentleman bestows upon me; and I won't bear it.\n\nWell, Jackey, said she, be silent; and, shaking her head, Poor\ngirl!--said she--what a sweet innocence is here destroyed!--A thousand\npities!--I could cry over her, if that would do her good! But she is\nquite lost, quite undone; and then has assumed a carriage upon it, that\nall those creatures are distinguished by!\n\nI cried sadly for vexation; and said, Say what you please, madam; if I\ncan help it, I will not answer another word.\n\nMrs. Jewkes came in, and asked if her ladyship was ready for dinner? She\nsaid, Yes. I would have gone out with her but my lady said, taking my\nhand, she could not spare me. And, miss, said she, you may pull off your\ngloves, and lay your fan by, for you shan't go; and, if you behave well,\nyou shall wait upon me at dinner, and then I shall have a little further\ntalk with you.\n\nMrs. Jewkes said to me, Madam, may I speak one word with you?--I can't\ntell, Mrs. Jewkes, said I; for my lady holds my hand, and you see I am a\nkind of prisoner.\n\nWhat you have to say, Mrs. Jewkes, said she, you may speak before me.\nBut she went out, and seemed vexed for me; and she says, I looked like\nthe very scarlet.\n\nThe cloth was laid in another parlour, and for three persons, and she\nled me in: Come, my little dear, said she, with a sneer, I'll hand you\nin; and I would have you think it as well as if it was my brother.\n\nWhat a sad case, thought I, should I be in, if I were as naughty as she\nthinks me! It was bad enough as it was.\n\nJackey, said my lady, come, let us go to dinner. She said to her\nwoman, Do you, Beck, help Pamela to 'tend us; we will have no\nmen-fellows.--Come, my young lady, shall I help you off with your white\ngloves? I have not, madam, said I, deserved this at your ladyship's\nhands.\n\nMrs. Jewkes, coming in with the first dish, she said, Do you expect any\nbody else, Mrs. Jewkes, that you lay the cloth for three? said she, I\nhoped your ladyship and madam would have been so well reconciled, that\nshe would have sat down too.--What means the clownish woman? said my\nlady, in great disdain: Could you think the creature should sit down\nwith me? She does, madam, and please your ladyship, with my master.--I\ndoubt it not, good woman, said she, and lies with him too, does she not?\nAnswer me, fat-face!--How these ladies are privileged.\n\nIf she does, madam, said she, there may be a reason for it, perhaps!\nand went out.--So! said she, has the wench got thee over too? Come,\nmy little dear, pull off thy gloves, I say; and off she pulled my left\nglove herself, and spied my ring. O my dear God! said she, if the wench\nhas not got a ring!--Well, this is a pretty piece of foolery, indeed!\nDost know, my friend, that thou art miserably tricked? And so, poor\ninnocent, thou hast made a fine exchange, hast thou not? Thy honesty for\nthis bauble? And, I'll warrant, my little dear has topped her part, and\nparaded it like any real wife; and so mimics still the condition!--Why,\nsaid she, and turned me round, thou art as mincing as any bride! No\nwonder thou art thus tricked out, and talkest of thy pre-engagements!\nPr'ythee, child, walk before me to that glass; survey thyself, and come\nback to me, that I may see how finely thou can'st act the theatrical\npart given thee!\n\nI was then resolved to try to be silent, although most sadly vexed.--So\nI went and sat me down in the window, and she took her place at the\nupper end of the table; and her saucy Jackey, fleering at me most\nprovokingly, sat down by her. Said he, Shall not the bride sit down by\nus, madam? Ay, well thought of! said my lady: Pray, Mrs. Bride, your\npardon for sitting down in your place!--I said nothing.\n\nSaid she, with a poor pun, Thou hast some modesty, however, child! for\nthou can'st not stand it, so must sit down, though in my presence!--I\nstill kept my seat, and said nothing.--Thought I, this is a sad thing,\nthat I am hindered too from shewing my duty where it is most due, and\nshall have anger there too, may be, if my dear master should be there\nbefore me!--So she ate some soup, as did her kinsman; and then, as she\nwas cutting up a fowl, said, If thou longest, my little dear, I will\nhelp thee to a pinion, or breast, or any thing. But may be, child, said\nhe, thou likest the rump; shall I bring it thee? And then laughed like\nan idiot, for all he is a lord's son, and may be a lord himself.--For he\nis the son of Lord ----; and his mother, who was Lord Davers's sister,\nbeing dead, he has received what education he has, from Lord Davers's\ndirection. Poor wretch! for all his greatness! he'll ne'er die for a\nplot--at least of his own hatching. If I could then have gone up, I\nwould have given you his picture. But, for one of 25 or 26 years of age,\nmuch about the age of my dear master, he is a most odd mortal.\n\nPamela, said my lady, help me to a glass of wine. No, Beck, said she,\nyou shan't; for she was offering to do it. I will have my lady bride\nconfer that honour upon me; and then I shall see if she can stand up. I\nwas silent, and never stirred.\n\nDost hear, chastity? said she, help me to a glass of wine, when I bid\nthee.--What! not stir? Then I'll come and help thee to one. Still I\nstirred not, and, fanning myself, continued silent. Said she, When I\nhave asked thee, meek-one, half a dozen questions together, I suppose\nthou wilt answer them all at once! Pretty creature, is not that it?\n\nI was so vexed, I bit a piece of my fan out, not knowing what I did; but\nstill I said nothing, and did nothing but flutter it, and fan myself.\n\nI believe, said she, my next question will make up half a dozen; and\nthen, modest one, I shall be entitled to an answer.\n\nHe rose and brought the bottle and glass; Come, said he, Mrs. Bride, be\npleased to help my lady, and I will be your deputy. Sir, replied I, it\nis in a good hand; help my lady yourself.--Why, creature, said she, dost\nthou think thyself above it?--And then flew into a passion:--Insolence!\ncontinued she, this moment, when I bid you, know your duty, and give me\na glass of wine; or--\n\nSo I took a little spirit then--Thought I, I can but be beat.--If, said\nI, to attend your ladyship at table, or even kneel at your feet, was\nrequired of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the person you\nthink me; but, if it be to triumph over one who has received honours,\nthat she thinks require her to act another part, not to be utterly\nunworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it.\n\nShe seemed quite surprised, and looked now upon her kinsman, and then\nupon her woman--I'm astonished--quite astonished!--Well, then, I suppose\nyou would have me conclude you my brother's wife; could you not?\n\nYour ladyship, said I, compels me to say this!--Well, returned she, but\ndost thou thyself think thou art so?--Silence, said her kinsman, gives\nconsent. 'Tis plain enough she does. Shall I rise, madam, and pay my\nduty to my new aunt?\n\nTell me, said my lady, what, in the name of impudence, possesses thee\nto dare to look upon thyself as my sister?--Madam, replied I, that is a\nquestion will better become your most worthy brother to answer, than me.\n\nShe was rising in great wrath: but her woman said, Good your ladyship,\nyou'll do yourself more harm than her; and if the poor girl has been\ndeluded so, as you have heard, with the sham marriage, she'll be more\ndeserving of your ladyship's pity than anger. True, Beck, very true,\nsaid my lady; but there's no bearing the impudence of the creature in\nthe mean time.\n\nI would have gone out at the door, but her kinsman ran and set his back\nagainst it. I expected bad treatment from her pride, and violent temper;\nbut this was worse than I could have thought of. And I said to him, Sir,\nwhen my master comes to know your rude behaviour, you will, may be, have\ncause to repent it: and went and sat down in the window again.\n\nAnother challenge, by gad! said he; but I am glad she says her\nmaster!--You see, madam, she herself does not believe she is married,\nand so has not been so much deluded as you think for: And, coming to\nme with a most barbarous air of insult, he said, kneeling on one knee\nbefore me, My new aunt, your blessing or your curse, I care not which;\nbut quickly give me one or other, that I may not lose my dinner!\n\nI gave him a most contemptuous look: Tinselled toy, said I, (for he was\nlaced all over), twenty or thirty years hence, when you are at age, I\nshall know how to answer you better; mean time, sport with your footman,\nand not with me! and so I removed to another window nearer the door, and\nhe looked like a sad fool, as he is.\n\nBeck, Beck, said my lady, this is not to be borne! Was ever the like\nheard! Is my kinsman and Lord Davers's to be thus used by such a slut?\nAnd was coming to me: And indeed I began to be afraid; for I have but\na poor heart, after all. But Mrs. Jewkes hearing high words, came in\nagain, with the second course, and said, Pray your ladyship, don't so\ndiscompose yourself. I am afraid this day's business will make matters\nwider than ever between your good ladyship and your brother: For my\nmaster doats upon madam.\n\nWoman, said she, do thou be silent! Sure, I that was born in this house,\nmay have some privilege in it, without being talked to by the saucy\nservants in it!\n\nI beg pardon, madam, replied Mrs. Jewkes; and, turning to me, said,\nMadam, my master will take it very ill if you make him wait for you\nthus. So I rose to go out; but my lady said, If it was only for that\nreason she shan't go.--And went to the door and shut it, and said to\nMrs. Jewkes, Woman, don't come again till I call you; and coming to me,\ntook my hand, and said, Find your legs, miss, if you please.\n\nI stood up, and she tapped my cheek! Oh, says she, that scarlet glow\nshews what a rancorous little heart thou hast, if thou durst shew it!\nbut come this way; and so led me to her chair: Stand there, said she,\nand answer me a few questions while I dine, and I'll dismiss thee, till\nI call thy impudent master to account; and then I'll have you face to\nface, and all this mystery of iniquity shall be unravelled; for, between\nyou, I will come to the bottom of it.\n\nWhen she had sat down, I moved to the window on the other side of the\nparlour, looking into the private garden; and her woman said, Mrs.\nPamela, don't make my lady angry. Stand by her ladyship, as she bids\nyou. Said I, Pray, good now, let it suffice you to attend your lady's\ncommands, and don't lay yours upon me.--Your pardon, sweet Mrs. Pamela,\nsaid she. Times are much altered with you, I'll assure you! said I, Her\nladyship has a very good plea to be free in the house that she was born\nin; but you may as well confine your freedoms to the house in which\nyou had your breedings. Why, how now, Mrs. Pamela, said she; since you\nprovoke me to it, I'll tell you a piece of my mind. Hush, hush, good\nwoman, said I, alluding to my lady's language to Mrs. Jewkes, my lady\nwants not your assistance:--Besides, I can't scold!\n\nThe woman was ready to flutter with vexation; and Lord Jackey laughed as\nif he would burst his sides: G--d d--n me, Beck, said he, you'd better\nlet her alone to my lady here for she'll be too many for twenty such\nas you and I!--And then he laughed again, and repeated--I can't scold,\nquoth-a! but, by gad, miss, you can speak d----d spiteful words, I\ncan tell you that!--Poor Beck, poor Beck!--'Fore gad, she's quite\ndumbfoundered!\n\nWell, but Pamela, said my lady, come hither, and tell me truly, Dost\nthou think thyself really married?--Said I, and approached her chair, My\ngood lady, I'll answer all your commands, if you'll have patience with\nme, and not be so angry as you are: But I can't bear to be used thus\nby this gentleman, and your ladyship's woman. Child, said she, thou art\nvery impertinent to my kinsman; thou can'st not be civil to me; and my\nladyship's woman is much thy betters. But that's not the thing!--Dost\nthou think thou art really married?\n\nI see, madam, said I, you are resolved not to be pleased with any answer\nI shall return: If I should say, I am not, then your ladyship will call\nme hard names, and, perhaps, I should tell a fib. If I should say, I\nam, your ladyship will ask, how I have the impudence to be so?--and will\ncall it a sham-marriage. I will, said she, be answered more directly.\nWhy, what, madam, does it signify what I think? Your ladyship will\nbelieve as you please.\n\nBut can'st thou have the vanity, the pride, the folly, said she, to\nthink thyself actually married to my brother? He is no fool, child; and\nlibertine enough of conscience; and thou art not the first in the\nlist of his credulous harlots.--Well, well, said I, (and was in a sad\nflutter,) as I am easy, and pleased with my lot, pray, madam, let me\ncontinue so, as long as I can. It will be time enough for me to know the\nworst, when the worst comes. And if it should be so bad, your ladyship\nshould pity me, rather than thus torment me before my time.\n\nWell, said she, but dost not think I am concerned, that a young wench,\nwhom my poor dear mother loved so well, should thus cast herself away,\nand suffer herself to be deluded and undone, after such a noble stand as\nthou madst for so long a time?\n\nI think myself far from being deluded and undone, and am as innocent and\nvirtuous as ever I was in my life. Thou liest, child, said she.\n\nSo your ladyship told me twice before.\n\nShe gave me a slap on the hand for this; and I made a low courtesy, and\nsaid, I humbly thank your ladyship! but I could not refrain tears: And\nadded, Your dear brother, madam, however, won't thank your ladyship for\nthis usage of me, though I do. Come a little nearer me, my dear, said\nshe, and thou shalt have a little more than that to tell him of, if thou\nthink'st thou hast not made mischief enough already between a sister and\nbrother. But, child, if he was here, I would serve thee worse, and him\ntoo. I wish he was, said I.--Dost thou threaten me, mischief-maker, and\ninsolent as thou art?\n\nNow, pray, madam, said I, (but got to a little distance,) be pleased to\nreflect upon all that you have said to me, since I have had the honour,\nor rather misfortune, to come into your presence; whether you have said\none thing befitting your ladyship's degree to me, even supposing I was\nthe wench and the creature you imagine me to be?--Come hither, my pert\ndear, replied she, come but within my reach for one moment, and I'll\nanswer thee as thou deservest.\n\nTo be sure she meant to box my ears. But I should not be worthy my happy\nlot if I could not shew some spirit.\n\nWhen the cloth was taken away, I said, I suppose I may now depart your\npresence, madam? I suppose not, said she. Why, I'll lay thee a wager,\nchild, thy stomach's too full to eat, and so thou may'st fast till thy\nmannerly master comes home.\n\nPray your ladyship, said her woman, let the poor girl sit down at table\nwith Mrs. Jewkes and me.--Said I, You are very kind, Mrs. Worden; but\ntimes, as you said, are much altered with me; and I have been of late so\nmuch honoured with better company, that I can't stoop to yours.\n\nWas ever such confidence! said my lady.--Poor Beck! poor Beck! said her\nkinsman; why she beats you quite out of the pit!--Will your ladyship,\nsaid I, be so good as to tell me how long I am to tarry? For you'll\nplease to see by that letter, that I am obliged to attend my master's\ncommands. And so I gave her the dear gentleman's letter from Mr.\nCarlton's, which I thought would make her use me better, as she might\njudge by it of the honour done me by him. Ay, said she, this is my\nworthy brother's hand. It is directed to Mrs. Andrews. That's to you, I\nsuppose, child? And so she ran on, making remarks as she went along, in\nthis manner:\n\n\nMy dearest PAMELA,--'Mighty well!'--I hope my not coming home this\nnight, will not frighten you!--'Vastly tender, indeed!--And did it\nfrighten you, child?'--You may believe I can't help it. 'No, to be\nsure!--A person in thy way of life, is more tenderly used than an honest\nwife. But mark the end of it!'--I could have wished--'Pr'ythee, Jackey,\nmind this,'--we--'mind the significant we,'--had not engaged to the good\nneighbourhood, at Sir Simon's, for to-morrow night.--'Why, does the good\nneighbourhood, and does Sir Simon, permit thy visits, child? They shall\nhave none of mine, then, I'll assure them!'--But I am so desirous to set\nout on Wednesday for the other house--'So, Jackey, but we just nicked\nit, I find:'--that, as well as in return for the civilities of so\nmany good friends, who will be there on purpose, I would not put it\noff.--'Now mind, Jackey.'--What I beg of you--'Mind the wretch, that\ncould use me and your uncle as he has done; he is turned beggar to this\ncreature!'--I beg of you, therefore, my dear--'My dear! there's for\nyou!--I wish I may not be quite sick before I get through.'--What I beg\nof you, therefore, my dear, [and then she looked me full in the face,]\nis, that you will go in the chariot to Sir Simon's, the sooner in the\nday the better;--'Dear heart! and why so, when WE were not expected till\nnight? Why, pray observe the reason--Hem!' [said she]--Because you will\nbe diverted with the company;--'Mighty kind, indeed!'--who all--'Jackey,\nJackey, mind this,'--who all so much admire you. 'Now he'd ha' been\nhanged before he would have said so complaisant a thing, had he\nbeen married, I'm sure!'--Very true, aunt, said he: A plain case\nthat!--[Thought I, that's hard upon poor matrimony, though I hope my\nlady don't find it so. But I durst not speak out.]--Who all so much\nadmire you, [said she,] 'I must repeat that--Pretty miss!--I wish thou\nwast as admirable for thy virtue, as for that baby-face of thine!'--And\nI hope to join you there by your tea-time in the afternoon!--'So, you're\nin very good time, child, an hour or two hence, to answer all your\nimportant pre-engagements!'--which will be better than going home, and\nreturning with you; as it will be six miles difference to me; and I know\nthe good company will excuse my dress on this occasion.--'Very true; any\ndress is good enough, I'm sure, for such company as admire thee, child,\nfor a companion, in thy ruined state!--Jackey, Jackey, mind, mind,\nagain! more fine things still!'--I count every hour of this little\nabsence for a day!--'There's for you! Let me repeat it'--I count every\nhour of this little absence for a day!--'Mind, too, the wit of the good\nman! One may see love is a new thing to him. Here is a very tedious\ntime gone since he saw his deary; no less than, according to his amorous\ncalculation, a dozen days and nights, at least! and yet, TEDIOUS as\nit is, it is but a LITTLE ABSENCE. Well said, my good, accurate, and\nconsistent brother!--But wise men in love are always the greatest\nsimpletons!--But now cones the reason why this LITTLE ABSENCE, which, at\nthe same time, is SO GREAT an ABSENCE, is so tedious:'--FOR I am--'Ay,\nnow for it!'--with the UTMOST sincerity, my dearest love--'Out upon\nDEAREST love! I shall never love the word again! Pray bid your uncle\nnever call me dearest love, Jackey!'--For ever yours!--'But, brother,\nthou liest!--Thou knowest thou dost.--And so, my good Lady Andrews, or\nwhat shall I call you? Your dearest love will be for ever yours! And\nhast thou the vanity to believe this?--But stay, here is a postscript.\nThe poor man knew not when to have done to his dearest love.--He's sadly\nin for't, truly! Why, his dearest love, you are mighty happy in such a\nlover!'--If you could go to dine with them--'Cry you mercy, my dearest\nlove, now comes the pre-engagement!'--it will be a freedom that will be\nvery pleasing to them, and the more, as they don't expect it.\n\nWell, so much for this kind letter! But you see you cannot honour this\nadmiring company with this little expected, and, but in complaisance\nto his folly, I dare say, little desired freedom. And I cannot forbear\nadmiring you so much myself, my dearest love, that I will not spare\nyou at all, this whole evening: For 'tis a little hard, if thy master's\nsister may not be blest a little bit with thy charming company.\n\nSo I found I had shewn her my letter to very little purpose, and\nrepented it several times, as she read on.--Well, then, said I, I\nhope your ladyship will give me leave to send my excuses to your good\nbrother, and say, that your ladyship is come, and is so fond of me, that\nyou will not let me leave you.--Pretty creature, said she; and wantest\nthou thy good master to come, and quarrel with his sister on thy\naccount?--But thou shalt not stir from my presence; and I would now ask\nthee, What it is thou meanest by shewing me this letter?--Why, madam,\nsaid I, to shew your ladyship how I was engaged for this day and\nevening.--And for nothing else? said she. Why, I can't tell, madam, said\nI: But if you can collect from it any other circumstances, I might hope\nI should not be the worse treated.\n\nI saw her eyes began to sparkle with passion: and she took my hand,\nand said, grasping it very hard, I know, confident creature, that thou\nshewedst it me to insult me!--You shewed it me, to let me see, that\nhe could be civiller to a beggar born, than to me, or to my good Lord\nDavers!--You shewed it me, as if you'd have me to be as credulous a fool\nas yourself, to believe your marriage true, when I know the whole trick\nof it, and have reason to believe you do too; and you shewed it me, to\nupbraid me with his stooping to such painted dirt, to the disgrace of a\nfamily, ancient and untainted beyond most in the kingdom. And now will I\ngive thee one hundred guineas for one bold word, that I may fell thee at\nmy foot!\n\nWas not this very dreadful! To be sure, I had better have kept the\nletter from her. I was quite frightened!--And this fearful menace,\nand her fiery eyes, and rageful countenance, made me lose all my\ncourage.--So I said, weeping, Good your ladyship, pity me!--Indeed I am\nhonest; indeed I am virtuous; indeed I would not do a bad thing for the\nworld!\n\nThough I know, said she, the whole trick of thy pretended marriage, and\nthy foolish ring here, and all the rest of the wicked nonsense, yet I\nshould not have patience with thee, if thou shouldst but offer to let\nme know thy vanity prompts thee to believe thou art married to my\nbrother!--I could not bear the thought!--So take care, Pamela; take\ncare, beggarly brat; take care.\n\nGood madam, said I, spare my dear parents. They are honest and\nindustrious: they were once in a very creditable way, and never were\nbeggars. Misfortunes may attend any body: And I can bear the cruellest\nimputations on myself, because I know my innocence; but upon such\nhonest, industrious parents, who went through the greatest trials,\nwithout being beholden to any thing but God's blessing, and their own\nhard labour; I cannot bear reflection.\n\nWhat! art thou setting up for a family, creature as thou art! God give\nme patience with thee! I suppose my brother's folly, and his wickedness,\ntogether, will, in a little while, occasion a search at the heralds'\noffice, to set out thy wretched obscurity! Provoke me, I desire thou\nwilt! One hundred guineas will I give thee, to say but thou thinkest\nthou art married to my brother.\n\nYour ladyship, I hope, won't kill me: And since nothing I can say will\nplease you, but your ladyship is resolved to quarrel with me; since\nI must not say what I think, on one hand nor another; whatever your\nladyship designs by me, be pleased to do, and let me depart your\npresence!\n\nShe gave me a slap on the hand, and reached to box my ear; but Mrs.\nJewkes hearkening without, and her woman too, they both came in at\nthat instant; and Mrs. Jewkes said, pushing herself in between us; Your\nladyship knows not what you do! Indeed you don't! My master would never\nforgive me, if I suffered, in his house, one he so dearly loves, to be\nso used; and it must not be, though you are Lady Davers. Her woman too\ninterposed, and told her, I was not worth her ladyship's anger. But she\nwas like a person beside herself.\n\nI offered to go out, and Mrs. Jewkes took my hand to lead me out: But\nher kinsman set his back against the door, and put his hand to his\nsword, and said, I should not go, till his aunt permitted it. He drew it\nhalf-way, and I was so terrified, that I cried out, Oh, the sword!\nthe sword! and, not knowing what I did, I ran to my lady herself, and\nclasped my arms about her, forgetting, just then, how much she was my\nenemy, and said, sinking on my knees, Defend me, good your ladyship! the\nsword! the sword!--Mrs. Jewkes said, Oh! my lady will fall into fits!\nBut Lady Davers was herself so startled at the matter being carried so\nfar, that she did not mind her words, and said, Jackey, don't draw your\nsword!--You see, as great as her spirit is, she can't bear that.\n\nCome, said she, be comforted; he shan't frighten you!--I'll try to\novercome my anger, and will pity you. So, wench, rise up, and don't be\nfoolish. Mrs. Jewkes held her salts to my nose, and I did not faint. And\nmy lady said, Mrs. Jewkes, if you would be forgiven, leave Pamela and me\nby ourselves; and, Jackey, do you withdraw; only you, Beck, stay.\n\nSo I sat down in the window, all in a sad fluster; for, to be sure, I\nwas sadly frightened.--Said her woman, You should not sit in my lady's\npresence, Mrs. Pamela. Yes, let her sit till she is a little recovered\nof her fright, said my lady, and do you set my chair by her. And so she\nsat over-against me, and said, To be sure, Pamela, you have been very\nprovoking with your tongue, to be sure you have, as well upon my nephew,\n(who is a man of quality too,) as me. And palliating her cruel usage,\nand beginning, I suppose, to think herself she had carried it further\nthan she could answer it to her brother, she wanted to lay the fault\nupon me. Own, said she, you have been very saucy; and beg my pardon,\nand beg Jackey's pardon, and I will try to pity you. For you are a sweet\ngirl, after all; if you had but held out, and been honest.\n\n'Tis injurious to me, madam, said I, to imagine I am not honest!--Said\nshe, Have you not been a-bed with my brother? tell me that. Your\nladyship, replied I, asks your questions in a strange way, and in\nstrange words.\n\nO! your delicacy is wounded, I suppose, by my plain questions!--This\nniceness will soon leave you, wench: It will, indeed. But answer me\ndirectly. Then your ladyship's next question, said I, will be, Am I\nmarried? And you won't bear my answer to that--and will beat me again.\n\nI han't beat you yet; have I, Beck? said she. So you want to make out a\nstory, do you?--But, indeed, I can't bear thou shouldst so much as\nthink thou art my sister. I know the whole trick of it; and so, 'tis my\nopinion, dost thou. It is only thy little cunning, that it might look\nlike a cloak to thy yielding, and get better terms from him. Pr'ythee,\npr'ythee, wench, thou seest I know the world a little;--almost as much\nat thirty-two, as thou dost at sixteen.--Remember that!\n\nI rose from the window, and walking to the other end of the room, Beat\nme again, if you please, said I, but I must tell your ladyship, I scorn\nyour words, and am as much married as your ladyship!\n\nAt that she ran to me; but her woman interposed again: Let the vain\nwicked creature go from your presence, madam, said she. She is not\nworthy to be in it. She will but vex your ladyship. Stand away, Beck,\nsaid she. That's an assertion that I would not take from my brother, I\ncan't bear it. As much married as I!--Is that to be borne? But if the\ncreature believes she is, madam, said her woman, she is to be as much\npitied for her credulity, as despised for her vanity.\n\nI was in hopes to have slipt out at the door; but she caught hold of my\ngown, and pulled me back. Pray your ladyship, said I, don't kill me!--I\nhave done no harm.--But she locked the door, and put the key in her\npocket. So, seeing Mrs. Jewkes before the window, I lifted up the sash,\nand said, Mrs. Jewkes, I believe it would be best for the chariot to go\nto your master, and let him know, that Lady Davers is here; and I cannot\nleave her ladyship.\n\nShe was resolved to be displeased, let me say what I would.\n\nSaid she, No, no; he'll then think, that I make the creature my\ncompanion, and know not how to part with her. I thought your ladyship,\nreplied I, could not have taken exceptions at this message. Thou knowest\nnothing, wench, said she, of what belongs to people of condition: How\nshouldst thou? Nor, thought I, do I desire it, at this rate.\n\nWhat shall I say, madam? said I. Nothing at all, replied she; let him\nexpect his dearest love, and be disappointed; it is but adding a\nfew more hours, and he will make every one a day, in his amorous\naccount.--Mrs. Jewkes coming nearer me, and my lady walking about the\nroom, being then at the end, I whispered, Let Robert stay at the elms;\nI'll have a struggle for't by and by.\n\nAs much married as I! repeated she.--The insolence of the creature!--And\nso she walked about the room, talking to herself, to her woman, and\nnow and then to me; but seeing I could not please her, I thought I\nhad better be silent. And then it was, Am I not worthy an answer? If\nI speak, said I, your ladyship is angry at me, though ever so\nrespectfully; if I do not, I cannot please: Would your ladyship tell me\nbut how I shall oblige you, and I would do it with all my heart.\n\nConfess the truth, said she, that thou art an undone creature; hast been\nin bed with thy master; and art sorry for it, and for the mischief\nthou hast occasioned between him and me; and then I'll pity thee, and\npersuade him to pack thee off, with a hundred or two of guineas; and\nsome honest farmer may take pity of thee, and patch up thy shame, for\nthe sake of the money; and if nobody will have thee, thou must vow\npenitence, and be as humble as I once thought thee.\n\nI was quite sick at heart, at all this passionate extravagance, and to\nbe hindered from being where was the desire of my soul, and afraid too\nof incurring my dear master's displeasure; and, as I sat, I saw it was\nno hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard, the parlour\nbeing even with the yard, and so have a fair run for it; and after I had\nseen my lady at the other end of the room again, in her walks, having\nnot pulled down the sash, when I spoke to Mrs. Jewkes, I got upon the\nseat, and whipped out in a minute, and ran away as hard as I could\ndrive, my lady calling after me to return, and her woman at the other\nwindow: But two of her servants appearing at her crying out, and she\nbidding them to stop me, I said, Touch me at your peril, fellows!\nBut their lady's commands would have prevailed on them, had not Mr.\nColbrand, who, it seems, had been kindly ordered, by Mrs. Jewkes, to be\nwithin call, when she saw how I was treated, come up, and put on one of\nhis deadly fierce looks, the only time, I thought, it ever became him,\nand said, He would chine the man, that was his word, who offered to\ntouch his lady; and so he ran alongside of me; and I heard my lady say,\nThe creature flies like a bird! And, indeed, Mr. Colbrand, with his huge\nstrides, could hardly keep pace with me; and I never stopped, till I\ngot to the chariot; and Robert had got down, seeing me running at a\ndistance, and held the door in his hand, with the step ready down; and\nin I jumped, without touching the step, saying, Drive me, drive me, as\nfast as you can, out of my lady's reach! And he mounted; and Colbrand\nsaid, Don't be frightened, madam; nobody shall hurt you.--And shut the\ndoor, and away Robert drove; but I was quite out of breath, and did not\nrecover it, and my fright, all the way.\n\nMr. Colbrand was so kind, but I did not know it till the chariot stopped\nat Sir Simon's, to step up behind the carriage, lest, as he said, my\nlady should send after me; and he told Mrs. Jewkes, when he got home,\nthat he never saw such a runner as me in his life.\n\nWhen the chariot stopped, which was not till six o'clock, so long did\nthis cruel lady keep me, Miss Darnford ran out to me: O madam, said she,\nten times welcome! but you'll be beat, I can tell you! for here has been\nMr. B---- come these two hours, and is very angry with you.\n\nThat's hard indeed, said I;--Indeed I can't afford it;--for I hardly\nknew what I said, having not recovered my fright. Let me sit down, miss,\nany where, said I; for I have been sadly off. So I sat down, and was\nquite sick with the hurry of my spirits, and leaned upon her arm.\n\nSaid she, Your lord and master came in very moody; and when he had staid\nan hour, and you not come, he began to fret, and said, He did not expect\nso little complaisance from you. And he is now sat down, with great\npersuasion, to a game at loo.--Come, you must make your appearance, lady\nfair; for he is too sullen to attend you, I doubt.\n\nYou have no strangers, have you miss? said I.--Only two women relations\nfrom Stamford, replied she, and an humble servant of one of them.--Only\nall the world, miss! said I.--What shall I do, if he be angry? I can't\nbear that.\n\nJust as I had said so, came in Lady Darnford and Lady Jones to chide me,\nas they said, for not coming sooner. And before I could speak, came in\nmy dear master. I ran to him. How dy'e Pamela? said he; and saluting me,\nwith a little more formality than I could well bear.--I expected half\na word from me, when I was so complaisant to your choice, would have\ndetermined you, and that you'd have been here to dinner;--and the\nrather, as I made my request a reasonable one, and what I thought would\nbe agreeable to you. O dear sir, said I, pray, pray, hear me, and you'll\npity me, and not be displeased! Mrs. Jewkes will tell you, that as\nsoon as I had your kind commands, I said, I would obey you, and come to\ndinner with these good ladies; and so prepared myself instantly, with\nall the pleasure in the world. Lady Darnford and miss said I was their\ndear!--Look you, said miss, did I not tell you, stately one, that\nsomething must have happened? But, O these tyrants! these men!\n\nWhy, what hindered it, my dear? said he: give yourself time; you seem\nout of breath!--O sir, said I, out of breath! well I may!--For, just as\nI was ready to come away, who should drive into the court-yard, but Lady\nDavers!--Lady Davers! Nay, then, my sweet dear, said he, and saluted me\nmore tenderly, hast thou had a worse trial than I wish thee, from one\nof the haughtiest women in England, though my sister!--For, she too, my\nPamela, was spoiled by my good mother!--But have you seen her?\n\nYes, sir, said I, and more than seen her!--Why sure, said he, she has\nnot had the insolence to strike my girl!--Sir, said I, but tell me you\nforgive me; for indeed I could not come sooner; and these good ladies\nbut excuse me; and I'll tell you all another time; for to take up the\ngood company's attention now, will spoil their pleasantry, and be to\nthem, though more important to me, like the broken china you cautioned\nme about.\n\nThat's a dear girl! said he; I see my hints are not thrown away upon\nyou; and I beg pardon for being angry with you; and, for the future,\nwill stay till I hear your defence, before I judge you. Said Miss\nDarnford, This is a little better! To own a fault is some reparation;\nand what every lordly husband will not do. He said, But tell me, my\ndear, did Lady Davers offer you any incivility? O sir, replied I, she\nis your sister, and I must not tell you all; but she has used me very\nseverely! Did you tell her, said he, you were married? Yes, sir, I did\nat last; but she will have it 'tis a sham-marriage, and that I am a vile\ncreature: and she was ready to beat me, when I said so: for she could\nnot have patience, that I should be deemed her sister, as she said.\n\nHow unlucky it was, replied he, I was not at home?--Why did you not send\nto me here? Send, sir! I was kept prisoner by force. They would not let\nme stir, or do you think I would have been hindered from obeying you?\nNay, I told them, that I had a pre-engagement; but she ridiculed me, and\nsaid, Waiting-maids talk of pre-engagements! And then I shewed her your\nkind letter; and she made a thousand remarks upon it, and made me wish\nI had not. In short, whatever I could do or say, there was no pleasing\nher; and I was a creature and wench, and all that was naught. But you\nmust not be angry with her on my account.\n\nWell, but, said he, I suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her; for\nshe came before dinner, I presume, if it was soon after you had received\nmy letter! No, sir, dine with my lady! no, indeed! Why, she would make\nme wait at table upon her, with her woman, because she would not expose\nherself and me before the men-servants; which you know, sir, was very\ngood of her ladyship.\n\nWell, said he, but did you wait upon her? Would you have had me,\nsir? said I.--Only, Pamela, replied he, if you did, and knew not what\nbelonged to your character, as my wife, I shall be very angry with you.\nSir, said I, I did not, but refused it, out of consideration to the\ndignity you have raised me to; else, sir, I could have waited on my\nknees upon your sister.\n\nNow, said he, you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment. She\nis an insolent woman, and shall dearly repent it. But, sir, she is to be\nexcused, because she won't believe I am indeed married; so don't be too\nangry at her ladyship.\n\nHe said, Ladies, pray don't let us keep you from the company; I'll only\nask a question or two more, and attend you. Said Lady Jones, I so much\nlong to hear this story of poor madam's persecution, that, if it was\nnot improper, I should be glad to stay. Miss Darnford would stay for the\nsame reason; my master saying, He had no secrets to ask; and that it was\nkind of them to interest themselves in my grievances.\n\nBut Lady Darnford went into the company, and told them the cause of my\ndetention; for, it seems, my dear master loved me too well, to keep to\nhimself the disappointment my not being here to receive him, was to\nhim; and they had all given the two Misses Boroughs and Mr. Perry,\nthe Stamford guests, such a character of me, that they said they were\nimpatient to see me.\n\nSaid my master, But, Pamela, you said they and them: Who had my sister\nwith her besides her woman? Her nephew, sir, and three footmen on\nhorseback; and she and her woman were in her chariot and six.\n\nThat's a sad coxcomb, said he: How did he behave to you?--Not\nextraordinarily, sir; but I should not complain; for I was even with\nhim; because I thought I ought not to bear with him as with my lady.\n\nBy Heaven! said he, if I knew he behaved unhandsomely to my jewel, I'd\nsend him home to his uncle without his ears. Indeed, sir, returned I,\nI was as hard upon him as he was upon me. Said he, 'Tis kind to say so;\nbut I believe I shall make them dearly repent their visit, if I find\ntheir behaviour to call for my resentment.\n\nBut, sure, my dear, you might have got away when you went to your own\ndinner? Indeed, sir, said I, her ladyship locked me in, and would not\nlet me stir.--So you ha'nt ate any dinner? No, indeed, sir, nor had a\nstomach for any. My poor dear, said he. But then, how got you away at\nlast? O sir, replied I, I jumped out of the parlour window, and ran away\nto the chariot, which had waited for me several hours, by the elm-walk,\nfrom the time of my lady's coming (for I was just going, as I said); and\nMr. Colbrand conducted me through her servants, whom she called to, to\nstop me; and was so kind to step behind the chariot, unknown to me, and\nsaw me safe here.\n\nI'm sure, said he, these insolent creatures must have treated you\nvilely. But tell me, what part did Mrs. Jewkes act in this affair? A\nvery kind part, sir, said I, in my behalf; and I shall thank her for it.\nSweet creature! said he, thou lovest to speak well of every body; but\nI hope she deserves it; for she knew you were married.--But come, we'll\nnow join the company, and try to forget all you have suffered, for two\nor three hours, that we may not tire the company with our concerns\nand resume the subject as we go home: and you shall find I will do you\njustice, as I ought. But you forgive me, sir, said I, and are not angry?\nForgive you, my dear! returned he--I hope you forgive me! I shall never\nmake you satisfaction for what you have suffered from me, and for me!\nAnd with those words he led me into the company.\n\nHe very kindly presented me to the two stranger ladies, and the\ngentleman, and them to me: and Sir Simon, who was at cards, rose from\ntable, and saluted me: Adad! madam, said he, I'm glad to see you here.\nWhat, it seems you have been a prisoner! 'Twas well you was, or your\nspouse and I should have sat in judgment upon you, and condemned you to\na fearful punishment for your first crime of laesae majestatis: (I had\nthis explained to me afterwards, as a sort of treason against my liege\nlord and husband:) for we husbands hereabouts, said he, are resolved to\nturn over a new leaf with our wives, and your lord and master shall\nshew us the way, I can tell you that. But I see by your eyes, my sweet\nculprit, added he, and your complexion, you have had sour sauce to your\nsweet meat.\n\nMiss Darnford said, I think we are obliged to our sweet guest, at last;\nfor she was forced to jump out at a window to come to us. Indeed! said\nMrs. Peters;--and my master's back being turned, says she, Lady Davers,\nwhen a maiden, was always vastly passionate; but a very good lady when\nher passion was over. And she'd make nothing of slapping her maids\nabout, and begging their pardons afterwards, if they took it patiently;\notherwise she used to say the creatures were even with her.\n\nAy, said I, I have been a many creatures and wenches, and I know not\nwhat; for these were the names she gave me. And I thought I ought to\nact up to the part her dear brother has given me; and so I have but just\nescaped a good cuffing.\n\nMiss Boroughs said to her sister, as I overheard, but she did not design\nI should, What a sweet creature is this! and then she takes so little\nupon her, is so free, so easy, and owns the honour done her, so\nobligingly! said Mr. Perry, softly, The loveliest person I ever saw! Who\ncould have the heart to be angry with her one moment?\n\nSays Miss Darnford, Here, my dearest neighbour, these gentry are\nadmiring you strangely; and Mr. Perry says, you are the loveliest lady\nhe ever saw; and he says it to his own mistress's face too, I'll assure\nyou!--Or else, says Miss Boroughs, I should think he much flattered me.\n\nO, madam, you are exceedingly obliging! but your kind opinion ought to\nteach me humility, and to reverence so generous a worth as can give a\npreference against yourself, where it is so little due. Indeed, madam,\nsaid Miss Nanny Boroughs, I love my sister well; but it would be a high\ncompliment to any lady, to be deemed worthy a second or third place\nafter you.\n\nThere is no answering such politeness, said I: I am sure Lady Davers\nwas very cruel to keep me from such company. 'Twas our loss, madam, says\nMiss Darnford. I'll allow it, said I, in degree; for you have all been\ndeprived, several hours, of an humble admirer.\n\nMr. Perry said, I never before saw so young a lady shine forth with such\ngraces of mind and person. Alas! sir, said I, my master coming up, mine\nis but a borrowed shine, like that of the moon. Here is the sun, to\nwhose fervent glow of generosity I owe all the faint lustre, that your\ngoodness is pleased to look upon with so much kind distinction.\n\nMr. Perry was pleased to hold up his hands; and the ladies looked upon\none another. And my master said, hearing part of the last sentence,\nWhat's the pretty subject, that my Pamela is displaying so sweetly her\ntalents upon?\n\nOh! sir, said Mr. Perry, I will pronounce you the happiest man in\nEngland: and so said they all.\n\nMy master said, most generously, Thank ye, thank ye, thank ye, all\nround, my dear friends. I know not your subject; but if you believe\nme so, for a single instance of this dear girl's goodness, what must I\nthink myself, when blessed with a thousand instances, and experiencing\nit in every single act and word! I do assure you my Pamela's person,\nall lovely as you see it, is far short of her mind: That, indeed,\nfirst attracted my admiration, and made me her lover: but they were\nthe beauties of her mind, that made me her husband; and proud, my sweet\ndear, said he, pressing my hand, am I of that title.\n\nWell, said Mr. Perry, very kindly and politely, excellent as your lady\nis, I know not the gentleman that could deserve her, but that one who\ncould say such just and such fine things.\n\nI was all abashed; and took Miss Darnford's hand, and said, Save me,\ndear miss, by your sweet example, from my rising pride. But could I\ndeserve half these kind things, what a happy creature should I be! said\nMiss Darnford, You deserve them all, indeed you do.\n\nThe greatest part of the company having sat down to loo, my master being\npressed, said he would take one game at whist; but had rather be excused\ntoo, having been up all night: and I asked how his friend did? We'll\ntalk of that, said he, another time; which, and his seriousness, made me\nfear the poor gentleman was dead, as it proved.\n\nWe cast in, and Miss Boroughs and my master were together, and Mr. Perry\nand I; and I had all four honours the first time, and we were up at\none deal. Said my master, An honourable hand, Pamela, should go with an\nhonourable heart; but you'd not have been up, if a knave had not been\none. Whist, sir, said Mr. Perry, you know, was a court game originally;\nand the knave, I suppose, signified always the prime minister.\n\n'Tis well, said my master, if now there is but one knave in a court, out\nof four persons, take the court through.\n\nThe king and queen, sir, said Mr. Perry, can do no wrong, you know. So\nthere are two that must be good out of four; and the ace seems too plain\na card to mean much hurt.\n\nWe compliment the king, said my master, in that manner; and 'tis well to\ndo so, because there is something sacred in the character. But yet, if\nforce of example be considered, it is going a great way; for certainly a\ngood master makes a good servant, generally speaking.\n\nOne thing, added he, I will say, in regard to the ace: I have always\nlooked upon that plain and honest looking card in the light you do: and\nhave considered whist as an English game in its original; which has made\nme fonder of it than of any other. For by the ace I have always thought\nthe laws of the land denoted; and as the ace is above the king or queen,\nand wins them, I think the law should be thought so too; though, may be,\nI shall be deemed a Whig for my opinion.\n\nI shall never play whist, said Mr. Perry, without thinking of this,\nand shall love the game the better for the thought; though I am no\nparty-man. Nor I, said my master; for I think the distinctions of whig\nand tory odious; and love the one or the other only as they are honest\nand worthy men; and have never (nor never shall, hope) given a vote, but\naccording to what I thought was for the public good, let either whig or\ntory propose it.\n\nI wish, sir, replied Mr. Perry, all gentlemen in your station would act\nso. If there was no undue influence, said my master, I am willing to\nthink so well of all mankind, that I believe they generally would.\n\nBut you see, said he, by my Pamela's hand, when all the court-cards\nget together, and are acted by one mind, the game is usually turned\naccordingly: Though now and then, too, it may be so circumstanced, that\nhonours will do them no good, and they are forced to depend altogether\nupon tricks.\n\nI thought this way of talking prettier than the game itself. But I\nsaid, Though I have won the game, I hope I am no trickster. No, said my\nmaster, God forbid but court-cards should sometimes win with honour! But\nyou see, for all that, your game is as much owing to the knave as the\nking; and you, my fair-one, lost no advantage, when it was put into your\npower.\n\nElse, sir, said I, I should not have done justice to my partner. You\nare certainly right, Pamela, replied he; though you thereby beat your\nhusband. Sir, said I, you may be my partner next, and I must do justice,\nyou know. Well, said he, always choose so worthy a friend, as chance has\ngiven you for a partner, and I shall never find fault with you, do what\nyou will.\n\nMr. Perry said, You are very good to me, sir; and Miss Boroughs, I\nobserved, seemed pleased with the compliment to her humble servant; by\nwhich I saw she esteemed him, as he appears to deserve. Dear sir! said\nI, how much better is this, than to be locked in by Lady Davers!\n\nThe supper was brought in sooner on my account, because I had had no\ndinner; and there passed very agreeable compliments on the occasion.\nLady Darnford would help me first, because I had so long fasted, as she\nsaid. Sir Simon would have placed himself next me: And my master said,\nHe thought it was best, where there was an equal number of ladies and\ngentlemen, that they should sit, intermingled, that the gentlemen might\nbe employed in helping and serving the ladies. Lady Darnford said,\nShe hoped Sir Simon would not sit above any ladies at his own table\nespecially. Well, said he, I shall sit over-against her, however, and\nthat's as well.\n\nMy dearest sir could not keep his eyes off me, and seemed generously\ndelighted with all I did, and all I said; and every one was pleased to\nsee his kind and affectionate behaviour to me.\n\nLady Jones brought up the discourse about Lady Davers again; and my\nmaster said, I fear, Pamela, you have been hardly used, more than you'll\nsay. I know my sister's passionate temper too well, to believe she could\nbe over-civil to you, especially as it happened so unluckily that I was\nout. If, added he, she had no pique to you, my dear, yet what has passed\nbetween her and me, has so exasperated her, that I know she would have\nquarrelled with my horse, if she had thought I valued it, and nobody\nelse was in her way. Dear sir, said I, don't say so of good Lady Davers.\n\nWhy, my dear, said he, I know she came on purpose to quarrel; and had\nshe not found herself under a very violent uneasiness, after what had\npassed between us, and my treatment of her lord's letter, she would\nnot have offered to come near me. What sort of language had she for me,\nPamela? O sir, very good, only her well-mannered brother, and such as\nthat!\n\nOnly, said he, 'tis taking up the attention of the company disagreeably,\nor I could tell you almost every word she said. Lady Jones wished to\nhear a further account of my lady's conduct, and most of the company\njoined with her, particularly Mrs. Peters; who said, that as they knew\nthe story, and Lady Davers's temper, though she was very good in the\nmain, they could wish to be so agreeably entertained, if he and I\npleased; because they imagined I should have no difficulties after this.\n\nTell me, then, Pamela, said he, did she lift up her hand at you? Did\nshe strike you? But I hope not! A little slap of the hand, said I, or\nso.--Insolent woman! She did not, I hope, offer to strike your face?\nWhy, said I, I was a little saucy once or twice; and she would have\ngiven me a cuff on the ear, if her woman and Mrs. Jewkes had not\ninterposed. Why did you not come out at the door? Because, said I,\nher ladyship sat in the chair against it, one while, and another while\nlocked it; else I offered several times to get away.\n\nShe knew I expected you here: You say, you shewed her my letter to\nyou? Yes, sir, said I; but I had better not; for she as then more\nexasperated, and made strange comments upon it. I doubt it not, said he;\nbut, did she not see, by the kind epithets in it, that there was no room\nto doubt of our being married? O, sir, replied I, and made the company\nsmile, she said, For that very reason she was sure I was not married.\n\nThat's like my sister! said he; exactly like her; and yet she lives\nvery happily herself: for her poor lord never contradicts her. Indeed he\ndares not.\n\nYou were a great many wenches, were you not, my dear? for that's a great\nword with her.--Yes, sir, said I, wenches and creatures out of number;\nand worse than all that. What? tell me, my dear. Sir, said I, I must not\nhave you angry with Lady Davers; while you are so good to me, 'tis all\nnothing; only the trouble I have that I cannot be suffered to shew how\nmuch I honoured her ladyship, as your sister.\n\nWell, said he, you need not be afraid to tell me: I must love her after\nall; though I shall not be pleased with her on this occasion. I know\nit is her love for me, though thus oddly expressed, that makes her so\nuneasy: and, after all, she comes, I'm sure, to be reconciled to me;\nthough it must be through a good hearty quarrel first: for she can shew\na good deal of sunshine; but it must be always after a storm; and I'll\nlove her dearly, if she has not been, and will not be, too hard upon my\ndearest.\n\nMr. Peters said, Sir, you are very good, and very kind; I love to see\nthis complaisance to your sister, though she be in fault, so long as you\ncan shew it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit\nin the world. By all that's good, Mr. Peters, said he, I'd present my\nsister with a thousand pounds, if she would kindly take my dear Pamela\nby the hand, and wish her joy, and call her sister!--And yet I should be\nunworthy of the dear creature that smiles upon me there, if it was not\nprincipally for her sake, and the pleasure it would give her, that I say\nthis: for I will never be thoroughly reconciled to my sister till she\ndoes; for I most sincerely think, as to myself, that my dear wife, there\nshe sits, does me more honour in her new relation, than she receives\nfrom me.\n\nSir, said I, I am overwhelmed with your goodness!--And my eyes were\nfilled with tears of joy and gratitude: and all the company with one\nvoice blessed him. And Lady Jones was pleased to say, The behaviour of\nyou two happy ones, to each other, is the most edifying I ever knew. I\nam always improved when I see you. How happy would every good lady be\nwith such a gentleman, and every good gentleman with such a lady!--In\nshort, you seem made for one another.\n\nO madam, said I, you are so kind, so good to me, that I know not how to\nthank you enough!--Said she, You deserve more than I can express; for,\nto all that know your story, you are a matchless person. You are an\nornament to our sex and your virtue, though Mr. B---- is so generous\nas he is, has met with no more than its due reward. God long bless you\ntogether!\n\nYou are, said my dearest sir, very good to me, madam, I am sure. I have\ntaken liberties in my former life, that deserved not so much excellence.\nI have offended extremely, by trials glorious to my Pamela, but\ndisgraceful to me, against a virtue that I now consider as almost\nsacred; and I shall not think I deserve her, till I can bring my\nmanners, my sentiments, and my actions, to a conformity with her own.\nIn short, my Pamela, continued he, I want you to be nothing but what you\nare, and have been. You cannot be better; and if you could, it would\nbe but filling me with despair to attain the awful heights of virtue at\nwhich you have arrived. Perhaps, added the dear gentleman, the scene\nI have beheld within these twelve hours, has made me more serious than\notherwise I should have been: but I'll assure you, before all this good\ncompany, I speak the sentiments of my heart, and those not of this day\nonly.\n\nWhat a happy daughter is yours, O my dear father and mother! I owe it\nall to God's grace, and to yours and my good lady's instructions: And to\nthese let me always look back with grateful acknowledgments, that I may\nnot impute to myself, and be proud, my inexpressible happiness.\n\nThe company were so kindly pleased with our concern, and my dear\nmaster's goodness, that he, observing their indulgence, and being\nhimself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed\nbetween my lady and me, repeated his question, What she had called me\nbesides wench and creature? And I said, My lady, supposing I was wicked,\nlamented over me, very kindly, my depravity and fall, and said, What a\nthousand pities it was, so much virtue, as she was pleased to say, was\nso destroyed; and that I had yielded, after so noble a stand! as she\nsaid.\n\nExcuse me, gentlemen and ladies, said I! you know my story, it seems;\nand I am commanded, by one who has a title to all my obedience, to\nproceed.\n\nThey gave all of them bows of approbation, that they might not interrupt\nme; and I continued my story--the men-servants withdrawing, at a motion\nof Mr. B----, on my looking towards them: and then, at Lady Darnford's\ncoming in, I proceeded.\n\nI told her ladyship, that I was still innocent, and would be so, and\nit was injurious to suppose me otherwise. Why, tell me, wench, said\nshe--But I think I must not tell you what she said. Yes, do, said my\nmaster, to clear my sister; we shall think it very bad else.\n\nI held my hand before my face--Why, she said, Tell me, wench, hast thou\nnot been--hesitating--a very free creature with thy master? That she\nsaid, or to that effect--And when I said, She asked strange questions,\nand in strange words, she ridiculed my delicacy, as she called it; and\nsaid, My niceness would not last long. She said, I must know I was not\nreally married, that my ring was only a sham, and all was my cunning to\ncloak my yielding, and get better terms. She said, She knew the world as\nmuch at thirty-two, as I did at sixteen; and bid me remember that.\n\nI took the liberty to say, (but I got a good way off,) that I scorned\nher ladyship's words, and was as much married as her ladyship. And then\nI had certainly been cuffed, if her woman had not interposed, and told\nher I was not worthy her anger; and that I was as much to be pitied for\nmy credulity, as despised for my vanity.\n\nMy poor Pamela, said my master, this was too, too hard upon you! O sir,\nsaid I, how much easier it was to me than if it had been so!--That would\nhave broken my heart quite!--For then I should have deserved it all, and\nworse; and these reproaches, added to my own guilt, would have made me\ntruly wretched!\n\nLady Darnford, at whose right-hand I sat, kissed me with a kind of\nrapture, and called me a sweet exemplar for all my sex. Mr. Peters said\nvery handsome things; so did Mr. Perry and Sir Simon, with tears in his\neyes, said to my master, Why, neighbour, neighbour, this is excellent,\nby my troth. I believe there is something in virtue, that we had not\nwell considered. On my soul, there has been but one angel come down for\nthese thousand years, and you have got her.\n\nWell, my dearest, said my master, pray proceed with your story until, we\nhave done supper, since the ladies seem pleased with it. Why, sir, said\nI, her ladyship went on in the same manner; but said, one time, (and\nheld me by the hand,) she would give me an hundred guineas for one\nprovoking word; or, if I would but say I believed myself married, that\nshe might fell me at her foot: But, sir, you must not be angry with her\nladyship. She called me painted dirt, baby-face, waiting-maid, beggar's\nbrat, and beggar-born; but I said, As long as I knew my innocence, I was\neasy in every thing, but to have my dear parents abused. They were never\nbeggars, nor beholden to any body; nor to any thing but God's grace and\ntheir own labour; that they once lived in credit; that misfortunes might\nbefall any body; and that I could not bear they should be treated so\nundeservedly.\n\nThen her ladyship said, Ay, she supposed my master's folly would make\nus set up for a family, and that the heralds' office would shortly be\nsearched to make it out.\n\nExactly my sister again! said he. So you could not please her any way?\n\nNo, indeed, sir. When she commanded me to fill her a glass of wine,\nand would not let her woman do it, she asked, If I was above it? I then\nsaid, If to attend your ladyship at table, or even kneel at your feet,\nwas required of me, I would most gladly do it, were I only the person\nyou think me. But if it be to triumph over one, who has received honours\nwhich she thinks require from her another part, that she may not\nbe utterly unworthy of them, I must say, I cannot do it. This quite\nastonished her ladyship; and a little before, her kinsman brought me\nthe bottle and glass, and required me to fill it for my lady, at her\ncommand, and called himself my deputy: And I said, 'Tis in a good hand;\nhelp my lady yourself. So, sir, added I, you see I could be a little\nsaucy upon occasion.\n\nYou please me well, my Pamela, said he. This was quite right. But\nproceed.\n\nHer ladyship said, She was astonished! adding, She supposed I would have\nher look upon me as her brother's wife: And asked me, What, in the name\nof impudence, possessed me, to dare to look upon myself as her sister?\nAnd I said, That was a question better became her most worthy brother to\nanswer, than me. And then I thought I should have had her ladyship upon\nme; but her woman interposed.\n\nI afterwards told Mrs. Jewkes, at the window, that since I was hindered\nfrom going to you, I believed it was best to let Robert go with the\nchariot, and say, Lady Davers was come, and I could not leave her\nladyship. But this did not please; and I thought it would too; for she\nsaid, No, no, he'll think I make the creature my companion, and know not\nhow to part with her.\n\nExactly, said he, my sister again.\n\nAnd she said, I knew nothing what belonged to people of condition; how\nshould I?--What shall I say, madam? said I. Nothing at all, answered\nshe; let him expect his dearest love, alluding to your kind epithet in\nyour letter, and be disappointed; it is but adding a few more hours\nto this heavy absence, and every one will become a day in his amorous\naccount.\n\nSo, to be short, I saw nothing was to be done; and I feared, sir, you\nwould wonder at my stay, and be angry; and I watched my opportunity,\ntill my lady, who was walking about the room, was at the further end;\nand the parlour being a ground-floor, in a manner, I jumped out at the\nwindow, and ran for it.\n\nHer ladyship called after me; so did her woman; and I heard her say, I\nflew like a bird; and she called two of her servants in sight to stop\nme; but I said, Touch me at your peril, fellows! And Mr. Colbrand,\nhaving been planted at hand by Mrs. Jewkes, (who was very good in the\nwhole affair, and incurred her ladyship's displeasure, once or twice, by\ntaking my part,) seeing how I was used, put on a fierce look, cocked\nhis hat with one hand, and put t'other on his sword, and said, he would\nchine the man who offered to touch his lady. And so he ran alongside\nof me, and could hardly keep pace with me:--And here, my dear sir,\nconcluded I, I am, at yours and the good company's service.\n\nThey seemed highly pleased with my relation; and my master said, he was\nglad Mrs. Jewkes behaved so well, as also Mr. Colbrand. Yes, sir, said\nI: when Mrs. Jewkes interposed once, her ladyship said, It was hard,\nshe, who was born in that house, could not have some privilege in\nit, without being talked to by the saucy servants. And she called her\nanother time fat-face, and womaned her most violently.\n\nWell, said my master, I am glad, my dear, you have had such an escape.\nMy sister was always passionate, as Mrs. Peters knows: And my poor\nmother had enough to do with us both. For we neither of us wanted\nspirit: and when I was a boy, I never came home from school or college\nfor a few days, but though we longed to see one another before, yet ere\nthe first day was over, we had a quarrel; for she, being seven years\nolder than I, was always for domineering over me, and I could not bear\nit. And I used, on her frequently quarrelling with the maids, and being\nalways at a word and a blow, to call her Captain Bab; for her name is\nBarbara. And when my Lord Davers courted her, my poor mother has made up\nquarrels between them three times in a day; and I used to tell her, she\nwould certainly beat her husband, marry whom she would, if he did not\nbeat her first, and break her spirit.\n\nYet has she, continued he, very good qualities. She was a dutiful\ndaughter, is a good wife; she is bountiful to her servants, firm in her\nfriendships, charitable to the poor, and, I believe, never any sister\nbetter loved a brother, than she me: and yet she always loved to vex and\ntease me; and as I would bear a resentment longer than she, she'd be one\nmoment the most provoking creature in the world, and the next would\ndo any thing to be forgiven; and I have made her, when she was the\naggressor, follow me all over the house and garden to be upon good terms\nwith me.\n\nBut this case piques her more, because she had found out a match for\nme in the family of a person of quality, and had set her heart upon\nbringing it to effect, and had even proceeded far in it, without my\nknowledge, and brought me into the lady's company, unknowing of her\ndesign. But I was then averse to matrimony upon any terms; and was angry\nat her proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement: And\nshe cannot, for this reason, bear the thoughts of my being now married,\nand to her mother's waiting-maid too, as she reminds my dear Pamela,\nwhen I had declined her proposal with the daughter of a noble earl.\n\nThis is the whole case, said he; and, allowing for the pride\nand violence of her spirit, and that she knows not, as I do, the\ntranscendent excellencies of my dear Pamela, and that all her view, in\nher own conception, is mine and the family honour, she is a little to be\nallowed for: Though, never fear, my Pamela, but that I, who never had\na struggle with her, wherein I did not get the better, will do you\njustice, and myself too.\n\nThis account of Lady Davers pleased every body, and was far from being\nto her ladyship's disadvantage in the main; and I would do any thing\nin the world to have the honour to be in her good graces: Yet I fear it\nwill not be easily, if at all, effected. But I will proceed.\n\nAfter supper, nothing would serve Miss Darnford and Miss Boroughs, but\nwe must have a dance; and Mr. Peters, who plays a good fiddle, urged\nit forward. My dear master, though in a riding-dress, took out Miss\nBoroughs.\n\nSir Simon, for a man of his years, danced well, and took me out; but put\non one of his free jokes, that I was fitter to dance with a younger\nman; and he would have it, (though I had not danced since my dear lady's\ndeath to signify, except once or twice to please Mrs. Jervis, and,\nindeed, believed all my dancing days over,) that as my master and I were\nthe best dancers, we should dance once together, before folks, as the\nodd gentleman said; and my dear sir was pleased to oblige him: And\nafterwards danced with Miss Darnford, who has much more skill and\njudgment than I; though they compliment me with an easier shape and air.\n\nWe left the company with great difficulty at about eleven, my dear\nmaster having been up all night before, and we being at the greatest\ndistance from home; though they seemed inclinable not to break up so\nsoon, as they were neighbours; and the ladies said, They longed to hear\nwhat would be the end of Lady Davers's interview with her brother.\n\nMy master said, He feared we must not now think of going next day to\nBedfordshire, as we had intended; and perhaps might see them again. And\nso we took leave, and set out for home; where we arrived not till twelve\no'clock; and found Lady Davers had gone to bed about eleven, wanting\nsadly that we should come home first; but so did not I.\n\nMrs. Jewkes told us, That my lady was sadly fretted that I had got away\nso; and seemed a little apprehensive of what I would say of the usage\nI had received from her. She asked Mrs. Jewkes, if she thought I\nwas really married? And Mrs. Jewkes telling her yes, she fell into a\npassion, and said, Begone, bold woman, I cannot bear thee! See not my\nface till I send for thee! Thou hast been very impudent to me once or\ntwice to-day already, and art now worse than ever. She said, She would\nnot have told her ladyship, if she had not asked her; and was sorry she\nhad offended.\n\nShe sent for her at supper time: Said she, I have another question to\nask thee, woman, and tell me yes, if thou darest. Was ever any thing so\nodd?--Why then, said Mrs. Jewkes, I will say No, before your ladyship\nspeaks.--My master laughed: Poor woman! said he.--She called her\ninsolent, and assurance; and said, Begone, bold woman as thou art!--but\ncome hither. Dost thou know if that young harlot is to be with my\nbrother to-night?\n\nShe said she knew not what to answer, because she had threatened her if\nshe said yes. But at last my lady said, I will know the bottom of this\niniquity. I suppose they won't have so much impudence to be together\nwhile I'm in the house; but I dare say they have been bed-fellows.\n\nSaid she, I will lie to-night in the room I was born in; so get that\nbed ready. That room being our bedchamber, Mrs. Jewkes, after some\nhesitation, replied, Madam, my master lies there, and has the key. I\nbelieve, woman, said she, thou tellest me a story. Indeed, madam, said\nshe, he does; and has some papers there he will let nobody see; for Mrs.\nJewkes said, she feared she would beat her if she went up, and found by\nmy clothes, and some of my master's, how it was.\n\nSo she said, I will then lie in the best room, as it is called; and\nJackey shall lie in the little green room adjoining to it. Has thy\nmaster got the keys of those?--No, madam, said Mrs. Jewkes: I will order\nthem to be made ready for your ladyship.\n\nAnd where dost thou lay the pursy sides? said she. Up two pair of\nstairs, madam, next the garden. And where lies the young harlotry?\ncontinued she. Sometimes with me, madam, said she. And sometimes with\nthy virtuous master, I suppose? said my lady.--Ha, woman! what sayest\nthou? I must not speak, said Mrs. Jewkes. Well, thou mayest go, said\nshe; but thou hast the air of a secret keeper of that sort I dare say\nthoul't set the good work forward most cordially. Poor Mrs. Jewkes, said\nmy master, and laughed most heartily.\n\nThis talk we had whilst we were undressing. So she and her woman lay\ntogether in the room my master lay in before I was happy.\n\nI said, Dear sir, pray, in the morning let me lock myself up in the\ncloset, as soon as you rise; and not be called down for ever so much;\nfor I am afraid to see her ladyship: And I will employ myself about my\njournal, while these things are in my head. Don't be afraid, my dear,\nsaid he: Am not I with you?\n\nMrs. Jewkes pitied me for what I had undergone in the day; and I said,\nWe won't make the worst of it to my dear master, because we won't\nexasperate where we would reconcile: but, added I, I am much obliged to\nyou, Mrs. Jewkes, and I thank you. Said my master, I hope she did not\nbeat your lady, Mrs. Jewkes? Not much, sir, said she; but I believe I\nsaved my lady once: Yet, added she, I was most vexed at the young\nlord. Ay, Mrs. Jewkes, said my master, let me know his behaviour. I\ncan chastise him, though I cannot my sister, who is a woman; let me\ntherefore know the part he acted.\n\nNothing, my dear sir, said I, but impertinence, if I may so say, and\nfoolishness, that was very provoking; but I spared him not; and so there\nis no room, sir, for your anger. No, sir, said Mrs. Jewkes, nothing else\nindeed.\n\nHow was her woman? said my master. Pretty impertinent, replied Mrs.\nJewkes, as ladies' women will be. But, said I, you know she saved me\nonce or twice. Very true, madam, returned Mrs. Jewkes. And she said to\nme at table, that you were a sweet creature; she never saw your equal;\nbut that you had a spirit; and she was sorry you answered her lady so,\nwho never bore so much contradiction before. I told her, added Mrs.\nJewkes, that if I was in your ladyship's place, I should have taken much\nmore upon me, and that you were all sweetness. And she said, I was got\nover, she saw.\n\n\nTuesday morning, the sixth of my happiness.\n\nMy master had said to Mrs. Jewkes, that he should not rise till eight\nor nine, as he had sat up all the night before: but it seems, my lady,\nknowing he usually rose about six, got up soon after that hour; raised\nher woman and her nephew; having a whimsical scheme in her head, to try\nto find whether we were in bed together: And, about half an hour after\nsix, she rapped at our chamber door.\n\nMy master was waked at the noise, and asked, Who was there? Open the\ndoor, said she; open it this minute! I said, clinging about his neck,\nDear, dear sir, pray, pray don't!--O save me, save me! Don't fear,\nPamela, said he. The woman's mad, I believe.\n\nBut he called out; Who are you? What do you want?--You know my voice\nwell enough, said she:--I will come in.--Pray, sir, said I, don't let\nher ladyship in.--Don't be frightened, my dear, said he; she thinks we\nare not married, and are afraid to be found a-bed together. I'll let her\nin; but she shan't come near my dearest.\n\nSo he slipt out of bed, and putting on some of his clothes, and gown\nand slippers, he said, What bold body dare disturb my repose thus? and\nopened the door. In rushed she: I'll see your wickedness, said she, I\nwill! In vain shall you think to hide it from me.--What should I hide?\nsaid he. How dare you set a foot into my house, after the usage I\nhave received from you?--I had covered myself over head and ears, and\ntrembled every joint. He looked, and 'spied her woman and kinsman in\nthe room, she crying out, Bear witness, Jackey; bear witness, Beck; the\ncreature is now in his bed! And not seeing the young gentleman before,\nwho was at the feet of the bed, he said, How now, sir? What's your\nbusiness in this apartment? Begone this moment!--And he went away\ndirectly.\n\nBeck, said my lady, you see the creature is in his bed. I do, madam,\nanswered she. My master came to me, and said, Ay, look, Beck, and bear\nwitness: Here is my Pamela!--My dear angel, my lovely creature, don't be\nafraid; look up, and see how frantickly this woman of quality behaves.\n\nAt that, I just peeped, and saw my lady, who could not bear this, coming\nto me; and she said, Wicked abandoned wretch! Vile brother, to brave me\nthus! I'll tear the creature out of bed before your face, and expose you\nboth as you deserve.\n\nAt that he took her in his arms, as if she had been nothing; and\ncarrying her out of the room, she cried out, Beck! Beck! help me, Beck!\nthe wretch is going to fling me down stairs! Her woman ran to him,\nand said, Good sir, for Heaven's sake do no violence to my lady! Her\nladyship has been ill all night.\n\nHe sat her down in the chamber she lay in, and she could not speak for\npassion. Take care of your lady, said he; and when she has rendered\nherself more worthy of my attention, I'll see her; till then, at her\nperil, and yours too, come not near my apartment. And so he came to me,\nand, with all the sweet soothing words in the world, pacified my fears,\nand gave me leave to go to write in my closet, as soon as my fright was\nover, and to stay there till things were more calm. And so he dressed\nhimself, and went out of the chamber, permitting me, at my desire, to\nfasten the door after him.\n\nAt breakfast-time my master tapped at the door, and I said, Who's\nthere? I, my dearest, said he. Oh! then, replied I, I will open it with\npleasure. I had written on a good deal; but I put it by, when I ran to\nthe door. I would have locked it again, when he was in; but he said, Am\nnot I here? Don't be afraid. Said he, Will you come down to breakfast,\nmy love? O no, dear sir, said I; be pleased to excuse me! said he,\nI cannot bear the look of it, that the mistress of my house should\nbreakfast in her closet, as if she durst not come down, and I at\nhome!--O, dearest sir, replied I, pray pass that over, for my sake; and\ndon't let my presence aggravate your sister, for a kind punctilio! Then,\nmy dear, said he, I will breakfast with you here. No, pray, dear sir,\nanswered I, breakfast with your sister. That, my dear, replied he, will\ntoo much gratify her pride, and look like a slight to you.--Dear sir,\nsaid I, your goodness is too great, for me to want punctilious proofs of\nit. Pray oblige her ladyship. She is your guest surely, sir, you may be\nfreest with your dutiful wife!\n\nShe is a strange woman, said he: How I pity her!--She has thrown herself\ninto a violent fit of the colic, through passion: And is but now, her\nwoman says, a little easier. I hope, sir, said I, when you carried her\nladyship out, you did not hurt her. No, replied he, I love her too well.\nI set her down in the apartment she had chosen: and she but now desires\nto see me, and that I will breakfast with her, or refuses to touch any\nthing. But, if my dearest please, I will insist it shall be with you at\nthe same time.\n\nO, no, no, dear sir! said I; I should not forgive myself, if I did. I\nwould on my knees beg her ladyship's goodness to me, now I am in your\npresence; though I thought I ought to carry it a little stiff when you\nwere absent, for the sake of the honour you have done me. And, dear sir,\nif my deepest humility will please, permit me to shew it.\n\nYou shall do nothing, returned he, unworthy of my wife, to please the\nproud woman!--But I will, however, permit you to breakfast by yourself\nthis once, as I have not seen her since I have used her in so barbarous\na manner, as I understand she exclaims I have; and as she will not\neat any thing, unless I give her my company.--So he saluted me, and\nwithdrew; and I locked the door after him again for fear.\n\nMrs. Jewkes soon after rapped at the door. Who's there? said I. Only\nI, madam. So I opened the door. 'Tis a sad thing, madam, said she,\nyou should be so much afraid in your own house. She brought me some\nchocolate and toast; and I asked her about my lady's behaviour. She\nsaid, she would not suffer any body to attend but her woman, because she\nwould not be heard what she had to say; but she believed, she said, her\nmaster was very angry with the young lord, as she called her kinsman;\nfor, as she passed by the door, she heard him say, in a high tone, I\nhope, sir, you did not forget what belongs to the character you assume;\nor to that effect.\n\nAbout one o'clock my master came up again, and he said, Will you come\ndown to dinner, Pamela, when I send for you? Whatever you command, sir,\nI must do. But my lady won't desire to see me. No matter whether she\nwill or no. But I will not suffer, that she shall prescribe her insolent\nwill to my wife, and in your own house too.--I will, by my tenderness to\nyou, mortify her pride; and it cannot be done so well as to her face.\n\nDearest sir, said I, pray indulge me, and let me dine here by myself. It\nwill make my lady but more inveterate.--Said he, I have told her we are\nmarried. She is out of all patience about it, and yet pretends not to\nbelieve it. Upon that I tell her, Then she shall have it her own way,\nand that I am not. And what has she to do with it either way? She has\nscolded and begged, commanded and prayed, blessed me, and cursed me,\nby turns, twenty times in these few hours. And I have sometimes soothed\nher, sometimes raged; and at last left her, and took a turn in the\ngarden for an hour to compose myself, because you should not see how the\nfoolish woman has ruffled me; and just now I came out, seeing her coming\nin.\n\nJust as he had said so, I cried, Oh! my lady, my lady! for I heard\nher voice in the chamber, saying, Brother, brother, one word with\nyou--stopping in sight of the closet where I was. He stepped out, and\nshe went up to the window that looks towards the garden, and said, Mean\nfool that I am, to follow you up and down the house in this manner,\nthough I am shunned and avoided by you! You a brother!--You a barbarian!\nIs it possible we could be born of one mother?\n\nWhy, said he, do you charge me with a conduct to you, that you bring\nupon yourself?--Is it not surprising that you should take the liberty\nwith me, that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example\nfor to any of her relations?--Was it not sufficient, that I was\ninsolently taken to task by you in your letters, but my retirements must\nbe invaded? My house insulted? And, if I have one person dearer to me\nthan another, that that person must be singled out for an object of your\nviolence?\n\nAy, said she, that one person is the thing!--But though I came with a\nresolution to be temperate, and to expostulate with you on your avoiding\nme so unkindly, yet cannot I have patience to look upon that bed in\nwhich I was born, and to be made the guilty scene of your wickedness\nwith such a----\n\nHush! said he, I charge you! call not the dear girl by any name unworthy\nof her. You know not, as I told you, her excellence; and I desire you'll\nnot repeat the freedoms you have taken below.\n\nShe stamped with her foot, and said, God give me patience! So much\ncontempt to a sister that loves you so well; and so much tenderness to a\nvile----\n\nHe put his hand before her mouth: Be silent, said he, once more, I\ncharge you! You know not the innocence you abuse so freely. I ought not,\nneither will I bear it.\n\nShe sat down and fanned herself, and burst into tears, and such sobs\nof grief, or rather passion, that grieved me to hear; and I sat and\ntrembled sadly.\n\nHe walked about the room in great anger; and at last said, Let me ask\nyou, Lady Davers, why I am thus insolently to be called to account\nby you? Am I not independent? Am I not of age? Am I not at liberty to\nplease myself?--Would to God, that, instead of a woman, and my sister,\nany man breathing had dared, whatever were his relation under that of\na father, to give himself half the airs you have done!--Why did you not\nsend on this accursed errand your lord, who could write me such a letter\nas no gentleman should write, nor any gentleman tamely receive? He\nshould have seen the difference.\n\nWe all know, said she, that, since your Italian duel, you have commenced\na bravo; and all your airs breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of\nthe libertine. This, said he, I will bear; for I have no reason to\nbe ashamed of that duel, nor the cause of it; since it was to save a\nfriend, and because it is levelled at myself only: but suffer not your\ntongue to take too great a liberty with my Pamela.\n\nShe interrupted him in a violent burst of passion. If I bear this, said\nshe, I can bear any thing!--O the little strumpet!--He interrupted her\nthen, and said wrathfully, Begone, rageful woman! begone this moment\nfrom my presence! Leave my house this instant!--I renounce you, and\nall relation to you! and never more let me see your face, or call me\nbrother! And took her by the hand to lead her out. She laid hold of the\ncurtains of the window, and said, I will not go! You shall not force me\nfrom you thus ignominiously in the wretch's hearing, and suffer her to\ntriumph over me in your barbarous treatment of me.\n\nNot considering any thing, I ran out of the closet, and threw myself at\nmy dear master's feet, as he held her hand, in order to lead her out;\nand I said, Dearest sir, let me beg, that no act of unkindness, for my\nsake, pass between so worthy and so near relations. Dear, dear madam,\nsaid I, and clasped her knees, pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of\nall this evil; on my knees I beg your ladyship to receive me to your\ngrace and favour, and you shall find me incapable of any triumph but in\nyour ladyship's goodness to me.\n\nCreature, said she, art thou to beg an excuse for me?--Art thou to\nimplore my forgiveness? Is it to thee I am to owe the favour, that I\nam not cast headlong from my brother's presence? Begone to thy corner,\nwench! begone, I say, lest thy paramour kill me for trampling thee under\nmy foot!\n\nRise, my dear Pamela, said my master; rise, dear life of my life; and\nexpose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a\nspirit. And so he led me to my closet again, and there I sat and wept.\n\nHer woman came up, just as he had led me to my closet, and was returning\nto her lady; and she very humbly said, Excuse my intrusion, good sir!--I\nhope I may come to my lady. Yes, Mrs. Worden, said he, you may come in;\nand pray take your lady down stairs with you, for fear I should too much\nforget what belongs either to my sister or myself!\n\nI began to think (seeing her ladyship so outrageous with her brother)\nwhat a happy escape I had had the day before, though hardly enough used\nin conscience too, as I thought.\n\nHer woman begged her ladyship to walk down; and she said, Beck, seest\nthou that bed? That was the bed that I was born in; and yet that was the\nbed thou sawest, as well as I, the wicked Pamela in, this morning, and\nthis brother of mine just risen from her!\n\nTrue, said he; you both saw it, and it is my pride that you could see\nit. 'Tis my bridal bed; and 'tis abominable that the happiness I knew\nbefore you came hither, should be so barbarously interrupted.\n\nSwear to me but, thou bold wretch! said she, swear to me, that Pamela\nAndrews is really and truly thy lawful wife, without sham, without\ndeceit, without double-meaning; and I know what I have to say!\n\nI'll humour you for once, said he; and then swore a solemn oath that I\nwas. And, said he, did I not tell you so at first?\n\nI cannot yet believe you, said she; because, in this particular, I had\nrather have called you knave than fool.--Provoke me not too much, said\nhe; for, if I should as much forget myself as you have done, you'd have\nno more of a brother in me, than I have a sister in you.\n\nWho married you? said she: tell me that! Was it not a broken attorney\nin a parson's habit? Tell me truly, in the wench's hearing. When she's\nundeceived, she'll know how to behave herself better! Thank God, thought\nI, it is not so.\n\nNo, said he; and I'll tell you, that I bless God, I abhorred that\nproject, before it was brought to bear: and Mr. Williams married\nus.--Nay then, said she--but answer me another question or two, I\nbeseech you: Who gave her away? Parson Peters, said he. Where was the\nceremony performed? In my little chapel, which you may see, as it was\nput in order on purpose.\n\nNow, said she, I begin to fear there is something in it! But who was\npresent? said she. Methinks, replied he, I look like a fine puppy, to\nsuffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent sister: but, if\nyou must know, Mrs. Jewkes was present. O the procuress! said she: But\nnobody else? Yes, said he, all my heart and soul!\n\nWretch! said she; and what would thy father and mother have said,\nhad they lived to this day? Their consents, replied he, I should have\nthought it my duty to ask; but not yours, madam.\n\nSuppose, said she, I had married my father's groom! what would you have\nsaid to that?--I could not have behaved worse, replied he, than you have\ndone. And would you not have thought, said she, I had deserved it.\n\nSaid he, Does your pride let you see no difference in the case you put?\nNone at all, said she. Where can the difference be between a beggar's\nson married by a lady, or a beggar's daughter made a gentleman's wife?\n\nThen I'll tell you, replied he; the difference is, a man ennobles the\nwoman he takes, be she who she will; and adopts her into his own rank,\nbe it what it will: but a woman, though ever so nobly born, debases\nherself by a mean marriage, and descends from her own rank to his she\nstoops to.\n\nWhen the royal family of Stuart allied itself into the low family of\nHyde, (comparatively low, I mean,) did any body scruple to call the\nlady, Royal Highness, and Duchess of York? And did any body think her\ndaughters, the late Queen Mary and Queen Anne, less royal for that?\n\nWhen the broken-fortuned peer goes into the city to marry a rich\ntradesman's daughter, be he duke or earl, does not his consort\nimmediately become ennobled by his choice? and who scruples to call her\nlady, duchess, or countess?\n\nBut when a duchess or countess dowager descends to mingle with a person\nof obscure birth, does she not then degrade herself? and is she not\neffectually degraded? And will any duchess or countess rank with her?\n\nNow, Lady Davers, do you not see a difference between my marrying my\ndear mother's beloved and deserving waiting-maid, with a million of\nexcellencies about her, and such graces of mind and person as would\nadorn any distinction; and your marrying a sordid groom, whose constant\ntrain of education, conversation, and opportunities, could possibly give\nhim no other merit, than that which must proceed from the vilest, lowest\ntaste, in his sordid dignifier?\n\nO the wretch! said she, how he finds excuses to palliate his meanness!\n\nAgain, said he, let me observe to you, Lady Davers, When a duke marries\na private person, is he not still her head, by virtue of being her\nhusband? But, when a lady descends to marry a groom, is not the groom\nher head, being her husband? And does not the difference strike you? For\nwhat lady of quality ought to respect another, who has made so sordid\na choice, and set a groom above her? For, would not that be to put that\ngroom upon a par with themselves?--Call this palliation, or what you\nwill; but if you see not the difference, you are blind; and a very unfit\njudge for yourself, much more unfit to be a censurer of me.\n\nI'd have you, said she, publish your fine reasons to the world, and they\nwill be sweet encouragements to all the young gentlemen who read them to\ncast themselves away on the servant-wenches in their families.\n\nNot at all, Lady Davers, replied he: For, if any young gentleman stays\ntill he finds such a person as my Pamela, so enriched with the beauties\nof person and mind, so well accomplished, and so fitted to adorn the\ndegree she is raised to, he will stand as easily acquitted, as I shall\nbe to all the world that sees her, except there be many more Lady Davers\nthan I apprehend can possibly be met with.\n\nAnd so, returned she, you say you are actually and really married,\nhonestly, or rather foolishly married, to this slut?\n\nI am, indeed, says he, if you presume to call her so! And why should I\nnot, if I please? Who is there ought to contradict me? Whom have I hurt\nby it?--Have I not an estate, free and independent?--Am I likely to\nbe beholden to you, or any of my relations? And why, when I have a\nsufficiency in my own single hands, should I scruple to make a woman\nequally happy, who has all I want? For beauty, virtue, prudence, and\ngenerosity too, I will tell you, she has more than any lady I ever saw.\nYes, Lady Davers, she has all these naturally; they are born with her;\nand a few years' education, with her genius, has done more for her, than\na whole life has done for others.\n\nNo more, no more, I beseech you, said she; thou surfeitest me, honest\nman! with thy weak folly. Thou art worse than an idolater; thou hast\nmade a graven image, and thou fallest down and worshippest the works of\nthy own hands; and, Jeroboam-like, wouldst have every body else bow down\nbefore thy calf!\n\nWell said, Lady Davers! Whenever your passion suffers you to descend\nto witticism; 'tis almost over with you. But let me tell you, though\nI myself worship this sweet creature, that you call such names, I want\nnobody else to do it; and should be glad you had not intruded upon me,\nto interrupt me in the course of our mutual happiness.\n\nWell said, well said, my kind, my well-mannered brother! said she. I\nshall, after this, very little interrupt your mutual happiness, I'll\nassure you. I thought you a gentleman once, and prided myself in my\nbrother: But I'll say now with the burial service, Ashes to ashes, and\ndirt to dirt!\n\nAy, said he, Lady Davers, and there we must all end at last; you with\nall your pride, and I with my plentiful fortune, must come to it; and\nthen where will be your distinction? Let me tell you, except you and I\nboth mend our manners, though you have been no duellist, no libertine,\nas you call me, this amiable girl, whom your vanity and folly so much\ndespise, will out-soar us both, infinitely out-soar us; and he who\njudges best, will give the preference where due, without regard to birth\nor fortune.\n\nEgregious preacher! said she: What, my brother already turned\nPuritan!--See what marriage and repentance may bring a man to! I\nheartily congratulate this change!--Well, said she, (and came towards\nme, and I trembled to see her coming; but her brother followed to\nobserve her, and I stood up at her approach, and she said,) give me thy\nhand, Mrs. Pamela, Mrs. Andrews, Mrs. what shall I call thee?--Thou hast\ndone wonders in a little time; thou hast not only made a rake a husband\nbut thou hast made a rake a preacher! But take care, added she, after\nall, in ironical anger, and tapped me on the neck, take care that thy\nvanity begins not where his ends; and that thou callest not thyself my\nsister.\n\nShe shall, I hope, Lady Davers, said he, when she can make as great a\nconvert of you from pride, as she has of me, from libertinism.\n\nMrs. Jewkes just then came up, and said dinner was ready. Come, my\nPamela, said my dear master; you desired to be excused from breakfasting\nwith us; but I hope you'll give Lady Davers and me your company to\ndinner.\n\nHow dare you insult me thus? said my lady.--How dare you, said he,\ninsult me by your conduct in my own house, after I have told you I am\nmarried? How dare you think of staying here one moment, and refuse my\nwife the honours that belong to her as such?\n\nMerciful God! said she, give me patience! and held her hand to her\nforehead.\n\nPray, sir, dear sir, said I, excuse me, don't vex my lady:--Be silent,\nmy dear love, said he; you see already what you have got by your sweet\ncondescension. You have thrown yourself at her feet, and, insolent\nas she is, she has threatened to trample upon you. She'll ask you,\npresently, if she is to owe her excuse to your interposition? and yet\nnothing else can make her forgiven.\n\nPoor lady, she could not bear this; and, as if she was discomposed, she\nran to her poor grieved woman, and took hold of her hand, and said,\nLead me down, lead me down, Beck! Let us instantly quit this house, this\ncursed house, that once I took pleasure in! Order the fellows to get\nready, and I will never see it, nor its owner, more. And away she went\ndown stairs, in a great hurry. And the servants were ordered to make\nready for their departure.\n\nI saw my master was troubled, and I went to him, and said, Pray, dear\nsir, follow my lady down, and pacify her. 'Tis her love to you.--Poor\nwoman! said he, I am concerned for her! But I insist upon your coming\ndown, since things are gone so far. Her pride will get new strength\nelse, and we shall be all to begin again.\n\nDearest, dear sir, said I, excuse my going down this once! Indeed, my\ndear, I won't, replied he. What! shall it be said, that my sister shall\nscare my wife from my table, and I present?--No, I have borne too much\nalready; and so have you: And I charge you come down when I send for\nyou.\n\nHe departed, saying these words, and I durst not dispute; for I saw he\nwas determined. And there is as much majesty as goodness in him, as I\nhave often had reason to observe; though never more than on the present\noccasion with his sister. Her ladyship instantly put on her hood and\ngloves, and her woman tied up a handkerchief full of things; for her\nprincipal matters were not unpacked; and her coachman got her chariot\nready, and her footmen their horses; and she appeared resolved to go.\nBut her kinsman and Mr. Colbrand had taken a turn together, somewhere;\nand she would not come in, but sat fretting on a seat in the fore-yard,\nwith her woman by her; and, at last, said to one of the footmen, Do you,\nJames, stay to attend my nephew; and we'll take the road we came.\n\nMrs. Jewkes went to her ladyship, and said, Your ladyship will be\npleased to stay dinner; 'tis just coming upon table? No, said she, I\nhave enough of this house; I have indeed. But give my service to your\nmaster, and I wish him happier than he has made me.\n\nHe had sent for me down, and I came, though unwillingly, and the cloth\nwas laid in the parlour I had jumped out of; and there was my master\nwalking about it. Mrs. Jewkes came in, and asked, if he pleased to\nhave dinner brought in? for my lady would not come in, but desired her\nservice, and wished him happier than he had made her. He, seeing her\nat the window, when he went to that side of the room, all ready to go,\nstept out to her, and said, Lady Davers, if I thought you would not be\nhardened, rather than softened, by my civility, I would ask you to walk\nin; and, at least, let your kinsman and servants dine before they go.\nShe wept, and turned her face from him, to hide it. He took her hand,\nand said, Come, sister, let me prevail upon you: Walk in. No, said she,\ndon't ask me.--I wish I could hate you, as much as you hate me!--You do,\nsaid he, and a great deal more, I'll assure you; or else you'd not vex\nme as you do.--Come, pray walk in. Don't ask me, said she. Her kinsman\njust then returned: Why, madam, said he, your ladyship won't go till you\nhave dined, I hope. No, Jackey, said she, I can't stay; I'm an intruder\nhere, it seems!--Think, said my master, of the occasion you gave for\nthat word. Your violent passions are the only intruders! Lay them aside,\nand never sister was dearer to a brother. Don't say such another word,\nsaid she, I beseech you; for I am too easy to forgive you any thing for\none kind word!--You shall have one hundred, said he, nay, ten thousand,\nif they will do, my dear sister. And, kissing her, he added, Pray give\nme your hand. John, said he, put up the horses; you are all as welcome\nto me, for all your lady's angry with me, as at any inn you can put up\nat. Come, Mr. H----, said he, lead your aunt in; for she won't permit\nthat honour to me.\n\nThis quite overcame her; and she said, giving her brother her hand,\nYes, I will, and you shall lead me any where! and kissed him. But don't\nthink, said she, I can forgive you neither. And so he led her into the\nparlour where I was. But, said she, why do you lead me to this wench?\n'Tis my wife, my dear sister; and if you will not love her, yet don't\nforget common civilities to her, for your own sake.\n\nPray, madam, said her kinsman, since your brother is pleased to own his\nmarriage, we must not forget common civilities, as Mr. B---- says. And,\nsir, added he, permit me to wish you joy. Thank you, sir, said he.\nAnd may I? said he, looking at me. Yes, sir, replied my master. So he\nsaluted me, very complaisantly; and said, I vow to Gad, madam, I did not\nknow this yesterday; and if I was guilty of a fault, I beg your pardon.\n\nMy lady said, Thou'rt a good-natured foolish fellow; thou might'st have\nsaved this nonsensical parade, till I had given thee leave. Why, aunt,\nsaid he, if they are actually married, there's no help for it; and we\nmust not make mischief between man and wife.\n\nBut brother, said she, do you think I'll sit at table with the creature?\nNo contemptuous names, I beseech you, Lady Davers! I tell you she is\nreally my wife; and I must be a villain to suffer her to be ill used.\nShe has no protector but me; and, if you will permit her, she will\nalways love and honour you.--Indeed, indeed I will, madam, said I.\n\nI cannot, I won't sit down at table with her, said she: Pamela, I hope\nthou dost not think I will?--Indeed, madam, said I, if your good brother\nwill permit it, I will attend your chair all the time you dine, to shew\nmy veneration for your ladyship, as the sister of my kind protector.\nSee, said he, her condition has not altered her; but I cannot permit in\nher a conduct unworthy of my wife; and I hope my sister will not expect\nit neither.\n\nLet her leave the room, replied she, if I must stay. Indeed you are out\nof the way, aunt, said her kinsman; that is not right, as things stand.\nSaid my master, No, madam, that must not be; but, if it must be so,\nwe'll have two tables; you and your nephew shall sit at one, and my\nwife and I at the other: and then see what a figure your unreasonable\npunctilio will make you cut.--She seemed irresolute, and he placed her\nat the table; the first course, which was fish, being brought in. Where,\nsaid she to me, would'st thou presume to sit? Would'st have me give\nplace to thee too, wench?--Come, come, said my master, I'll put that out\nof dispute; and so set himself down by her ladyship, at the upper end of\nthe table, and placed me at his left hand. Excuse me, my dear, said he;\nthis once excuse me!--Oh! your cursed complaisance, said she, to such\na----. Hush, sister! hush! said he: I will not bear to hear her spoken\nslightly of! 'Tis enough, that, to oblige your violent and indecent\ncaprice, you make me compromise with you thus.\n\nCome, sir, added he, pray take your place next your gentle aunt!--Beck,\nsaid she, do you sit down by Pamela there, since it must be so; we'll\nbe hail fellow all! With all my heart, replied my master; I have so much\nhonour for all the sex, that I would not have the meanest person of it\nstand, while I sit, had I been to have made the custom. Mrs. Worden,\npray sit down. Sir, said she, I hope I shall know my place better.\n\nMy lady sat considering; and then, lifting up her hands, said, Lord!\nwhat will this world come to?--To nothing but what's very good, replied\nmy master, if such spirits as Lady Davers's do but take the rule of it.\nShall I help you, sister, to some of the carp? Help your beloved! said\nshe. That's kind! said he.--Now, that's my good Lady Davers! Here,\nmy love, let me help you, since my sister desires it.--Mighty well,\nreturned she, mighty well!--But sat on one side, turning from me, as it\nwere.\n\nDear aunt, said her kinsman, let's see you buss and be friends: since\n'tis so, what signifies it? Hold thy fool's tongue! said she: Is thy\ntone so soon turned since yesterday? said my master, I hope nothing\naffronting was offered yesterday to my wife, in her own house. She hit\nhim a good smart slap on the shoulder: Take that, impudent brother said\nshe. I'll wife you, and in her own house! She seemed half afraid: but\nhe, in very good humour, kissed her, and said, I thank you, sister, I\nthank you. But I have not had a blow from you before for some time!\n\n'Fore gad, said her kinsman, 'tis very kind of you to take it so well.\nHer ladyship is as good a woman as ever lived; but I've had many a cuff\nfrom her myself.\n\nI won't put it up neither, said my master, except you'll assure me you\nhave seen her serve her lord so.\n\nI pressed my foot to his, and said, softly, Don't, dear sir!--What! said\nshe, is the creature begging me off from insult? If his manners won't\nkeep him from outraging me, I won't owe his forebearance to thee, wench.\n\nSaid my master, and put some fish on my lady's plate, Well does Lady\nDavers use the word insult!--But, come, let me see you eat one mouthful,\nand I'll forgive you; and he put the knife in one of her hands, and the\nfork in the other. As I hope to live, said he, I cannot bear this silly\nchildishness, for nothing at all! I am quite ashamed of it.\n\nShe put a little bit to her mouth, but laid it down in her plate again:\nI cannot eat, said she; I cannot swallow, I'm sure. It will certainly\nchoak me. He had forbid his menservants to come in, that they might not\nbehold the scene he expected; and rose from table himself, and filled\na glass of wine, her woman offering, and her kinsman rising, to do it.\nMean-time, his seat between us being vacant, she turned to me: How now,\nconfidence, said she, darest thou sit next me? Why dost thou not rise,\nand take the glass from thy property?\n\nSit still, my dear, said he; I'll help you both. But I arose; for I was\nafraid of a good cuff; and said, Pray, sir, let me help my lady. So you\nshall, replied he, when she's in a humour to receive it as she ought.\nSister, said he, with a glass in his hand, pray drink; you'll perhaps\neat a little bit of something then. Is this to insult me? said she.--No,\nreally, returned he: but to incite you to eat; for you'll be sick for\nwant of it.\n\nShe took the glass, and said, God forgive you, wicked wretch, for your\nusage of me this day!--This is a little as it used to be!--I once had\nyour love;--and now it is changed; and for whom? that vexes me! And wept\nso, she was forced to set down the glass.\n\nYou don't do well, said he. You neither treat me like your brother nor\na gentleman; and if you would suffer me, I would love you as well as\never.--But for a woman of sense and understanding, and a fine-bred\nwoman, as I once thought my sister, you act quite a childish part. Come,\nadded he, and held the glass to her lips, let your brother, that you\nonce loved, prevail on you to drink this glass of wine.--She then drank\nit. He kissed her, and said, Oh! how passion deforms the noblest minds!\nYou have lost a good deal of that loveliness that used to adorn my\nsister. And let me persuade you to compose yourself, and be my sister\nagain!--For Lady Davers is, indeed, a fine woman; and has a presence as\nmajestic for a lady, as her dear brother has for a gentleman.\n\nHe then sat down between us again, and said, when the second course came\nin, Let Abraham come in and wait. I touched his toe again; but he minded\nit not; and I saw he was right; for her ladyship began to recollect\nherself, and did not behave half so ill before the servants, as she had\ndone; and helped herself with some little freedom; but she could not\nforbear a strong sigh and a sob now and then. She called for a glass\nof the same wine she had drank before. Said he, Shall I help you again,\nLady Davers?--and rose, at the same time, and went to the sideboard,\nand filled her a glass. Indeed, said she, I love to be soothed by my\nbrother!--Your health, sir!\n\nSaid my master to me, with great sweetness, My dear, now I'm up, I'll\nfill for you!--I must serve both sisters alike! She looked at the\nservant, as if he were a little check upon her, and said to my master,\nHow now, sir!--Not that you know of. He whispered her, Don't shew any\ncontempt before my servants to one I have so deservedly made their\nmistress. Consider, 'tis done.--Ay, said she, that's the thing that\nkills me.\n\nHe gave me a glass: My good lady's health, sir, said I.--That won't do,\nsaid she, leaning towards me, softly: and was going to say wench, or\ncreature, or some such word. And my master, seeing Abraham look towards\nher, her eyes being red and swelled, said, Indeed, sister, I would not\nvex myself about it, if I was you. About what? said she. Why, replied\nhe, about your lord's not coming down, as he had promised. He sat down,\nand she tapped him on the shoulder: Ah! wicked one, said she, nor will\nthat do neither!--Why, to be sure, added he, it would vex a lady of\nyour sense and merit to be slighted, if it was so; but I am sure my\nlord loves you, as well as you love him; and you know not what may have\nhappened.\n\nShe shook her head, and said, That's like your art!--This makes one\namazed you should be so caught!--Who, my lord caught! said he: No, no!\nhe'll have more wit than so! But I never heard you were jealous before.\nNor, said he, have you any reason to think so now!--Honest friend, you\nneed not wait, said she; my woman will help us to what we want. Yes, let\nhim, replied he. Abraham, fill me a glass. Come, said my master,\nLord Davers to you, madam: I hope he'll take care he is not found\nout!--You're very provoking, brother, said she. I wish you were as good\nas Lord Davers.--But don't carry your jest too far. Well, said he, 'tis\na tender point, I own. I've done.\n\nBy these kind managements the dinner passed over better than I expected.\nAnd when the servants were withdrawn, my master said, still keeping his\nplace between us, I have a question to ask you, Lady Davers, and that\nis, If you'll bear me company to Bedfordshire? I was intending to set\nout thither to-morrow, but I'll tarry your pleasure, if you'll go with\nme.\n\nIs thy wife, as thou callest her, to go along with thee, friend? said\nshe. Yes, to be sure, answered he, my dear Quaker sister; and took\nher hand, and smiled. And would'st have me parade it with her on the\nroad?--Hey?--And make one to grace her retinue?--Hey? Tell me how\nthoud'st chalk it out, if I would do as thou would'st have me, honest\nfriend?\n\nHe clasped his arms about her, and kissed her: You are a dear saucy\nsister, said he; but I must love you!--Why, I'll tell you how I'd have\nit. Here shall you, and my Pamela--Leave out my, I desire you, if you'd\nhave me sit patiently. No, replied he, I can't do that. Here shall you,\nand my Pamela, go together in your chariot, if you please; and she will\nthen appear as one of your retinue; and your nephew and I will sometimes\nride, and sometimes go into my chariot, to your woman.\n\nShould'st thou like this, creature? said she to me.--If your ladyship\nthink it not too great an honour for me, madam, said I. Yes, replied\nshe, but my ladyship does think it would be too great an honour.\n\nNow I think of it, said he, this must not be neither; for, without you'd\ngive her the hand in your own chariot, my wife would be thought your\nwoman, and that must not be. Why, that would, may be, said she, be the\nonly inducement for me to bear her near me, in my chariot.--But, how\nthen?--Why then, when we came home, we'd get Lord Davers to come to us,\nand stay a month or two.\n\nAnd what if he was to come?--Why I would have you, as I know you have\na good fancy, give Pamela your judgment on some patterns I expect from\nLondon, for clothes.--Provoking wretch! said she; now I wish I may keep\nmy hands to myself. I don't say it to provoke you, said he, nor ought it\nto do so. But when I tell you I am married, is it not a consequence that\nwe must have new clothes?\n\nHast thou any more of these obliging things to say to me, friend? said\nshe. I will make you a present, returned he, worth your acceptance,\nif you will grace us with your company at church, when we make our\nappearance.--Take that, said she, if I die for it, wretch that thou art!\nand was going to hit him a great slap; but he held her hand. Her kinsman\nsaid, Dear aunt, I wonder at you! Why, all these are things of course.\n\nI begged leave to withdraw; and, as I went out, my good master said,\nThere's a person! There's a shape! There's a sweetness! O, Lady Davers!\nwere you a man, you would doat on her, as I do. Yes, said the naughty\nlady, so I should, for my harlot, but not for my wife. I turned, on\nthis, and said, Indeed your ladyship is cruel; and well may gentlemen\ntake liberties, when ladies of honour say such things! And I wept, and\nadded, Your ladyship's inference, if your good brother was not the most\ngenerous of men, would make me very unhappy.\n\nNo fear, wench; no fear, said she; thou'lt hold him as long as any body\ncan, I see that!--Poor Sally Godfrey never had half the interest in him,\nI'll assure you.\n\nStay, my Pamela, said he, in a passion; stay, when I bid you. You\nhave now heard two vile charges upon me!--I love you with such a true\naffection, that I ought to say something before this malicious accuser,\nthat you may not think your consummate virtue linked to so black a\nvillain.\n\nHer nephew seemed uneasy, and blamed her much; and I came back, but\ntrembled as I stood; and he set me down, and said, taking my hand, I\nhave been accused, my dear, as a dueller, and now as a profligate, in\nanother sense; and there was a time I should not have received these\nimputations with so much concern as I now do, when I would wish, by\ndegrees, by a conformity of my manners to your virtue, to shew every one\nthe force your example has upon me. But this briefly is the case of the\nfirst.\n\nI had a friend, who had been basely attempted to be assassinated by\nbravoes, hired by a man of title in Italy, who, like many other persons\nof title, had no honour; and, at Padua, I had the fortune to disarm\none of these bravoes in my friend's defence, and made him confess his\nemployer; and him, I own, I challenged. At Sienna we met, and he died\nin a month after, of a fever; but, I hope, not occasioned by the slight\nwounds he had received from me; though I was obliged to leave Italy\nupon it, sooner than I intended, because of his numerous relations, who\nlooked upon me as the cause of his death; though I pacified them by a\nletter I wrote them from Inspruck, acquainting them with the baseness of\nthe deceased: and they followed me not to Munich, as they intended.\n\nThis is one of the good-natured hints that might shock your sweetness,\non reflecting that you are yoked with a murderer. The other--Nay,\nbrother, said she, say no more. 'Tis your own fault if you go further.\nShe shall know it all, said he; and I defy the utmost stretch of your\nmalice.\n\nWhen I was at college, I was well received by a widow lady, who had\nseveral daughters, and but small fortunes to give them; and the old\nlady set one of them (a deserving good girl she was,) to draw me into\nmarriage with her, for the sake of the fortune I was heir to; and\ncontrived many opportunities to bring us and leave us together. I was\nnot then of age; and the young lady, not half so artful as her mother,\nyielded to my addresses before the mother's plot could be ripened, and\nso utterly disappointed it. This, my Pamela, is the Sally Godfrey, this\nmalicious woman, with the worst intentions, has informed you of. And\nwhatever other liberties I may have taken, (for perhaps some more I\nhave, which, had she known, you had heard of, as well as this,) I desire\nHeaven will only forgive me, till I revive its vengeance by the like\noffences, in injury to my Pamela.\n\nAnd now, my dear, you may withdraw; for this worthy sister of mine has\nsaid all the bad she knows of me; and what, at a proper opportunity,\nwhen I could have convinced you, that they were not my boast, but my\nconcern, I should have acquainted you with myself; for I am not fond of\nbeing thought better than I am: though I hope, from the hour I devoted\nmyself to so much virtue, to that of my death, my conduct shall be\nirreproachable.\n\nShe was greatly moved at this, and the noble manner in which the dear\ngentleman owned and repented of his faults; and gushed out into tears,\nand said, No, don't yet go, Pamela, I beseech you. My passion has\ncarried me too far, a great deal; and, coming to me, she shook my hand,\nand said, You must stay to hear me beg his pardon; and so took his\nhand.--But, to my concern, (for I was grieved for her ladyship's grief,)\nhe burst from her; and went out of the parlour into the garden in a\nviolent rage, that made me tremble. Her ladyship sat down, and leaned\nher head against my bosom, and made my neck wet with her tears, holding\nme by the hands; and I wept for company.--Her kinsman walked up and down\nthe parlour in a sad fret; and going out afterwards, he came in, and\nsaid, Mr. B---- has ordered his chariot to be got ready, and won't be\nspoken to by any body. Where is he? said she.--Walking in the garden\ntill it is ready, replied he.\n\nWell, said she, I have indeed gone too far. I was bewitched! And\nnow, said she, malicious as he calls me, will he not forgive me for a\ntwelvemonth: for I tell you, Pamela, if ever you offend, he will not\neasily forgive. I was all delighted, though sad, to see her ladyship so\ngood to me. Will you venture, said she, to accompany me to him?--Dare\nyou follow a lion in his retreats?--I'll attend your ladyship, said I,\nwherever you command. Well, wench, said she; Pamela, I mean; thou art\nvery good in the main!--I should have loved thee as well as my mother\ndid--if--but 'tis all over now! Indeed you should not have married my\nbrother! But come, I must love him! Let's find him out! And yet will\nhe use me worse than a dog!--I should not, added she, have so much\nexasperated him: for, whenever I have, I have always had the worst of\nit. He knows I love him!\n\nIn this manner her ladyship talked to me, leaning on my arm, and walking\ninto the garden. I saw he was still in a tumult, as it were; and he\ntook another walk to avoid us. She called after him, and said, Brother,\nbrother, let me speak to you!--One word with you! And as we made haste\ntowards him, and came near to him; I desire, said he, that you'll not\noppress me more with your follies, and your violence. I have borne too\nmuch with you, and I will vow for a twelvemonth, from this day--Hush,\nsaid she, don't vow, I beg you for too well will you keep it, I know by\nexperience, if you do. You see, said she, I stoop to ask Pamela to be my\nadvocate. Sure that will pacify you!\n\nIndeed, said he, I desire to see neither of you, on such an occasion;\nand let me only be left to myself, for I will not be intruded upon thus;\nand was going away.--But, said she, One word first, I desire.--If you'll\nforgive me, I'll forgive you.--What, said the dear man, haughtily, will\nyou forgive me?--Why, said she, for she saw him too angry to mention his\nmarriage, as a subject that required her pardon--I will forgive you all\nyour bad usage of me this day.\n\nI will be serious with you, sister, said he: I wish you most sincerely\nwell; but let us, from this time, study so much one another's quiet,\nas never to come near one another more. Never? said she.--And can you\ndesire this? barbarous brother! can you?--I can, I do, said he; and I\nhave nothing to do, but to hide from you, not a brother, but a murderer,\nand a profligate, unworthy of your relation; and let me be consigned\nto penitence for my past evils: A penitence, however, that shall not be\nbroken in upon by so violent an accuser.\n\nPamela, said he, and made me tremble, How dare you approach me, without\nleave, when you see me thus disturbed?--Never, for the future, come near\nme, when I am in these tumults, unless I send for you.\n\nDear sir! said I--Leave me, interrupted he. I will set out for\nBedfordshire this moment! What! sir, said I, without me?--What have I\ndone? You have too meanly, said he, for my wife, stooped to this furious\nsister of mine; and, till I can recollect, I am not pleased with you:\nBut Colbrand shall attend you, and two other of my servants; and Mrs.\nJewkes shall wait upon you part of the way: And I hope you'll find me in\na better disposition to receive you there, than I am at parting with you\nhere.\n\nHad I not hoped, that this was partly put on to intimidate my lady, I\nbelieve I could not have borne it: But it was grievous to me; for I saw\nhe was most sincerely in a passion.\n\nI was afraid, said she, he would be angry at you, as well as me; for\nwell do I know his unreasonable violence, when he is moved. But one\nword, sir, said she; Pardon Pamela, if you won't me; for she has\ncommitted no offence, but that of good-nature to me, and at my request.\nI will be gone myself, directly as I was about to do, had you not\nprevented me.\n\nI prevented you, said he, through love; but you have strung me for\nit, through hatred. But as for my Pamela, I know, besides the present\nmoment, I cannot be angry with her; and therefore I desire her never to\nsee me, on such occasions, till I can see her in the temper I ought to\nbe in, when so much sweetness approaches me. 'Tis therefore I say, my\ndearest, leave me now.\n\nBut, sir, said I, must I leave you, and let you go to Bedfordshire\nwithout me? Oh, dear sir, how can I?--Said my lady, You may go\nto-morrow, both of you, as you had designed; and I will go away this\nafternoon: And, since I cannot be forgiven, will try to forget I have a\nbrother.\n\nMay I, sir, said I, beg all your anger on myself, and to be reconciled\nto your good sister? Presuming Pamela! replied he, and made me start;\nArt thou then so hardy, so well able to sustain a displeasure, which\nof all things, I expected from thy affection, and thy tenderness, thou\nwould'st have wished to avoid?--Now, said he, and took my hand, and, as\nit were, tossed it from him, begone from my presence, and reflect upon\nwhat you have said to me!\n\nI was so frightened, (for then I saw he took amiss what I said,) that I\ntook hold of his knees, as he was turning from me; and I said, Forgive\nme, good sir! you see I am not so hardy! I cannot bear your displeasure!\nAnd was ready to sink.\n\nHis sister said, Only forgive Pamela; 'tis all I ask--You'll break\nher spirit quite!--You'll carry your passion as much too far as I have\ndone!--I need not say, said he, how well I love her; but she must not\nintrude upon me at such times as these!--I had intended, as soon as I\ncould have quelled, by my reason, the tumults you had caused by your\nviolence, to have come in, and taken such a leave of you both, as might\nbecome a husband, and a brother: But she has, unbidden, broke in upon\nme, and must take the consequence of a passion, which, when raised, is\nas uncontrollable as your own.\n\nSaid she, Did I not love you so well, as sister never loved a brother, I\nshould not have given you all this trouble. And did I not, said he, love\nyou better than you are resolved to deserve, I should be indifferent to\nall you say. But this last instance, after the duelling story (which\nyou would not have mentioned, had you not known it is always matter\nof concern for me to think upon), of poor Sally Godfrey, is a piece of\nspite and meanness, that I can renounce you my blood for.\n\nWell, said she, I am convinced it was wrong. I am ashamed of it myself.\n'Twas poor, 'twas mean, 'twas unworthy of your sister: And 'tis for this\nreason I stoop to follow you, to beg your pardon, and even to procure\none for my advocate, who I thought had some interest in you, if I might\nhave believed your own professions to her; which now I shall begin to\nthink made purposely to insult me.\n\nI care not what you think!--After the meanness you have been guilty of,\nI can only look upon you with pity: For, indeed, you have fallen very\nlow with me.\n\n'Tis plain I have, said she. But I'll begone.--And so, brother, let me\ncall you for this once! God bless you! And Pamela, said her ladyship,\nGod bless you! and kissed me, and wept.\n\nI durst say no more: And my lady turning from him, he said, Your sex\nis the d---l! how strangely can you discompose, calm, and turn, as\nyou please, us poor weathercocks of men! Your last kind blessing to my\nPamela I cannot stand! Kiss but each other again. And then he took both\nour hands, and joined them; and my lady saluting me again, with tears on\nboth sides, he put his kind arms about each of our waists, and saluted\nus with great affection, saying, Now, God bless you both, the two\ndearest creatures I have in the world!\n\nWell, said she, you will quite forget my fault about Miss--He stopt her\nbefore she could speak the name, and said, For ever forget it!--And,\nPamela, I'll forgive you too, if you don't again make my displeasure so\nlight a thing to you, as you did just now.\n\nSaid my lady, She did not make your displeasure a light thing to her;\nbut the heavier it was, the higher compliment she made me, that she\nwould bear it all, rather than not see you and me reconciled. No matter\nfor that, said he: It was either an absence of thought, or a slight\nby implication, at least, that my niceness could not bear from her\ntenderness: For looked it not presuming, that she could stand my\ndispleasure, or was sure of making her terms when she pleased? Which,\nfond as I am of her, I assure her, will not be always, in wilful faults,\nin her power.\n\nNay, said my lady, I can tell you, Pamela, you have a gentleman here\nin my brother; and you may expect such treatment from him, as that\ncharacter, and his known good sense and breeding, will always oblige him\nto shew: But if you offend, the Lord have mercy upon you!--You see how\nit is by poor me!--And yet I never knew him to forgive so soon.\n\nI am sure, said I, I will take care as much as I can; for I have been\nfrightened out of my wits, and had offended, before I knew where I was.\n\nSo happily did this storm blow over; and my lady was quite subdued and\npacified.\n\nWhen we came out of the garden, his chariot was ready; and he said,\nWell, sister, I had most assuredly gone away towards my other house, if\nthings had not taken this happy turn; and, if you please, instead of\nit, you and I will take an airing: And pray, my dear, said he to me, bid\nMrs. Jewkes order supper by eight o'clock, and we shall then join you.\n\nSir, added he, to her nephew, will you take your horse and escort us? I\nwill, said he: and am glad, at my soul, to see you all so good friends.\n\nSo my dear lord and master handed my lady into his chariot, and her\nkinsman and his servants rode after them and I went up to my closet to\nruminate on these things. And, foolish thing that I am, this poor Miss\nSally Godfrey runs into my head!--How soon the name and quality of a\nwife gives one privileges, in one's own account!--Yet, methinks, I want\nto know more about her; for, is it not strange, that I, who lived\nyears in the family, should have heard nothing of this? But I was so\nconstantly with my lady, that I might the less hear of it; for she, I\ndare say, never knew it, or she would have told me.\n\nBut I dare not ask him about the poor lady.--Yet I wonder what became of\nher! Whether she be living? And whether any thing came of it?--May be I\nshall hear full soon enough!--But I hope not to any bad purpose.\n\nAs to the other unhappy case, I know it was talked of, that in his\ntravels, before I was taken into the family long, he had one or two\nbroils; and, from a youth, he was always remarkable for courage, and is\nreckoned a great master of his sword. God grant he may never be put to\nuse it! and that he may be always preserved in honour and safety!\n\nAbout seven o'clock my master sent word, that he would have me not\nexpect him to supper; for that he, and my lady his sister, and nephew,\nwere prevailed upon to stay with Lady Jones; and that Lady Darnford, and\nMr. Peters's family, had promised to meet them there. I was glad they\ndid not send for me; and the rather, as I hoped those good families\nbeing my friends, would confirm my lady a little in my favour; and so I\nfollowed my writing closely.\n\nAbout eleven o'clock they returned. I had but just come down, having\ntired myself with my pen, and was sitting talking with Mrs. Jewkes and\nMrs. Worden, whom I would, though unwillingly on their sides, make sit\ndown, which they did over against me. Mrs. Worden asked my pardon, in a\ngood deal of confusion, for the part she had acted against me; saying,\nThat things had been very differently represented to her; and that she\nlittle thought I was married, and that she was behaving so rudely to the\nlady of the house.\n\nI said, I took nothing amiss; and very freely forgave her; and hoped my\nnew condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every\none; but that I must endeavour to act not unworthy of it, for the honour\nof the gentleman who had so generously raised me to it.\n\nMrs. Jewkes said, that my situation gave me great opportunities of\nshewing the excellence of my nature, that I could forgive offences\nagainst me so readily, as she, for her own part, must always, she said,\nacknowledge, with confusion of face.\n\nPeople, said I, Mrs. Jewkes, don't know how they shall act, when their\nwills are in the power of their superiors; and I always thought one\nshould distinguish between acts of malice, and of implicit obedience;\nthough, at the same time, a person should know how to judge between\nlawful and unlawful. And even the great, though at present angry they\nare not obeyed, will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for\nwithstanding them in their unlawful commands.\n\nMrs. Jewkes seemed a little concerned at this; and I said, I spoke\nchiefly from my own experience: For that I might say, as they both knew\nmy story, that I had not wanted both for menaces and temptations; and\nhad I complied with the one, or been intimidated by the other, I should\nnot have been what I was.\n\nAh, madam! replied Mrs. Jewkes, I never knew any body like you; and I\nthink your temper sweeter, since the happy day, than before; and that,\nif possible, you take less upon you.\n\nWhy, a good reason, said I, may be assigned for that: I thought myself\nin danger: I looked upon every one as my enemy; and it was impossible\nthat I should not be fretful, uneasy, jealous. But when my dearest\nfriend had taken from me the ground of my uneasiness, and made me quite\nhappy, I should have been very blamable, if I had not shewn a satisfied\nand easy mind, and a temper that should engage every one's respect and\nlove at the same time, if possible: And so much the more, as it was\nbut justifying, in some sort, the honour I had received: For the fewer\nenemies I made myself, the more I engaged every one to think, that my\ngood benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done.\n\nThis way of talking pleased them both very much; and they made me many\ncompliments upon it, and wished me always to be happy, as, they said, I\nso well deserved.\n\nWe were thus engaged, when my master, and his sister and her nephew,\ncame in: and they made me quite alive, in the happy humour in which they\nall returned. The two women would have withdrawn: but my master said,\nDon't go, Mrs. Worden: Mrs. Jewkes, pray stay; I shall speak to you\npresently. So he came to me, and, saluting me, said, Well, my dear love,\nI hope I have not trespassed upon your patience, by an absence longer\nthan we designed. But it has not been to your disadvantage; for though\nwe had not your company, we have talked of nobody else but you.\n\nMy lady came up to me, and said, Ay, child, you have been all our\nsubject. I don't know how it is: but you have made two or three good\nfamilies, in this neighbourhood, as much your admirers, as your friend\nhere.\n\nMy sister, said he, has been hearing your praises, Pamela, from half\na score mouths, with more pleasure than her heart will easily let her\nexpress.\n\nMy good Lady Davers's favour, said I, and the continuance of yours,\nsir, would give me more pride than that of all the rest of the world put\ntogether.\n\nWell, child, said she, proud hearts don't come down all at once; though\nmy brother, here, has this day set mine a good many pegs lower than I\never knew it: But I will say, I wish you joy with my brother; and so\nkissed me.\n\nMy dear lady, said I, you for ever oblige me!--I shall now believe\nmyself quite happy. This was all I wanted to make me so!--And I hope I\nshall always, through my life, shew your ladyship, that I have the most\ngrateful and respectful sense of your goodness.\n\nBut, child, said she, I shall not give you my company when you make your\nappearance. Let your own merit make all your Bedfordshire neighbours\nyour friends, as it has done here, by your Lincolnshire ones; and you'll\nhave no need of my countenance, nor any body's else.\n\nNow, said her nephew, 'tis my turn: I wish you joy with all my soul,\nmadam; and, by what I have seen, and by what I have heard, 'fore Gad, I\nthink you have met with no more than you deserve; and so all the company\nsays, where we have been: And pray forgive all my nonsense to you.\n\nSir, said I, I shall always, I hope, respect as I ought, so near a\nrelation of my good Lord and Lady Davers; and I thank you for your kind\ncompliment.\n\nGad, Beck, said he, I believe you've some forgiveness too to ask; for we\nwere all to blame, to make madam, here, fly the pit, as she did. Little\ndid we think we made her quit her own house.\n\nThou always, said my lady, sayest too much, or too little.\n\nMrs. Worden said, I have been treated with so much goodness and\ncondescension since you went, that I have been beforehand, sir, in\nasking pardon myself.\n\nSo my lady sat down with me half an hour, and told me, that her brother\nhad carried her a fine airing, and had quite charmed her with his kind\ntreatment of her; and had much confirmed her in the good opinion she had\nbegun to entertain of my discreet and obliging behaviour: But, continued\nshe, when he would make me visit, without intending to stay, my old\nneighbours, (for, said she, Lady Jones being nearest, we visited her\nfirst; and she scraped all the rest of the company together,) they were\nall so full of your praises, that I was quite borne down; and, truly, it\nwas Saul among the prophets!\n\nYou may believe how much I was delighted with this; and I spared not my\ndue acknowledgments.\n\nWhen her ladyship took leave, to go to bed, she said, Goodnight to you,\nheartily, and to your good man. I kissed you when I came in, out of\nform; but I now kiss you out of more than form, I'll assure you.\n\nJoin with me, my dear parents, in my joy for this happy turn; the\ncontrary of which I so much dreaded, and was the only difficulty I had\nto labour with. This poor Miss Sally Godfrey, I wonder what's become\nof her, poor soul! I wish he would, of his own head, mention her\nagain.--Not that I am very uneasy, neither.--You'll say, I must be a\nlittle saucy, if I was.\n\nMy dear master gave me an account, when we went up, of the pains he had\ntaken with his beloved sister, as he himself styled her; and of all\nthe kind things the good families had said in my behalf; and that he\nobserved she was not so much displeased with hearing them, as she was\nat first; when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his wife:\nAnd that my health, as his spouse, being put; when it came to her, she\ndrank it; but said, Come, brother, here's your Pamela to you: But I\nshall not know how to stand this affair, when the Countess----, and the\nyoung ladies, come to visit me. One of these young ladies was the person\nshe was so fond of promoting a match for, with her brother.--Lady Betty,\nI know, she said, will rally me smartly upon it; and you know, brother,\nshe wants neither wit nor satire. He said, I hope, Lady Betty, whenever\nshe marries, will meet with a better husband than I should have\nmade her; for, in my conscience, I think I should hardly have made a\ntolerable one to any but Pamela.\n\nHe told me that they rallied him on the stateliness of his temper; and\nsaid, They saw he would make an exceeding good husband where he was;\nbut it must be owing to my meekness, more than to his complaisance; for,\nsaid Miss Darnford, I could see well enough, when your ladyship detained\nher, though he had but hinted his desire of finding her at our house,\nhe was so out of humour at her supposed noncompliance, that mine and my\nsister's pity for her was much more engaged, than our envy.\n\nAy, said my lady, he is too lordly a creature, by much; and can't bear\ndisappointment, nor ever could.\n\nSaid he, Well, Lady Davers, you should not, of all persons, find fault\nwith me; for I bore a great deal from you, before I was at all angry.\n\nYes, replied she: but when I had gone a little too far, as I own I did,\nyou made me pay for it severely enough! You know you did, sauce-box. And\nthe poor thing too, added she, that I took with me for my advocate, so\nlow had he brought me! he treated her in such a manner as made my heart\nache for her: But part was art, I know, to make me think the better of\nher.\n\nIndeed, sister, said he, there was very little of that; for, at that\ntime, I cared not what you thought, nor had complaisance enough to have\ngiven a shilling for your good or bad opinion of her or me. And, I\nown, I was displeased to be broken in upon, after your provocations,\nby either of you and she must learn that lesson, never to come near me,\nwhen I am in those humours; which shall be as little as possible: For,\nafter a while, if let alone, I always come to myself, and am sorry for\nthe violence of a temper, so like my dear sister's here: And, for\nthis reason think it is no matter how few witnesses I have of its\nintemperance, while it lasts; especially since every witness, whether\nthey merit it or not, as you see in my Pamela's case, must be a sufferer\nby it, if, unsent for, they come in my way.\n\nHe repeated the same lesson to me again, and enforced it and owned, that\nhe was angry with me in earnest, just then; though more with himself,\nafterwards, for being so: But when, Pamela, said he, you wanted to\ntransfer all my displeasure upon yourself, it was so much braving me\nwith your merit, as if I must soon end my anger, if placed there; or\nit was making it so light to you, that I was truly displeased: for,\ncontinued he, I cannot bear that you should wish, on any occasion\nwhatever, to have me angry with you, or not to value my displeasure as\nthe heaviest misfortune that could befall you.\n\nBut, sir, said I, you know, that what I did was to try to reconcile my\nlady; and, as she herself observed, it was paying her a high regard. It\nwas so, replied he; but never think of making a compliment to her, or\nany body living, at my expense. Besides, she had behaved herself so\nintolerably, that I began to think you had stooped too much, and more\nthan I ought to permit my wife to do; and acts of meanness are what I\ncan't endure in any body, but especially where I love: and as she had\nbeen guilty of a very signal one, I had much rather have renounced her\nat that time, than have been reconciled to her.\n\nSir, said I, I hope I shall always comport myself so, as not wilfully\nto disoblige you for the future; and the rather do I hope this, as I\nam sure I shall want only to know your pleasure to obey it. But this\ninstance shews me, that I may much offend, without designing it in the\nleast.\n\nNow, Pamela, replied he, don't be too serious: I hope I shan't be a very\ntyrannical husband to you: Yet do I not pretend to be perfect, or to\nbe always governed by reason in my first transports; and I expect, from\nyour affection, that you will bear with me when you find me wrong. I\nhave no ungrateful spirit, and can, when cool, enter as impartially\ninto myself as most men; and then I am always kind and acknowledging, in\nproportion as I have been out of the way.\n\nBut to convince you, my dear, continued he, of your fault, (I mean, with\nregard to the impetuosity of my temper; for there was no fault in your\nintention, that I acknowledge,) I'll observe only, that you met, when\nyou came to me, while I was so out of humour, a reception you did not\nexpect, and a harsh word or two that you did not deserve. Now, had you\nnot broken in upon me while my anger lasted, but staid till I had come\nto you, or sent to desire your company, you'd have seen none of this;\nbut that affectionate behaviour, which I doubt not you'll always merit,\nand I shall always take pleasure in expressing: and in this temper shall\nyou always find a proper influence over me: But you must not suppose,\nwhenever I am out of humour, that, in opposing yourself to my passion,\nyou oppose a proper butt to it; but when you are so good, like the\nslender reed, to bend to the hurricane, rather than, like the sturdy\noak, to resist it, you will always stand firm in my kind opinion, while\na contrary conduct would uproot you, with all your excellencies, from my\nsoul.\n\nSir, said I, I will endeavour to conform myself, in all things, to your\nwill. I make no doubt but you will: and I'll endeavour to make my will\nas conformable to reason as I can. And let me tell you, that this belief\nof you is one of the inducements I have had to marry at all: for nobody\nwas more averse to this state than myself; and, now we are upon this\nsubject, I'll tell you why I was so averse.\n\nWe people of fortune, or such as are born to large expectations, of both\nsexes, are generally educated wrong. You have occasionally touched upon\nthis, Pamela, several times in your journal, so justly, that I need say\nthe less to you. We are usually so headstrong, so violent in our wills,\nthat we very little bear control.\n\nHumoured by our nurses, through the faults of our parents, we practise\nfirst upon them; and shew the gratitude of our dispositions, in\nan insolence that ought rather to be checked and restrained, than\nencouraged.\n\nNext, we are to be indulged in every thing at school; and our masters\nand mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our\nboisterous behaviour.\n\nBut, in our wise parents' eyes, all looks well, all is forgiven and\nexcused; and for no other reason, but because we are theirs.\n\nOur next progression is, we exercise our spirits, when brought home,\nto the torment and regret of our parents themselves, and torture their\nhearts by our undutiful and perverse behaviour to them, which, however\nungrateful in us, is but the natural consequence of their culpable\nindulgence to us, from infancy upwards.\n\nAnd then, next, after we have, perhaps, half broken their hearts, a\nwife is looked out for: convenience, or birth, or fortune, are the first\nmotives, affection the last (if it is at all consulted): and two people\nthus educated, thus trained up, in a course of unnatural ingratitude,\nand who have been headstrong torments to every one who has had a share\nin their education, as well as to those to whom they owe their being,\nare brought together; and what can be expected, but that they should\npursue, and carry on, the same comfortable conduct in matrimony, and\njoin most heartily to plague one another? And, in some measure, indeed,\nthis is right; because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who\nhave been aggrieved and insulted by them, upon one another.\n\nThe gentleman has never been controlled: the lady has never been\ncontradicted.\n\nHe cannot bear it from one whose new relation, he thinks, should oblige\nher to shew a quite contrary conduct.\n\nShe thinks it very barbarous, now, for the first time, to be opposed\nin her will, and that by a man from whom she expected nothing but\ntenderness.\n\nSo great is the difference between what they both expect from one\nanother, and what they both find in each other, that no wonder\nmisunderstandings happen; that these ripen to quarrels; that acts of\nunkindness pass, which, even had the first motive to their union been\naffection, as usually it is not, would have effaced all manner of tender\nimpressions on both sides.\n\nAppeals to parents or guardians often ensue. If, by mediation of\nfriends, a reconciliation takes place, it hardly ever holds: for why?\nThe fault is in the minds of both, and neither of them will think so;\nso that the wound (not permitted to be probed) is but skinned over, and\nrankles still at the bottom, and at last breaks out with more pain and\nanguish than before. Separate beds are often the consequence; perhaps\nelopements: if not, an unconquerable indifference, possibly aversion.\nAnd whenever, for appearance-sake, they are obliged to be together,\nevery one sees, that the yawning husband, and the vapourish wife, are\ntruly insupportable to one another; but separate, have freer spirits,\nand can be tolerable company.\n\nNow, my dear, I would have you think, and I hope you will have no other\nreason, that had I married the first lady in the land, I would not have\ntreated her better than I will my Pamela. For my wife is my wife; and I\nwas the longer in resolving on the state, because I knew its requisites,\nand doubted my conduct in it.\n\nI believe I am more nice than many gentlemen; but it is because I have\nbeen a close observer of the behaviour of wedded folks, and hardly\never have seen it to be such as I could like in my own case. I shall,\npossibly, give you instances of a more particular nature of this, as we\nare longer, and, perhaps, I might say, better acquainted.\n\nHad I married with the views of many gentlemen, and with such as my\ngood sister (supplying the place of my father and mother,) would have\nrecommended, I had wedded a fine lady, brought up pretty much in my own\nmanner, and used to have her will in every thing.\n\nSome gentlemen can come into a compromise; and, after a few struggles,\nsit down tolerably contented. But, had I married a princess, I could\nnot have done so. I must have loved her exceedingly well, before I had\nconsented to knit the knot with her, and preferred her to all her sex;\nfor without this, Pamela, indifferences, if not disgusts, will arise in\nevery wedded life, that could not have made me happy at home; and there\nare fewer instances, I believe, of men's loving better, after matrimony,\nthan of women's; the reason of which 'tis not my present purpose to\naccount for.\n\nThen I must have been morally sure, that she preferred me to all men;\nand, to convince me of this, she must have lessened, not aggravated,\nmy failings: She must have borne with my imperfections; she must have\nwatched and studied my temper; and if ever she had any points to\ncarry, any desire of overcoming, it must have been by sweetness and\ncomplaisance; and yet not such a slavish one, as should make her\ncondescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility, than\njudgment or affection.\n\nShe should not have given cause for any part of my conduct to her to\nwear the least aspect of compulsion or force. The word command, on my\nside, or obedience on hers, I would have blotted from my vocabulary. For\nthis reason I should have thought it my duty to have desired nothing of\nher, that was not significant, reasonable, or just; and that then she\nshould, on hers, have shewn no reluctance, uneasiness, or doubt, to\noblige me, even at half a word.\n\nI would not have excused her to let me twice enjoin the same thing,\nwhile I took so much care to make her compliance with me reasonable, and\nsuch as should not destroy her own free agency, in points that ought to\nbe allowed her: And if I was not always right, that yet she would bear\nwith me, if she saw me set upon it; and expostulate with me on the right\nside of compliance; for that would shew me, (supposing small points\nin dispute, from which the greatest quarrels, among friends, generally\narise,) that she differed from me, not for contradiction-sake, but\ndesired to convince me for my own; and that I should, another time, take\nbetter resolutions.\n\nThis would be so obliging a conduct, that I should, in justice, have\ndoubled my esteem for one, who, to humour me, could give up her\nown judgment; and I should see she could have no other view in her\nexpostulations, after her compliance had passed, than to rectify my\nmotions for the future; and it would have been impossible then, but I\nmust have paid the greater deference to her opinion and advice in more\nmomentous matters.\n\nIn all companies she must have shewn, that she had, whether I deserved\nit altogether or not, a high regard and opinion of me; and this the\nrather, as such a conduct in her would be a reputation and security\nto herself: For if we rakes attempt a married lady, our first\nencouragement, exclusive of our own vanity, arises from the indifferent\nopinion, slight, or contempt, she expresses of her husband.\n\nI should expect, therefore, that she should draw a kind veil over my\nfaults; that such as she could not hide, she would extenuate; that she\nwould place my better actions in an advantageous light, and shew that I\nhad her good opinion, at least, whatever liberties the world took with\nmy character.\n\nShe must have valued my friends for my sake; been cheerful and easy,\nwhomsoever I had brought home with me; and, whatever faults she had\nobserved in me, have never blamed me before company; at least, with such\nan air of superiority, as should have shewn she had a better opinion of\nher own judgment, than of mine.\n\nNow, my Pamela, this is but a faint sketch of the conduct I must have\nexpected from my wife, let her quality have been what it would; or have\nlived with her on bad terms. Judge then, if to me a lady of the modish\ntaste could have been tolerable.\n\nThe perverseness and contradiction I have too often seen, in some of my\nvisits, even among people of sense, as well as condition, had prejudiced\nme to the married state; and, as I knew I could not bear it, surely I\nwas in the right to decline it: And you see, my dear, that I have not\ngone among this class of people for a wife; nor know I, indeed, where,\nin any class, I could have sought one, or had one suitable to my mind,\nif not you: For here is my misfortune; I could not have been contented\nto have been but moderately happy in a wife.\n\nJudge you, from all this, if I could very well bear that you should\nthink yourself so well secured of my affection, that you could take the\nfaults of others upon yourself; and, by a supposed supererogatory merit,\nthink your interposition sufficient to atone for the faults of others.\n\nYet am I not perfect myself: No, I am greatly imperfect. Yet will I not\nallow, that my imperfections shall excuse those of my wife, or make her\nthink I ought to bear faults in her, that she can rectify, because she\nbears greater from me.\n\nUpon the whole, I may expect, that you will bear with me, and study my\ntemper, till, and only till, you see I am capable of returning insult\nfor obligation; and till you think, that I shall be of a gentler\ndeportment, if I am roughly used, than otherwise. One thing more I will\nadd, That I should scorn myself, if there was one privilege of your\nsex, that a princess might expect, as my wife, to be indulged in, that\nI would not allow to my Pamela; for you are the wife of my affections: I\nnever wished for one before you, nor ever do I hope to have another.\n\nI hope, sir, said I, my future conduct--Pardon me, said he, my dear, for\ninterrupting you; but it is to assure you, that I am so well convinced\nof your affectionate regard for me, that I know I might have spared the\ngreatest part of what I have said: And, indeed, it must be very bad\nfor both of us, if I should have reason to think it necessary to say\nso much. But one thing has brought on another; and I have rather spoken\nwhat my niceness has made me observe in other families, than what I fear\nin my own. And, therefore, let me assure you, I am thoroughly satisfied\nwith your conduct hitherto. You shall have no occasion to repent it: And\nyou shall find, though greatly imperfect, and passionate, on particular\nprovocations, (which yet I will try to overcome,) that you have not\na brutal or ungenerous husband, who is capable of offering insult for\ncondescension, or returning evil for good.\n\nI thanked him for these kind rules, and generous assurances: and assured\nhim, that they had made so much impression on my mind, that these, and\nhis most agreeable injunctions before given me, and such as he should\nhereafter be pleased to give me, should be so many rules for my future\nbehaviour.\n\nAnd I am glad of the method I have taken of making a Journal of all that\npasses in these first stages of my happiness, because it will sink the\nimpression still deeper; and I shall have recourse to them for my better\nregulation, as often as I shall mistrust my memory.\n\nLet me see: What are the rules I am to observe from this awful lecture?\nWhy these:\n\n\n1. That I must not, when he is in great wrath with any body, break in\nupon him without his leave. Well, I'll remember it, I warrant. But yet I\nthink this rule is almost peculiar to himself.\n\n2. That I must think his displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall\nme. To be sure I shall.\n\n3. And so that I must not wish to incur it, to save any body else. I'll\nbe further if I do.\n\n4. That I must never make a compliment to any body at his expense.\n\n5. That I must not be guilty of any acts of wilful meanness. There is\na great deal meant in this; and I'll endeavour to observe it all. To be\nsure, the occasion on which he mentions this, explains it; that I must\nsay nothing, though in anger, that is spiteful or malicious; that is\ndisrespectful or undutiful, and such-like.\n\n6. That I must bear with him, even when I find him in the wrong. This is\na little hard, as the case may be!\n\nI wonder whether poor Miss Sally Godfrey be living or dead!\n\n7. That I must be as flexible as the reed in the fable, lest, by\nresisting the tempest, like the oak, I be torn up by the roots. Well,\nI'll do the best I can!--There is no great likelihood, I hope, that\nI should be too perverse; yet sure, the tempest will not lay me quite\nlevel with the ground, neither.\n\n8. That the education of young people of condition is generally wrong.\nMemorandum; That if any part of children's education fall to my lot, I\nnever indulge and humour them in things that they ought to be restrained\nin.\n\n9. That I accustom them to bear disappointments and control.\n\n10. That I suffer them not to be too much indulged in their infancy.\n\n11. Nor at school.\n\n12. Nor spoil them when they come home.\n\n13. For that children generally extend their perverseness from the nurse\nto the schoolmaster: from the schoolmaster to the parents:\n\n14. And, in their next step, as a proper punishment for all, make their\nownselves unhappy.\n\n15. That undutiful and perverse children make bad husbands and wives:\nAnd, collaterally, bad masters and mistresses.\n\n16. That, not being subject to be controlled early, they cannot, when\nmarried, bear one another.\n\n17. That the fault lying deep, and in the minds of each other, neither\nwill mend it.\n\n18. Whence follow misunderstandings, quarrels, appeals, ineffectual\nreconciliations, separations, elopements; or, at best, indifference;\nperhaps, aversion.--Memorandum; A good image of unhappy wedlock, in the\nwords YAWNING HUSBAND, and VAPOURISH WIFE, when together: But separate,\nboth quite alive.\n\n19. Few married persons behave as he likes. Let me ponder this with awe\nand improvement.\n\n20. Some gentlemen can compromise with their wives, for quietness sake;\nbut he can't. Indeed I believe that's true; I don't desire he should.\n\n21. That love before marriage is absolutely necessary.\n\n22. That there are fewer instances of men's than women's loving better\nafter marriage. But why so? I wish he had given his reasons for this! I\nfancy they would not have been to the advantage of his own sex.\n\n23. That a woman give her husband reason to think she prefers him before\nall men. Well, to be sure this should be so.\n\n24. That if she would overcome, it must be by sweetness and\ncomplaisance; that is, by yielding, he means, no doubt.\n\n25. Yet not such a slavish one neither, as should rather seem the effect\nof her insensibility, than judgment or affection.\n\n26. That the words COMMAND and OBEY shall be blotted out of the\nVocabulary. Very good!\n\n27. That a man should desire nothing of his wife, but what is\nsignificant, reasonable, just. To be sure, that is right.\n\n28. But then, that she must not shew reluctance, uneasiness, or doubt,\nto oblige him; and that too at half a word; and must not be bid twice to\ndo one thing. But may not there be some occasions, where this may be a\nlittle dispensed with? But he says afterwards, indeed,\n\n29. That this must be only while he took care to make her compliance\nreasonable, and consistent with her free agency, in points that ought to\nbe allowed her. Come, this is pretty well, considering.\n\n30. That if the husband be set upon a wrong thing, she must not dispute\nwith him, but do it and, expostulate afterwards. Good sirs! I don't know\nwhat to say to this! It looks a little hard, methinks! This would bear a\nsmart debate, I fancy, in a parliament of women. But then he says,\n\n31. Supposing they are only small points that are in dispute. Well, this\nmends it a little. For small points, I think, should not be stood upon.\n\n32. That the greatest quarrels among friends (and wives and husbands\nare, or should be, friends) arise from small matters. I believe this is\nvery true; for I had like to have had anger here, when I intended very\nwell.\n\n33. That a wife should not desire to convince her husband for\nCONTRADICTION sake, but for HIS OWN. As both will find their account in\nthis, if one does, I believe 'tis very just.\n\n34. That in all companies a wife must shew respect and love to her\nhusband.\n\n35. And this for the sake of her own reputation and security; for,\n\n36. That rakes cannot have a greater encouragement to attempt a married\nlady's virtue, than her slight opinion of her husband. To be sure this\nstands to reason, and is a fine lesson.\n\n37. That a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over her husband's\nfaults.\n\n38. That such as she could not conceal, she should extenuate.\n\n39. That his virtues she should place in an advantageous light\n\n40. And shew the world, that he had HER good opinion at least.\n\n41. That she must value his friends for his sake.\n\n42. That she must be cheerful and easy in her behaviour, to whomsoever\nhe brings home with him.\n\n43. That whatever faults she sees in him, she never blame him before\ncompany.\n\n44. At least, with such an air of superiority, as if she had a less\nopinion of his judgment than her own.\n\n45. That a man of nice observation cannot be contented to be only\nmoderately happy in a wife.\n\n46. That a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to\nherself; so as to take the faults of others upon her.\n\nIndeed, I think it is well if we can bear our own! This is of the same\nnature with the third; and touches upon me, on the present occasion, for\nthis wholesome lecture.\n\n47. That his imperfections must not be a plea for hers. To be sure, 'tis\nno matter how good the women are; but 'tis to be hoped men will allow a\nlittle. But, indeed, he says,\n\n48. That a husband, who expects all this, is to be incapable of\nreturning insult for obligation, or evil for good; and ought not to\nabridge her of any privilege of her sex.\n\n\nWell, my dear parents, I think this last rule crowns the rest, and makes\nthem all very tolerable; and a generous man, and a man of sense, cannot\nbe too much obliged. And, as I have this happiness, I shall be very\nunworthy, if I do not always so think, and so act.\n\nYet, after all, you'll see I have not the easiest task in the world. But\nI know my own intentions, that I shall not wilfully err; and so fear the\nless.\n\nNot one hint did he give, that I durst lay hold of, about poor Miss\nSally Godfrey. I wish my lady had not spoken of it: for it has given me\na curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me; especially so early in my\nnuptials, and in a case so long ago past. Yet he intimated too, to his\nsister, that he had had other faults, (of this sort, I suppose,) that\nhad not come to her knowledge!--But I make no doubt he has seen his\nerror, and will be very good for the future. I wish it, and pray it may\nbe so, for his own dear sake!\n\n\nWednesday, the seventh.\n\nWhen I arose in the morning, I went to wait on Lady Davers, seeing her\ndoor open; and she was in bed, but awake, and talking to her woman. I\nsaid, I hope I don't disturb your ladyship. Not at all, said she; I am\nglad to see you. How do you do? Well, added she, when do you set out for\nBedfordshire?--I said, I can't tell, madam; it was designed as to-day,\nbut I have heard no more of it.\n\nSit down, said she, on the bed-side.--I find, by the talk we had\nyesterday and last night, you have had but a poor time of it, Pamela, (I\nmust call you so yet, said she,) since you were brought to this house,\ntill within these few days. And Mrs. Jewkes too has given Beck such an\naccount, as makes me pity you.\n\nIndeed, madam, said I, if your ladyship knew all, you would pity me; for\nnever poor creature was so hard put to it. But I ought to forget it all\nnow, and be thankful.\n\nWhy, said she, as far as I can find, 'tis a mercy you are here now. I\nwas sadly moved with some part of your story and you have really made a\nnoble defence, and deserve the praises of all our sex.\n\nIt was God enabled me, madam, replied I. Why, said she, 'tis the more\nextraordinary, because I believe, if the truth was known, you loved the\nwretch not a little. While my trials lasted, madam, said I, I had not a\nthought of any thing, but to preserve my innocence, much less of love.\n\nBut, tell me truly, said she, did you not love him all the time? I had\nalways, madam, answered I, a great reverence for my master, and thought\nall his good actions doubly good and for his naughty ones, though I\nabhorred his attempts upon me, yet I could not hate him; and always\nwished him well; but I did not know that it was love. Indeed I had not\nthe presumption.\n\nSweet girl! said she; that's prettily said: But when he found he could\nnot gain his ends, and began to be sorry for your sufferings, and to\nadmire your virtue, and to profess honourable love to you, what did you\nthink?\n\nThink! Indeed, madam, I did not know what to think! could neither hope\nnor believe so great an honour would fall to my lot, and feared more\nfrom his kindness, for some time, than I had done from his unkindness:\nAnd, having had a private intimation, from a kind friend, of a sham\nmarriage, intended by means of a man who was to personate a minister, it\nkept my mind in too much suspense, to be greatly overjoyed at his kind\ndeclaration.\n\nSaid she, I think he did make two or three attempts upon you in\nBedfordshire? Yes, madam, said I; he was very naughty, to be sure.\n\nAnd here he proposed articles to you, I understand? Yes, madam, replied\nI; but I abhorred so much the thoughts of being a kept creature, that\nI rejected them with great boldness; and was resolved to die before I\nwould consent to them.\n\nHe afterwards attempted you, I think: Did he not? O yes, madam, said I,\na most sad attempt he made! and I had like to have been lost; for\nMrs. Jewkes was not so good as she should have been. And so I told\nher ladyship that sad affair, and how I fell into fits; and that they\nbelieving me dying, forbore.--Any attempts after this base one? she\nsaid.\n\nHe was not so good as he should have been, returned I, once in the\ngarden, afterwards; but I was so watchful, and so ready to take the\nalarm!\n\nBut, said she, did he not threaten you, at times, and put on his stern\nairs, every now and then?--Threaten, madam, replied I; yes, I had enough\nof that! I thought I should have died for fear several times.--How could\nyou bear that? said she: for he is a most daring and majestic mortal! He\nhas none of your puny hearts, but is as courageous as a lion; and, boy\nand man, never feared any thing. I myself, said she, have a pretty good\nspirit; but, when I have made him truly angry, I have always been forced\nto make it up with him, as well as I could: for, child, he is not one\nthat is easily reconciled, I assure you.\n\nBut, after he had professed honourable love to you, did he never attempt\nyou again?--No, indeed, madam, he did not. But he was a good while\nstruggling with himself, and with his pride, as he was pleased to call\nit, before he could stoop so low; and considered, and considered again:\nand once, upon my saying but two or three words, that displeased him,\nwhen he was very kind to me, he turned me out of doors, in a manner,\nat an hour's warning; for he sent me above a day's journey towards my\nfather's; and then sent a man and horse, post-haste, to fetch me back\nagain; and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since, and\nmade me happy.\n\nThat sending you away, said she, one hour, and sending after you the\nnext, is exactly like my brother; and 'tis well if he don't turn you off\ntwice or thrice before a year comes about, if you vex him: and he would\nhave done the same by the first lady in the land, if he had been\nmarried to her. Yet has he his virtues, as well as his faults; for he is\ngenerous; nay, he is noble in his spirit; hates little dirty actions: he\ndelights in doing good; but does not pass over a wilful fault easily. He\nis wise, prudent, sober, and magnanimous, and will not tell a lie,\nnor disguise his faults; but you must not expect to have him all to\nyourself, I doubt.\n\nBut I'll no more harp upon this string: You see how he was exasperated\nat me; and he seemed to be angry at you too; though something of it was\nart, I believe.\n\nIndeed, madam, said I, he has been pleased to give me a most noble\nlecture; and I find he was angry with me in earnest, and that it will\nnot be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him: for he is very\nnice and delicate in his notions, I perceive; but yet, as your ladyship\nsays, exceeding generous.\n\nWell, said she, I'm glad thou hadst a little bit of his anger; else I\nshould have thought it art; and I don't love to be treated with low art,\nany more than he; and I should have been vexed if he had done it by me.\n\nBut I understand, child, said she, that you keep a journal of all\nmatters that pass, and he has several times found means to get at it:\nShould you care I should see it? It could not be to your disadvantage;\nfor I find it had no small weight with him in your favour; and I should\ntake great pleasure to read all his stratagems, attempts, contrivances,\nmenaces, and offers to you, on one hand, and all your pretty\ncounter-plottings, which he much praises; your resolute resistance, and\nthe noble stand you have made to preserve your virtue; and the steps by\nwhich his pride was subdued, and his mind induced to honourable love,\ntill you were made what you now are: for it must be a rare and uncommon\nstory; and will not only give me great pleasure in reading, but will\nentirely reconcile me to the step he has taken: and that, let me tell\nyou, is what I never thought to be; for I had gone a great way in\nbringing about a match with him and Lady Betty--; and had said so much\nof it, that the earl, her father, approved of it: and so did the Duke of\n----, her uncle; and Lady Betty herself was not averse: and now I shall\nbe hunted to death about it; and this has made me so outrageous as you\nhave seen me upon the matter. But when I can find, by your writings,\nthat your virtue is but suitably rewarded, it will be not only a good\nexcuse for me, but for him, and make me love you. There is nothing that\nI would not do, said I, to oblige your ladyship; but my poor father and\nmother (who would rather have seen me buried quick in the earth, than\nto be seduced by the greatest of princes) have them in their hands at\npresent; and your dear brother has bespoken them, when they have done\nreading them: but, if he gives me leave, I will shew them to your\nladyship, with all my heart; not doubting your generous allowances, as\nI have had his; though I have treated him very freely all the way, while\nhe had naughty views; and that your ladyship would consider them as\nthe naked sentiments of my heart, from time to time delivered to those,\nwhose indulgence I was sure of; and for whose sight only they were\nwritten.\n\nGive me a kiss now, said her ladyship, for your cheerful compliance: for\nI make no doubt my brother will consent I shall see them, because they\nmust needs make for your honour; and I see he loves you better than any\none in the world.\n\nI have heard, continued her ladyship, a mighty good character of your\nparents, as industrious, honest, sensible, good folks, who know the\nworld; and, as I doubt not my brother's generosity, I am glad they will\nmake no ill figure in the world's eye.\n\nMadam, said I, they are the honestest, the lovingest, and the most\nconscientious couple breathing. They once lived creditably; and brought\nup a great family, of which I am the youngest; but had misfortunes,\nthrough their doing beyond their power for two unhappy brothers, who are\nboth dead, and whose debts they stood bound for; and so became reduced,\nand, by harsh creditors, (where most of the debts were, not of their own\ncontracting,) turned out of all; and having, without success, tried to\nset up a little country-school; (for my father understood a little of\naccounts, and wrote a pretty good hand;) forced to take to hard labour;\nbut honest all the time; contented; never repining; and loving to one\nanother; and, in the midst of their poverty and disappointments, above\nall temptation; and all their fear was, that I should be wicked, and\nyield to temptation for the sake of worldly riches and to God's grace,\nand their good lessons, and those I imbibed from my dear good lady,\nyour ladyship's mother, it is that I owe the preservation of my\ninnocence,--and the happy station I am exalted to.\n\nShe was pleased to kiss me again, and said, There is such a noble\nsimplicity in thy story, such an honest artlessness in thy mind, and\nsuch a sweet humility in thy deportment, notwithstanding thy present\nstation, that I believe I shall be forced to love thee, whether I will\nor not: and the sight of your papers, I dare say, will crown the work;\nwill disarm my pride, banish my resentment on Lady Betty's account, and\njustify my brother's conduct; and, at the same time, redound to your own\neverlasting honour, as well as to the credit of our sex: and so I make\nno doubt but my brother will let me see them.\n\nWorden, said my lady, I can say any thing before you; and you will take\nno notice of our conversation; but I see you are much touched with it:\nDid you ever hear any thing prettier, more unaffected, sincere, free,\neasy?--No, never, madam, answered she, in my life; and it is a great\npleasure to see so happy a reconciliation taking place, where there is\nso much merit.\n\nI said, I have discovered so much prudence in Mrs. Worden, that, as well\nfor that, as for the confidence your ladyship places in her, I have made\nno scruple of speaking my mind freely before her; and of blaming my\ndear master while he was blameworthy, as well as acknowledging his\ntranscendent goodness to me since; which, I am sure, exceeds all I can\never deserve. May be not, said my lady; I hope you'll be very happy in\none another; and I'll now rise, and tell him my thoughts, and ask him\nto let me have the reading of your papers; for I promise myself much\npleasure in them; and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you, to\nthe other house, to fetch them.\n\nYour ladyship's favour, said I, was all I had to wish for; and if I have\nthat, and the continuance of your dear brother's goodness to me, I shall\nbe easy under whatever else may happen.\n\nAnd so I took my leave, and withdrew; and she let me hear her say to\nMrs. Worden, 'Tis a charming creature, Worden!--I know not which excels;\nher person, or her mind!--And so young a creature too!--Well may my\nbrother love her!\n\nI am afraid, my dear father and mother, I shall now be too proud indeed.\n\nI had once a good mind to have asked her ladyship about Miss Sally\nGodfrey; but I thought it was better let alone, since she did not\nmention It herself. May be I shall hear it too soon. But I hope not. I\nwonder, though, whether she be living or dead.\n\nWe breakfasted together with great good temper; and my lady was very\nkind, and, asking my good master, he gave leave very readily, she should\nsee all my papers, when you returned them to me; and he said, He\nwas sure, when she came to read them, she would say, that I had well\ndeserved the fortune I had met with: and would be of opinion, that all\nthe kindness of his future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for\nmy virtue, and make me amends for my sufferings.\n\nMy lady resolving to set out the next morning to return to her lord, my\nmaster ordered every thing to be made ready for his doing the like to\nBedfordshire; and this evening our good neighbours will sup with us, to\ntake leave of my lady and us.\n\n\nWednesday night.\n\nNothing particular having passed at dinner or supper, but the most\ncondescending goodness, on my lady's side, to me; and the highest\ncivilities from Mr. Peters's family, from Lady Jones, from Sir Simon's\nfamily, etc. and reciprocal good wishes all around; and a promise\nobtained from my benefactor, that he would endeavour to pass a fortnight\nor three weeks in these parts, before the winter set in; I shall\nconclude this day with observing, that I disposed of the money my\nmaster was so good to put into my hands, in the manner he was pleased to\ndirect; and I gave Mrs. Jewkes hers in such a manner as highly pleased\nher; and she wished me, with tears, all kinds of happiness; and prayed\nme to forgive her all her wickedness to me, as she herself called it. I\nbegged leave of my master to present Mrs. Worden with five guineas for a\npair of gloves; which he said was well thought of.\n\nI should have mentioned, that Miss Darnford and I agreed upon a\ncorrespondence, which will be no small pleasure to me; for she is an\nadmirable young lady, whom I prefer to every one I have seen; and I\nshall, I make no doubt, improve by her letters; for she is said to have\na happy talent in writing, and is well read, for so young a lady.\n\n\nSaturday.\n\nOn Thursday morning my lady set out for her own seat; and my best friend\nand I, attended by Mr. Colbrand, Abraham, and Thomas, for this\ndear house. Her ladyship parted with her brother and me with great\ntenderness, and made me promise to send her my papers; which I find\nshe intends to entertain Lady Betty with, and another lady or two, her\nintimates, as also her lord; and hopes to find, as I believe, in the\nreading of them, some excuse for her brother's choice.\n\nMy dearest master has been all love and tenderness on the road, as he is\nin every place, and on every occasion. And oh, what a delightful change\nwas this journey, to that which, so contrary to all my wishes, and so\nmuch to my apprehensions, carried me hence to the Lincolnshire house!\nAnd how did I bless God at every turn, and at every stage!\n\nWe did not arrive here till yesterday noon. Abraham rode before, to let\nthem know we were coming: and I had the satisfaction to find every body\nthere I wished to see.\n\nWhen the chariot entered the court-yard, I was so strongly impressed\nwith the favour and mercies of God Almighty, on remembering how I was\nsent away the last time I saw this house; the leave I took; the dangers\nI had encountered; a poor cast-off servant girl; and now returning a\njoyful wife, and the mistress, through his favour, of the noble house I\nwas turned out of; that I was hardly able to support the joy I felt in\nmy mind on the occasion. He saw how much I was moved, and tenderly asked\nme, Why I seemed so affected? I told him, and lifted his dear hand to\nmy lips, and said, O sir! God's mercies, and your goodness to me on\nentering this dear, dear place, are above my expression; I can hardly\nbear the thoughts of them!--He said, Welcome, thrice welcome, joy of my\nlife! to your own house; and kissed my hand in return. All the common\nservants stood at the windows, as unseen as they could, to observe us.\nHe took my hand, with the most condescending goodness in the world; and,\nwith great complaisance, led me into the parlour, and kissed me with\nthe greatest ardour. Welcome again, my dearest life! said he, a thousand\ntimes welcome to the possession of a house that is not more mine than\nyours!\n\nI threw myself at his feet: Permit me, dear sir, thus to bless God, and\nthank you, for all his mercies and your goodness. O may I so behave, as\nnot to be utterly unworthy; and then how happy shall I be! God give me,\nmy dearest, said he, life and health to reward all your sweetness! and\nno man can be so blest as I.\n\nWhere (said he to Abraham, who passed by the door), where is Mrs.\nJervis?--She bolted in: Here, good sir! said she; here, good madam! am\nI, waiting impatiently, till called for, to congratulate you both.--I\nran to her, and clasped my arms about her neck, and kissed her; O my\ndear Mrs. Jervis! said I, my other dear mother! receive your happy,\nhappy Pamela; and join with me to bless God, and bless our master, for\nall these great things!--I was ready to sink in her arms through excess\nof joy, to see the dear good woman, who had been so often a mournful\nwitness of my distress, as now of my triumph.--Dearest madam, said she,\nyou do me too much honour. Let my whole life shew the joy I take in your\ndeserved good fortune, and in my duty to you, for the early instance I\nreceived of your goodness in your kind letter. O Mrs. Jervis! replied\nI, there all thanks are due, both from you and me: for our dear master\ngranted me this blessing, as I may justly call it, the very first\nmoment I begged it of him. Your goodness, sir, said she, I will for ever\nacknowledge; and I beg pardon for the wrong step I made in applying to\nmy Lady Davers.--He was so good as to salute her, and said, All is over\nnow, Mrs. Jervis; and I shall not remember you ever disobliged me. I\nalways respected you, and shall now more and more value you, for the\nsake of that dear good creature, whom, with joy unfeigned, I can call\nmy wife. God bless your honour for ever! said she; and many many happy\nyears may ye live together, the envy and wonder of all who know you!\n\nBut where, said my dear master, is honest Longman? and where is\nJonathan?--Come, Mrs. Jervis, said I, you shall shew me them, and all\nthe good folks, presently; and let me go up with you to behold the dear\napartments, which I have seen before with such different emotions to\nwhat I shall now do.\n\nWe went up; and in every room, the chamber I took refuge in, when my\nmaster pursued me, my lady's chamber, her dressing-room, Mrs. Jervis's\nroom, not forgetting her closet, my own little bed-chamber, the\ngreen-room, and in each of the others, I blessed God for my past\nescapes, and present happiness; and the good woman was quite affected\nwith the zeal and pleasure with which I made my thankful acknowledgments\nto the divine goodness. O my excellent lady! said she, you are still the\nsame good, pious, humble soul I knew you; and your marriage has added to\nyour graces, as I hope it will to your blessings.\n\nDear Mrs. Jervis, said I, you know not what I have gone through! You\nknow not what God has done for me! You know not what a happy creature I\nam now! I have a thousand thousand things to tell you; and a whole week\nwill be too little, every moment of it spent in relating to you what\nhas befallen me, to make you acquainted with it all. We shall be sweetly\nhappy together, I make no doubt. But I charge you, my dear Mrs. Jervis,\nwhatever you call me before strangers, that when we are by ourselves you\ncall me nothing but your Pamela. For what an ungrateful creature should\nI be, who have received so many mercies, if I attributed them not to the\ndivine goodness, but assumed to myself insolent airs upon them! No, I\nhope I shall be, more and more thankful, as I am more and more blest!\nand more humble, as God, the author of all my happiness, shall more\ndistinguish me.\n\nWe went down again to the parlour, to my dear master. Said he, Call\nLongman in again; he longs to see you, my dear. He came in: God bless\nyou, my sweet lady, said he; as now, Heaven be praised, I may call you!\nDid I not tell you, madam, that Providence would find you out? O, Mr.\nLongman, said I, God be praised for all his mercies! I am rejoiced to\nsee you; and I laid my hand on his, and said, Good Mr. Longman, how\ndo you do?--I must always value you; and you don't know how much of my\npresent happiness I owe to the sheets of paper, and pens and ink, you\nfurnished me with. I hope my dear sir and you are quite reconciled.--O,\nmadam, said he, how good you are! Why, I cannot contain myself for joy!\nand then he wiped his eyes; good man!\n\nSaid my master, Yes, I have been telling Longman that I am obliged to\nhim for his ready return to me; and that I will entirely forget his\nappeal to Lady Davers; and I hope he'll find himself quite as easy and\nhappy as he wishes. My dear partner here, Mr. Longman, I dare promise\nyou, will do all she can to make you so.--Heaven bless you both\ntogether! said he. 'Tis the pride of my heart to see this! I returned\nwith double delight, when I heard the blessed news; and I am sure, sir,\nsaid he, (mark old Longman's words,) God will bless you for this every\nyear more and more! You don't know how many hearts you have made happy\nby this generous deed!--I am glad of it, said my dear master; I am\nsure I have made my own happy: and, Longman, though I must think you\nSOMEBODY, yet, as you are not a young man, and so won't make me jealous,\nI can allow you to wish my dear wife joy in the tenderest manner. Adad!\nsir, said he, I am sure you rejoice me with your favour: 'Tis what I\nlonged for, but durst not presume. My dear, said my master, receive\nthe compliment of one of the honestest hearts in England, that always\nrevered your virtues!--and the good man saluted me with great respect,\nand said, God in Heaven bless you both! and kneeled on one knee. I must\nquit your presence! Indeed I must!--And away he went.\n\nYour goodness, sir, said I, knows no bounds: O may my gratitude never\nfind any!--I saw, said my master, when the good man approached you, that\nhe did it with so much awe and love mingled together, that I fancied he\nlonged to salute my angel; and I could not but indulge his honest\nheart. How blessed am I! said I, and kissed his hand.--And indeed I make\nnothing now of kissing his dear hand, as if it was my own!\n\nWhen honest old Mr. Jonathan come in to attend at dinner, so clean, so\nsleek, and so neat, as he always is, with his silver hair, I said, Well,\nMr. Jonathan, how do you do? I am glad to see you.--You look as well as\never, thank God! O, dear madam! said he, better than ever, to have such\na blessed sight! God bless you and my good master!--and I hope, sir,\nsaid he, you'll excuse all my past failings. Ay, that I will, Jonathan,\nsaid he; because you never had any, but what your regard for my dear\nwife here was the occasion of. And now I can tell you, you can never\nerr, because you cannot respect her too much. O sir, said he, your\nhonour is exceeding good! I'm sure I shall always pray for you both.\n\nAfter dinner, Mr. Longman coming in, and talking of some affairs under\nhis care, he said afterwards, All your honour's servants are now happy;\nfor Robert, who left you, had a pretty little fortune fallen to him, or\nhe never would have quitted your service. He was here but yesterday, to\ninquire when you and my lady returned hither; and hoped he might have\nleave to pay his duty to you both. Ay, said my master, I shall be glad\nto see honest Robert; for that's another of your favourites, Pamela. It\nwas high time, I think, I should marry you, were it but to engage\nthe respects of all my family to myself.--There are, sir, said I, ten\nthousand reasons why I should rejoice in your goodness.\n\nBut I was going to say, said Mr. Longman, That all your honour's old\nservants are now happy, but one. You mean John Arnold? said my master. I\ndo, indeed, said he, if you'll excuse me, sir. O, said I, I have had my\nprayer for poor John answered, as favourably as I could wish.--Why, said\nMr. Longman, to be sure poor John has acted no very good part, take it\naltogether; but he so much honoured you, sir, and so much respected you,\nmadam, that he would have been glad to have been obedient to both; and\nso was faithful to neither. But, indeed, the poor fellow's heart is\nalmost broke, and he won't look out for any other place; and says,\nhe must live in your honour's service, or he must die wretched very\nshortly. Mrs. Jervis was there when this was said: Indeed, said she, the\npoor man has been here every day since he heard the tidings, that have\nrejoiced us all; and he says, he hopes he shall yet be forgiven. Is he\nin the house now? said my master. He is, sir; and was here when your\nhonour came in, and played at hide and seek to have one look at you both\nwhen you alighted; and was ready to go out of his wits for joy, when we\nsaw your honour hand my lady in. Pamela, said my dear master, you're to\ndo with John as you please. You have full power. Then pray, sir, said I,\nlet poor John come in.\n\nThe poor fellow came in, with so much confusion, that I have never seen\na countenance that expressed so lively a consciousness of his faults,\nand mingled joy and shame. How do you do, John? said I; I hope you are\nvery well!--The poor fellow could hardly speak, and looked with awe upon\nmy master, and pleasure upon me. Said my master, Well, John, there is\nno room to say any thing to a man that has so much concern already: I\nam told you will serve me whether I will or not; but I turn you over\naltogether to my spouse here: and she is to do by you as she pleases.\nYou see, John, said I, your good master's indulgence. Well may I\nforgive, that have so generous an example. I was always persuaded of\nyour honest intentions, if you had known how to distinguish between your\nduty to your master, and your good-will to me: You will now have no more\npuzzles on that account, from the goodness of your dear master. I shall\nbe but too happy I said the poor man. God bless your honour! God bless\nyou, madam!--I now have the joy of my soul, in serving you both; and I\nwill make the best of servants, to my power. Well, then, John, said I,\nyour wages will go on, as if you had not left your master: May I not say\nso, sir? said I. Yes, surely, my dear, replied he; and augment them too,\nif you find his duty to you deserves it. A thousand millions of thanks,\nsaid the poor man: I am very well satisfied, and desire no augmentation.\nAnd so he withdrew, overjoyed; and Mrs. Jervis and Mr. Longman were\nhighly pleased; for though they were incensed against him for his\nfault to me, when matters looked badly for me, yet they, and all his\nfellow-servants, always loved John.\n\nWhen Mr. Longman and Mrs. Jervis had dined, they came in again, to know\nif he had any commands; and my dear master, filling a glass of wine,\nsaid, Longman, I am going to toast the happiest and honestest couple in\nEngland, my dear Pamela's father and mother.--Thank you, dear sir, said\nI.\n\nI think, continued he, that little Kentish purchase wants a manager; and\nas it is a little out of your way, Longman, I have been purposing, if I\nthought Mr. Andrews would accept it, that he should enter upon Hodge's\nfarm that was, and so manage for me that whole little affair; and we\nwill well stock the farm for him, and make it comfortable; and I think,\nif he will take that trouble upon him, it will be an ease to you, and a\nfavour to me.\n\nYour honour, said he, cannot do a better thing; and I have had some\ninkling given me, that you may, if you please, augment that estate, by\na purchase, of equal amount, contiguous to it; and as you have so much\nmoney to spare, I can't see your honour can do better. Well, said he,\nlet me have the particulars another time, and we will consider about\nit. But, my dear, added he, you'll mention this to your father, if you\nplease.\n\nI have too much money, Longman, continued he, lies useless; though, upon\nthis occasion, I shall not grudge laying out as much in liveries\nand other things, as if I had married a lady of a fortune equal, if\npossible, to my Pamela's merit; and I reckon you have a good deal in\nhand. Yes, sir, said he, more than I wish I had. But I have a mortgage\nin view, if you don't buy that Kentish thing, that I believe will answer\nvery well; and when matters are riper, will mention it to your honour.\n\nI took with me, to Lincolnshire, said my master, upwards of six hundred\nguineas, and thought to have laid most of them out there: (Thank God,\nthought I, you did not! for he offered me five hundred of them, you\nknow:) but I have not laid out above two hundred and fifty of them; so\ntwo hundred I left there in my escritoire; because I shall go again for\na fortnight or so, before winter; and two hundred I have brought with\nme: and I have money, I know not what, in three places here, the account\nof which is in my pocket-book, in my library.\n\nYou have made some little presents, Pamela, to my servants there, on our\nnuptials; and these two hundred that I have brought up, I will put into\nyour disposal, that, with some of them, you shall do here as you did\nthere.\n\nI am ashamed, good sir, said I, to be so costly, and so worthless! Pray,\nmy dear, replied he, say not a word of that. Said Mr. Longman, Why,\nmadam, with money in stocks, and one thing or another, his honour could\nbuy half the gentlemen around him. He wants not money, and lays up every\nyear. And it would have been pity but his honour should have wedded\njust as he has. Very true, Longman, said my master; and, pulling out\nhis purse, said, Tell out, my dear, two hundred guineas, and give me the\nrest.--I did so. Now, said he, take them yourself, for the purposes I\nmentioned. But, Mr. Longman, do you, before sunset, bring my dear girl\nfifty pounds, which is due to her this day, by my promise; and every\nthree months, from this day, pay her fifty pounds; which will be two\nhundred pounds per annum; and this is for her to lay out at her own\ndiscretion, and without account, in such a way as shall derive a\nblessing upon us all: for she was my mother's almoner, and shall be\nmine, and her own too.--I'll go for it this instant, said Mr. Longman.\n\nWhen he was done, I looked upon my dear generous master, and on Mrs.\nJervis, and he gave me a nod of assent; and I took twenty guineas,\nand said, Dear Mrs. Jervis, accept of this, which is no more than my\ngenerous master ordered me to present to Mrs. Jewkes, for a pair of\ngloves, on my happy nuptials; and so you, who are much better entitled\nto them by the love I bear you, must not refuse them.\n\nSaid she, Mrs. Jewkes was on the spot, madam, at the happy time. Yes,\nsaid my master; but Pamela would have rejoiced to have had you there\ninstead of her. That I should, sir, replied I, or instead of any body,\nexcept my own mother. She gratefully accepted them, and thanked us both:\nBut I don't know what she should thank me for; for I was not worth a\nfourth of them myself.\n\nI'd have you, my dear, said he, in some handsome manner, as you know\nhow, oblige Longman to accept of the like present.\n\nMr. Longman returned from his office, and brought me the fifty pounds,\nsaying, I have entered this new article with great pleasure: 'To my Lady\nfifty pounds: to be paid the same sum quarterly.' O sir! said I,\nwhat will become of me, to be so poor in myself, and so rich in your\nbounty!--It is a shame to take all that your profuse goodness would\nheap upon me thus: But indeed it shall not be without account.--Make no\nwords, my dear, said he: Are you not my wife? And have I not endowed you\nwith my goods; and, hitherto, this is a very small part.\n\nMr. Longman, said I, and Mrs. Jervis, you both see how I am even\noppressed with unreturnable obligations. God bless the donor, and the\nreceiver too! said Mr. Longman: I am sure they will bring back good\ninterest; for, madam, you had ever a bountiful heart; and I have seen\nthe pleasure you used to take to dispense my late lady's alms and\ndonations.\n\nI'll warrant, Mr. Longman, said I, notwithstanding you are so willing to\nhave me take large sums for nothing at all, I should affront you, if\nI asked you to accept from me a pair of gloves only, on account of my\nhappy nuptials. He seemed not readily to know how to answer; and my\nmaster said, If Longman refuse you, my dear, he may be said to refuse\nyour first favour. On that I put twenty guineas in his hand; but he\ninsisted upon it, that he would take but five. I said, I must desire you\nto oblige me, Mr. Longman, or I shall think I have affronted you. Well,\nif I must, said he, I know what I know. What is that, Mr. Longman? said\nI.--Why, madam, said he, I will not lay it out till my young master's\nbirth-day, which I hope will be within this twelvemonth.\n\nNot expecting anything like this from the old gentleman, I looked at\nmy master, and then blushed so, I could not hold up my head. Charmingly\nsaid, Longman! said my master, and clasped me in his arms: O, my dear\nlife! God send it may be so!--You have quite delighted me, Longman!\nThough I durst not have said such a thing for the world.--Madam, said\nthe old gentleman, I beg your pardon; I hope no offence: but I'd speak\nit ten times in a breath to have it so, take it how you please, as long\nas my good master takes it so well. Mrs. Jervis, said my master, this is\nan over-nice dear creature; you don't know what a life I have had with\nher, even on this side matrimony.--Said Mrs. Jervis, I think Mr. Longman\nsays very well; I am sure I shall hope for it too.\n\nMr. Longman, who had struck me of a heap, withdrawing soon after, my\nmaster said, Why, my dear, you can't look up! The old man said nothing\nshocking. I did not expect it, though, from him, said I. I was not aware\nbut of some innocent pleasantry. Why, so it was, said he, both innocent\nand pleasant: and I won't forgive you, if you don't say as he says.\nCome, speak before Mrs. Jervis. May every thing happen, sir, said I,\nthat will give you delight!--That's my dearest love, said he, and kissed\nme with great tenderness.\n\nWhen the servants had dined, I desired to see the maidens; and all four\ncame up together. You are welcome home, madam, said Rachel; we rejoice\nall to see you here, and more to see you our lady. O my good old\nacquaintances, said I, I joy to see you! How do you do, Rachel? How do\nyou all do? And I took each of them by the hand, and could have kissed\nthem. For, said I to myself, I kissed you all, last time I saw you, in\nsorrow; why should I not kiss you all with joy? But I forbore, in honour\nof their master's presence.\n\nThey seemed quite transported with me: and my good master was pleased\nwith the scene. See here, my lasses, said he, your mistress! I need not\nbid you respect her; for you always loved her; and she'll have it as\nmuch in her power as inclination to be kind to the deserving. Indeed,\nsaid I, I shall always be a kind friend to you; and your dear master has\nordered me to give each of you this, that you may rejoice with me on my\nhappiness. And so I gave them five guineas a-piece, and said, God bless\nyou every one! I am overjoyed to see you! And they withdrew with the\ngreatest gratitude and pleasure, praying for us both.\n\nI turned to my dear master: 'Tis to you, dear sir, said I, next to God,\nwho put it into your generous heart, that all my happiness is owing!\nThat my mind thus overflows with joy and gratitude! And I would have\nkissed his hand; but he clasped me in his arms, and said, You deserve\nit, my dear: You deserve it all. Mrs. Jervis came in. Said she, I have\nseen a very affecting sight; you have made your maidens quite happy,\nmadam, with your kindness and condescension! I saw them all four, as\nI came by the hall-door, just got up from their knees, praising and\npraying for you both! Dear good bodies! said I; and did Jane pray too?\nMay their prayers be returned upon themselves, I say!\n\nMy master sent for Jonathan, and I held up all the fingers of my two\nhands; and my master giving a nod of approbation as he came in, I said,\nWell, Mr. Jonathan, I could not be satisfied without seeing you in form,\nas it were, and thanking you for all your past good-will to me. You'll\naccept of that, for a pair of gloves, on this happy occasion; and I gave\nhim ten guineas, and took his honest hand between both mine: God bless\nyou, said I, with your silver hairs, so like my dear father!--I shall\nalways value such a good old servant of the best of masters!--He said, O\nsuch goodness! Such kind words! It is balm to my heart! Blessed be God\nI have lived to this day!--And his eyes swam in tears, and he\nwithdrew.--My dear, said my master, you make every one happy!--O, sir,\nsaid I, 'tis you, 'tis you! And let my grateful heart always spring to\nmy lips, to acknowledge the blessings you heap upon me.\n\nThen in came Harry, and Isaac, and Benjamin, and the two grooms of this\nhouse, and Arthur the gardener; for my dear master had ordered them, by\nMrs. Jervis, thus to be marshalled out: and he said, Where's John? Poor\nJohn was ashamed, and did not come in till he heard himself called for.\nI said to them, How do you do, my old friends and fellow-servants? I am\nglad to see you all.\n\nMy master said, I have given you a mistress, my lads, that is the joy of\nmy heart: You see her goodness and condescension! Let your respects to\nher be but answerable, and she'll be proportionately as great a blessing\nto you all, as she is to me. Harry said, In the names of all your\nservants, sir, I bless your honour, and your good lady: and it shall\nbe all our studies to deserve her ladyship's favours, as well as your\nhonour's. And so I gave every one five guineas, to rejoice, as I said,\nin my happiness.\n\nWhen I came to John, I said, I saw you before, John; but I again tell\nyou, I am glad to see you. He said, he was quite ashamed and confounded.\nO, said I, forget every thing that's past, John!--Your dear good master\nwill, and so will I. For God has wonderfully brought about all these\nthings, by the very means I once thought most grievous. Let us,\ntherefore, look forward, and be only ashamed to commit faults for\nthe time to come: for they may not always be attended with like happy\nconsequences.\n\nArthur, said my master, I have brought you a mistress that is a great\ngardener. She'll shew you a new way to plant beans: And never any body\nhad such a hand at improving a sun-flower as she!--O sir, sir, said I,\n(but yet a little dashed,) all my improvements in every kind of thing\nare owing to you, I am sure!--And so I think I was even with the dear\nman, and yet appeared grateful before his servants. They withdrew,\nblessing us both, as the rest had done. And then came in the postilion,\nand two helpers, (for my master has both here, and at Lincolnshire, fine\nhunting horses; and it is the chief sport he takes delight in,) as also\nthe scullion-boy: And I said, How do all of you? And how dost do, Tommy?\nI hope you're very good. Here your dear master has ordered you something\na-piece, in honour of me. And my master holding three fingers to me, I\ngave the postilion and helpers three guineas each, and the little boy\ntwo; and bid him let his poor mother lay it out for him, for he must not\nspend it idly. Mr. Colbrand, Abraham, and Thomas, I had before presented\nat t'other house.\n\nAnd when they were all gone but Mrs. Jervis, I said, And now, dearest\nsir, permit me, on my knees, thus to bless you, and pray for you. And\noh, may God crown you with length of days, and increase of honour;\nand may your happy, happy Pamela, by her grateful heart, appear always\nworthy in your dear eyes, though she cannot be so in her own, nor in\nthose of any others!\n\nMrs. Jervis, said my master, you see the excellency of this sweet\ncreature! And when I tell you that the charms of her person, all lovely\nas she is, bind me not so strongly to her, as the graces of her mind;\ncongratulate me, that my happiness is built on so stable a basis. Indeed\nI do, most sincerely, sir, said she: This is a happy day to me!\n\nI stept into the library, while he was thus pouring out his kindness for\nme to Mrs. Jervis; and blessed God there on my knees, for the difference\nI now found to what I had once known in it.--And when I have done the\nsame in the first scene of my fears, the once frightful summer-house,\nI shall have gone through most of my distressful scenes with gratitude;\nbut shall never forbear thanking God in my mind, for his goodness to\nme in every one. Mrs. Jervis, I find, had whispered him what I had done\nabove, and he saw me upon my knees, with my back towards him, unknown to\nme; but softly put to the door again, as he had opened it a little way.\nAnd I said, not knowing he had seen me, You have some charming pictures\nhere, sir.--Yes, said he, my dear life, so I have; but none equal to\nthat which your piety affords me; And may the God you delight to\nserve, bless more and more my dear angel!--Sir, said I, you are all\ngoodness!--I hope, replied he, after your sweet example, I shall be\nbetter and better.\n\nDo you think, my dear father and mother, there ever was so happy a\ncreature as I? To be sure it would be very ungrateful to think with\nuneasiness, or any thing but compassion, of poor Miss Sally Godfrey.\n\nHe ordered Jonathan to let the evening be passed merrily, but wisely, as\nhe said, with what every one liked, whether wine or October.\n\nHe was pleased afterwards to lead me up stairs, and gave me possession\nof my lady's dressing-room and cabinet, and her fine repeating-watch and\nequipage; and, in short, of a complete set of diamonds, that were his\ngood mother's; as also of the two pair of diamond ear-rings, the\ntwo diamond rings, and diamond necklace, he mentioned in his naughty\narticles, which her ladyship had intended for presents to Miss Tomlins,\na rich heiress, that was proposed for his wife, when he was just come\nfrom his travels; but which went off, after all was agreed upon on both\nthe friends' sides, because he approved not her conversation; and she\nhad, as he told his mother, too masculine an air; and he never could\nbe brought to see her but once, though the lady liked him very well.\nHe presented me also with her ladyship's books, pictures, linen, laces,\netc. that were in her apartments; and bid me call those apartments mine.\nO give me, my good God! humility and gratitude.\n\n\nSunday night.\n\nThis day, as matters could not be ready for our appearance at a better\nplace, we staid at home; and my dear master employed himself a good deal\nin his library: And I have been taken up pretty much, I hope, as I ought\nto be, in thankfulness, prayer and meditation, in my newly-presented\ncloset And I hope God will be pleased to give a blessing to me; for\nI have the pleasure to think I am not puffed up with this great\nalteration; and yet am I not wanting to look upon all these favours\nand blessings in the light wherein I ought to receive them, both at the\nhands of Heaven, and my dear benefactor.\n\nWe dined together with great pleasure; and I had, in every word and\naction, all the instances of kindness and affection that the most\nindulged heart could wish. He said he would return to his closet again;\nand at five o'clock would come and take a walk with me in the garden:\nAnd so retired as soon as he had dined, and I went up to mine.\n\nAbout six, he was pleased to come up to me, and said, Now, my dear, I\nwill attend you for a little walk in the garden; and I gave him my hand\nwith great pleasure.\n\nThis garden is much better cultivated than the Lincolnshire one; but\nthat is larger, and has nobler walks in it; and yet there is a pretty\ncanal in this, and a fountain and cascade. We had a deal of sweet\nconversation as we walked; and, after we had taken a turn round, I bent\ntowards the little garden; and when I came near the summer-house, took\nthe opportunity to slip from him, and just whipt up the steps of this\nonce frightful place, and kneeled down, and said, I bless thee, O God!\nfor my escapes, and for thy mercies! O let me always possess a grateful,\nhumble heart! and I whipt down again and joined him; and he hardly\nmissed me.\n\nSeveral of the neighbouring gentry sent their compliments to him on his\nreturn, but not a word about his marriage; particularly Mr. Arthur, Mr.\nTowers, Mr. Brooks, and Mr. Martin of the Grove.\n\n\nMonday.\n\nI had a good deal of employment in choosing patterns for my new clothes.\nHe thought nothing too good; but I thought every thing I saw was; and he\nwas so kind to pick out six of the richest for me to choose three suits\nout of, saying, We would furnish ourselves with more in town, when we\nwent thither. One was white, flowered with silver most richly; and he\nwas pleased to say, that, as I was a bride, I should make my appearance\nin that the following Sunday. And so we shall have in two or three days,\nfrom several places, nothing but mantua-makers and tailors at work.\nBless me! what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy I am to the dear\ngentleman!--But his fortune and station require a great deal of it;\nand his value for me will not let him do less, than if he had married a\nfortune equal to his own: and then, as he says, it would be a reflection\nupon him, if he did.--And so I doubt it will be, as it is: For either\nway the world will have something to say. He made me also choose some\nvery fine laces, and linen; and has sent a message on purpose, with his\norders, to hasten all down, what can be done in town, as the millinery\nmatters, etc. to be completed there, and sent by particular messengers,\nas done. All to be here, and finished by Saturday afternoon, without\nfail.\n\nI sent away John this morning, with some more of my papers to you, and\nwith the few he will give you separate. My desire is, that you will send\nme all the papers you have done with, that I may keep my word with Lady\nDavers; to beg the continuance of your prayers and blessings; to hope\nyou will give me your answer about my dear benefactor's proposal of\nthe Kentish farm; to beg you to buy, two suits of clothes each; of the\nfinest cloth for you, my dear father; and of a creditable silk for my\ndear mother; and good linen, and every thing answerable; and that you\nwill, as my best friend bid me say, let us see you here as soon as\npossible; and he will have his chariot come for you, when you tell John\nthe day. Oh! how I long to see you both, my dear good parents, and to\nshare with you my felicities!\n\nYou will have, I'm sure, the goodness to go to all your creditors, which\nare chiefly those of my poor unhappy brothers, and get an account of all\nyou are bound for; and every one shall be paid to the utmost farthing,\nand interest besides, though some of them have been very cruel\nand unrelenting.--But they are entitled to their own, and shall be\nthankfully paid.\n\nNow I think of it, John shall take my papers down to this place; that\nyou may have something to amuse you, of your dear child's, instead of\nthose you part with; and I will continue writing till I am settled, and\nyou are determined; and then I shall apply myself to the duties of the\nfamily, in order to become as useful to my dear benefactor, as my small\nabilities will let me.\n\nIf you think a couple of guineas will be of use to Mrs. Mumford, who,\nI doubt, has not much aforehand, pray give them to her, from me, (and\nI will return them to you,) as for a pair of gloves on my nuptials: And\nlook through your poor acquaintances and neighbours, and let me have a\nlist of such honest industrious poor, as may be true objects of charity,\nand have no other assistance; particularly such as are blind, lame,\nor sickly, with their several cases; and also such poor families and\nhousekeepers as are reduced by misfortunes, as ours was, and where\na great number of children may keep them from rising to a state of\ntolerable comfort: And I will choose as well as I can; for I long to\nbe making a beginning, with the kind quarterly benevolence my dear good\nbenefactor has bestowed upon me for such good purposes.\n\nI am resolved to keep account of all these matters, and Mr. Longman has\nalready furnished me with a vellum book of white paper; some sides of\nwhich I hope soon to fill with the names of proper objects: And though\nmy dear master has given me all this without account, yet shall he see\n(but nobody else) how I lay it out, from quarter to quarter; and I will,\nif any be left, carry it on, like an accomptant, to the next quarter,\nand strike a balance four times a year, and a general balance at\nevery year's end.--And I have written in it, Humble RETURNS for DIVINE\nMERCIES; and locked it up safe in my newly-presented cabinet.\n\nI intend to let Lady Davers see no farther of my papers, than to her own\nangry letter to her brother; for I would not have her see my reflections\nupon it; and she'll know, down to that place, all that's necessary for\nher curiosity, as to my sufferings, and the stratagems used against me,\nand the honest part I have been enabled to act: And I hope, when she has\nread them all, she will be quite reconciled: for she will see it is all\nGod Almighty's doings; and that a gentleman of his parts and knowledge\nwas not to be drawn in by such a poor young body as me.\n\nI will detain John no longer. He will tell you to read this last part\nfirst, and while he stays. And so, with my humble duty to you both, and\nmy dear Mr. B----'s kind remembrance, I rest\n\n                       Your ever-dutiful and gratefully happy DAUGHTER.\n\n\nWednesday evening.\n\nHONOURED FATHER AND MOTHER!\n\nI will now proceed with my journal.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, my dear sir rode out, and brought with him to\ndinner, Mr. Martin of the Grove, and Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Brooks, and one\nMr. Chambers; and he stept up to me, and said he had rode out too far\nto return to breakfast; but he had brought with him some of his old\nacquaintance, to dine with me. Are you sorry for it, Pamela? said he. I\nremembered his lessons, and said No, sure, sir; I cannot be angry at any\nthing you are pleased to do. Said he, You know Mr. Martin's character,\nand have severely censured him in one of your letters, as one of my\nbrother rakes, and for his three lyings-in.\n\nHe then gave me the following account, how he came to bring them. Said\nhe, 'I met them all at Mr. Arthur's; and his lady asked me, if I was\nreally married? I said, Yes, really. And to whom? said Mr. Martin. Why,\nreplied I, bluntly, to my mother's waiting-maid. They could not tell\nwhat to say to me hereupon, and looked one upon another. And I saw I had\nspoiled a jest, from each. Mrs. Arthur said, You have, indeed, sir, a\ncharming creature, as ever I saw; and she has mighty good luck. Ay, said\nI, and so have I. But I shall say the less, because a man never did any\nthing of this nature, that he did not think he ought, if it were but\nin policy, to make the best of it. Nay, said Mr. Arthur, if you have\nsinned, it is with your eyes open: for you know the world as well as any\ngentleman of your years in it.'\n\n'Why, really, gentlemen, said I, I should be glad to please all my\nfriends; but I can't expect, till they know my motives and inducements,\nthat it will be so immediately. But I do assure you, I am exceedingly\npleased myself; and that, you know, is most to the purpose.'\n\n'Said Mr. Brooks, I have heard my wife praise your spouse that is, so\nmuch for person and beauty, that I wanted to see her of all things. Why,\nreplied I, if you'll all go and take a dinner with me, you shall see\nher with all my heart. And, Mrs. Arthur, will you bear us company? No,\nindeed, sir, said she. What, I'll warrant, my wife will not be able to\nreconcile you to my mother's waiting-maid; is not that it? Tell truth,\nMrs. Arthur. Nay, said she, I shan't be backward to pay your spouse a\nvisit, in company of the neighbouring ladies; but for one single woman\nto go, on such a sudden motion too, with so many gentlemen, is not\nright. But that need not hinder you, gentlemen. So, said he, the rest\nsent, that they should not dine at home; and they and Mr. Chambers, a\ngentleman lately settled in these parts, one and all came with me: And\nso, my dear, concluded he, when you make your appearance next Sunday,\nyou're sure of a party in your favour; for all that see you must esteem\nyou.'\n\nHe went to them; and when I came down to dinner, he was pleased to take\nme by the hand, at my entrance into the parlour, and said, My dear, I\nhave brought some of my good neighbours to dine with you. I said, You\nare very good, sir.--My dear, this gentleman is Mr. Chambers; and so he\npresented every one to me; and they saluted me, and wished us both joy.\n\nI, for my part, said Mr. Brooks, wish you joy most heartily. My wife\ntold me a good deal of the beauties of your person; but I did not think\nwe had such a flower in our country. Sir, said I, your lady is very\npartial to me; and you are so polite a gentleman, that you will not\ncontradict your good lady.\n\nI'll assure you, madam, returned he, you have not hit the matter at all;\nfor we contradict one another twice or thrice a day. But the devil's\nin't if we are not agreed in so clear a case!\n\nSaid Mr. Martin, Mr. Brooks says very true, madam, in both respects;\n(meaning his wife's and his own contradiction to one another, as well as\nin my favour;) for, added he, they have been married some years.\n\nAs I had not the best opinion of this gentleman, nor his jest, I said,\nI am almost sorry, sir, for the gentleman's jest upon himself and his\nlady; but I think it should have relieved him from a greater jest, your\npleasant confirmation of it.--But still the reason you give that it may\nbe so, I hope, is the reason that may be given that it is not so; to\nwit, that they have been married some years.\n\nSaid Mr. Arthur, Mr. Martin, I think the lady has very handsomely\nreproved you. I think so too, said Mr. Chambers; and it was but a very\nindifferent compliment to a bride. Said Mr. Martin, Compliment or not,\ngentlemen, I have never seen a matrimony of any time standing, that it\nwas not so, little or much: But I dare say it will never be so here.\n\nTo be sure, sir, said I, if it was, I must be the ungratefullest person\nin the world, because I am the most obliged person in it. That notion,\nsaid Mr. Arthur, is so excellent, that it gives a moral certainty it\nnever can.\n\nSir, said Mr. Brooks to my dear master, softly, You have a most\naccomplished lady, I do assure you, as well in her behaviour and wit,\nas in her person, call her what you please. Why, my dear friend, said my\nmaster, I must tell you, as I have said before now, that her person made\nme her lover, but her mind made her my wife.\n\nThe first course coming in, my dear sir led me himself to my place; and\nset Mr. Chambers, as the greatest stranger, at my right hand, and Mr.\nBrooks at my left; and Mr. Arthur was pleased to observe, much to my\nadvantage, on the ease and freedom with which I behaved myself, and\nhelped them; and said, he would bring his lady to be a witness, and a\nlearner both, of my manners. I said, I should be proud of any honour\nMrs. Arthur would vouchsafe to do me; and if once I could promise myself\nthe opportunity of his good lady's example, and those of the other\ngentlemen present, I should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to\nsit in the place I filled at present with much insufficiency.\n\nMr. Arthur drank to my health and happiness, and said, My wife told your\nspouse, madam, you had very good luck in such a husband; but I now\nsee who has the best of it. Said Mr. Brooks, Come, come, let's make no\ncompliments; for the plain truth of the matter is, our good neighbour's\ngenerosity and judgment have met with so equal a match in his lady's\nbeauty and merit, that I know not which has the best luck. But may you\nbe both long happy together, say I! And so he drank a glass of wine.\n\nMy best friend, who always takes delight to have me praised, seemed much\npleased with our conversation; and he said the kindest, tenderest, and\nmost respectful things in the world to me. Insomuch, that the rough\nMr. Martin said, Did you ever think our good friend here, who used to\nridicule matrimony so much, would have made so complaisant a husband?\nHow long do you intend, sir, that this shall hold? As long as my good\ngirl deserves it, said he; and that, I hope, will be for ever. But,\ncontinued the kind gentleman, you need not wonder I have changed my mind\nas to wedlock; for I never expected to meet with one whose behaviour and\nsweetness of temper were so well adapted to make me happy.\n\nAfter dinner, and having drank good healths to each of their ladies, I\nwithdrew; and they sat and drank two bottles of claret a-piece, and were\nvery merry; and went away, full of my praises, and vowing to bring their\nladies to see me.\n\n\nJohn having brought me your kind letter, my dear father, I told my good\nmaster, after his friends were gone, how gratefully you received his\ngenerous intentions as to the Kentish farm, and promised your best\nendeavours to serve him in that estate; and that you hoped your industry\nand care would be so well employed in it, that you should be very little\ntroublesome to him,--as to the liberal manner in which he had intended\nto add to a provision, that of itself exceeded all you wished. He was\nvery well pleased with your cheerful acceptance of it.\n\nI am glad your engagements in the world lie in so small a compass. As\nsoon as you have gotten an account of them exactly, you will be pleased\nto send it me, with the list of the poor folks you are so kind to\npromise to procure me.\n\nI think, as my dear master is so generous, you should account nothing\nthat is plain, too good. Pray don't be afraid of laying out upon\nyourselves. My dear sir intends that you shall not, when you come to us,\nreturn to your old abode; but stay with us, till you set out for Kent;\nand so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly. And I hope, my dear\nfather, you have quite left off all slavish business. As farmer Jones\nhas been kind to you, as I have heard you say, pray, when you take leave\nof them, present them with three guineas worth of good books; such as\na family bible, a common prayer, a whole duty of man, or any other you\nthink will be acceptable; for they live a great way from church; and in\nwinter the ways from their farm thither are impassable.\n\nHe has brought me my papers safe: and I will send them to Lady Davers\nthe first opportunity, down to the place I mentioned in my last.\n\nMy dear Mr. B---- just now tells me, that he will carry me, in the\nmorning, a little airing, about ten miles off, in his chariot and four,\nto breakfast at a farm-house, noted for a fine dairy, and where, now and\nthen, the neighbouring gentry, of both sexes, resort for that purpose.\n\n\nThursday.\n\nWe set out at about half an hour after six, accordingly; and driving\npretty smartly, got at this truly neat house at half an hour after\neight; and I was much pleased with the neatness of the good woman, and\nher daughter and maid; and he was so good as to say he would now and\nthen take a turn with me to the same place, and on the same occasion, as\nI seemed to like it; for that it would be a pretty exercise, and procure\nus appetites to our breakfasts, as well as our return would to our\ndinners. But I find this was not, though a very good reason, the only\none for which he gave me this agreeable airing; as I shall acquaint you.\n\nWe were prettily received and entertained here, and an elegancy ran\nthrough every thing, persons as well as furniture, yet all plain. And my\nmaster said to the good housewife, Do your young boarding-school ladies\nstill at times continue their visits to you, Mrs. Dobson? Yes, sir, said\nshe, I expect three or four of them every minute.\n\nThere is, my dear, said he, within three miles of this farm, a very good\nboarding-school for ladies. The governess of it keeps a chaise and pair,\nwhich is to be made a double chaise at pleasure; and in summer time,\nwhen the misses perform their tasks to satisfaction, she favours them\nwith an airing to this place, three or four at a time; and after they\nhave breakfasted, they are carried back. And this serves both for a\nreward, and for exercise; and the misses who have this favour are not\na little proud of it; and it brings them forward in their respective\ntasks.\n\nA very good method, sir, said I. And just as we were talking, the chaise\ncame in with four misses, all pretty much of a size, and a maid-servant\nto attend them. They were shewn another little neat apartment, that went\nthrough ours; and made their honours very prettily, as they passed by\nus. I went into the room to them, and asked them questions about their\nwork, and their lessons; and what they had done to deserve such a fine\nairing and breakfasting; and they all answered me very prettily. And\npray, little ladies, said I, what may I call your names? One was called\nMiss Burdoff, one Miss Nugent, one Miss Booth, and the fourth Miss\nGoodwin. I don't know which, said I, is the prettiest; but you are all\nbest, my little dears; and you have a very good governess, to indulge\nyou with such a fine airing, and such delicate cream, and bread and\nbutter. I hope you think so too.\n\nMy master came in, and I had no mistrust in the world; and he kissed\neach of them; but looked more wishfully on Miss Goodwin, than on any of\nthe others; but I thought nothing just then: Had she been called Miss\nGodfrey, I had hit upon it in a trice.\n\nWhen we went from them, he said, Which do you think the prettiest of\nthose misses? Really, sir, replied I, it is hard to say: Miss Booth is a\npretty brown girl, and has a fine eye; Miss Burdoff has a great deal\nof sweetness in her countenance, but is not so regularly featured. Miss\nNugent is very fair: and Miss Goodwin has a fine black eye, and is,\nbesides, I think, the genteelest shaped child; but they are all pretty.\n\nThe maid led them into the garden, to shew them the beehives; and Miss\nGoodwin made a particular fine courtesy to my master; and I said, I\nbelieve miss knows you, sir; and, taking her by the hand, I said, Do you\nknow this gentleman, my pretty dear?--Yes, madam, said she; it is my own\ndear uncle. I clasped her in my arms: O why did you not tell me, sir,\nsaid I, that you had a niece among these little ladies? And I kissed\nher, and away she tript after the others.\n\nBut pray, sir, said I, how can this be?--You have no sister nor brother,\nbut Lady Davers.--How can this be?\n\nHe smiled: and then I said, O my dearest sir, tell me now the truth,\nDoes not this pretty miss stand in a nearer relation to you, than as\na niece?--I know she does! I know she does! And I embraced him as he\nstood.\n\n'Tis even so, my dear, replied he; and you remember my sister's\ngood-natured hint of Miss Sally Godfrey? I do well, sir, answered I.\nBut this is Miss Goodwin. Her mother chose that name for her, said he,\nbecause she should not be called by her own.\n\nWell, said I, excuse me, sir; I must go and have a little prattle\nwith her. I'll send for her in again, replied he; and in she came in a\nmoment. I took her in my arms, and said, O my charming dear! will you\nlove me?--Will you let me be your aunt? Yes, madam, answered she, with\nall my heart! and I will love you dearly: But I mustn't love my uncle.\nWhy so? said he. Because, replied she, you would not speak to me at\nfirst! And because you would not let me call you uncle (for it seems she\nwas bid not, that I might not guess at her presently): and yet, said the\npretty dear, I had not seen you a great while, so I hadn't.\n\nWell, Pamela, said he, now can you allow me to love this little\ninnocent? Allow you, sir, replied I; you would be very barbarous, if you\ndid not; and I should be more so, if I did not further it all I could,\nand love the little lamb myself, for your sake and for her own sake; and\nin compassion to her poor mother, though unknown to me: And tears stood\nin my eyes.\n\nSaid he, Why, my love, are your words so kind, and your countenance so\nsad?--I drew to the window from the child; and said, Sad it is not, sir;\nbut I have a strange grief and pleasure mingled at once in my breast, on\nthis occasion. It is indeed a twofold grief, and a twofold pleasure.--As\nhow, my dear? said he. Why, sir, replied I, I cannot help being grieved\nfor the poor mother of this sweet babe, to think, if she be living, that\nshe must call her chiefest delight her shame: If she be no more, that\nshe must have had such remorse on her poor mind, when she came to leave\nthe world, and her little babe: And, in the second place, I grieve, that\nit must be thought a kindness to the dear little soul, not to let\nher know how near the dearest relation she has in the world is to\nher.--Forgive me, dear sir, I say not this to reproach you, in the\nleast. Indeed I don't. And I have a twofold cause of joy; first, That\nI have had the grace to escape the like unhappiness with this poor\ngentlewoman: and next, That this discovery has given me an opportunity\nto shew the sincerity of my grateful affection for you, sir, in the love\nI will always express to this dear child.\n\nAnd then I stept to her again, and kissed her; and said, Join with me,\nmy pretty love, to beg your dear uncle to let you come and live with\nyour new aunt: Indeed, my little precious, I'll love you dearly.\n\nWill you, sir? said the little charmer; will you let me go and live with\nmy aunt?\n\nYou are very good, my Pamela, said he. And I have not once been deceived\nin the hopes my fond heart has entertained of your prudence.--But will\nyou, sir? said I; will you grant me this favour? I shall most sincerely\nlove the little charmer; and all I am capable of doing for her, both\nby example and affection, shall most cordially be done. My dearest sir,\nadded I, oblige me in this thing! I think already my heart is set upon\nit! What a sweet employment and companionship shall I have!\n\nWe'll talk of this some other time, replied he; but I must, in prudence,\nput some bounds to your amiable generosity. I had always intended to\nsurprise you into this discovery; but my sister led the way to it, out\nof a poorness in her spite, that I could not brook: And though you have\npleased me beyond expression, in your behaviour on this occasion; yet\nI can't say, that you have gone much beyond my expectations; for I have\nsuch a high opinion of you, that I think nothing could have shaken\nit, but a contrary conduct to this you have expressed on so tender a\ncircumstance.\n\nWell, sir, said the dear little miss, then you will not let me go home\nwith my aunt, will you? I am sure she will love me. When you break up\nnext, my dear, said he, if you are a good girl, you shall pay your new\naunt a visit. She made a low courtesy. Thank you, sir, answered she.\nYes, my dear, said I, and I will get you some fine things against the\ntime. I would have brought you some now, had I known I should have seen\nmy pretty love. Thank you, madam, returned she.\n\nHow old, sir, said I, is miss? Between six and seven, answered he. Was\nshe ever, sir, said I, at your house? My sister, replied he, carried her\nthither once, as a near relation of her lord's. I remember, sir, said I,\na little miss; and Mrs. Jervis and I took her to be a relation of Lord\nDavers.\n\nMy sister, returned he, knew the whole secret from the beginning; and it\nmade her a great merit with me, that she kept it from the knowledge\nof my father, who was then living, and of my mother, to her dying-day;\nthough she descended so low in her rage, to hint the matter to you.\n\nThe little misses took their leaves soon after: and I know not how, but\nI am strangely affected with this dear child. I wish he would be so good\nas to let me have her home. It would be a great pleasure to have such\na fine opportunity, obliged as I am, to shew my love for himself, in my\nfondness for his dear miss.\n\nAs we came home together in the chariot, he gave me the following\nparticulars of this affair, additional to what he had before mentioned:\n\nThat this lady was of a good family, and the flower of it but that her\nmother was a person of great art and address, and not altogether so nice\nin the particular between himself and miss, as she ought to have been:\nThat, particularly, when she had reason to find him unsettled and wild,\nand her daughter in more danger from him, than he was from her, yet she\nencouraged their privacies; and even, at last, when she had reason\nto apprehend, from their being surprised together, in a way not so\ncreditable to the lady, that she was far from forbidding their private\nmeetings; on the contrary, that, on a certain time, she had set one that\nhad formerly been her footman, and a half-pay officer, her relation, to\nwatch an opportunity, and to frighten him into a marriage with the lady:\nThat, accordingly, when they had surprised him in her chamber, just\nas he had been let in, they drew their swords upon him, and threatened\ninstantly to kill him, if he did not promise marriage on the spot; and\nthat they had a parson ready below stairs, as he found afterwards: That\nthen he suspected, from some strong circumstances, that miss was in the\nplot; which so enraged him, with their menaces together, that he drew,\nand stood upon his defence; and was so much in earnest, that the man he\npushed into the arm, and disabled; and pressing pretty forward upon\nthe other, as he retreated, he rushed in upon him near the top of the\nstairs, and pushed him down one pair, and he was much hurt by the fall:\nNot but that, he said, he might have paid for his rashness; but that\nthe business of his antagonists was rather to frighten than to kill\nhim: That, upon this, in the sight of the old lady, the parson she had\nprovided, and her other daughters, he went out of their house, with\nbitter execrations against them all.\n\nThat after this, designing to break off all correspondence with the\nwhole family, and miss too, she found means to engage him to give her\na meeting at Woodstock, in order to clear herself: That, poor lady! she\nwas there obliged, naughty creature as he was! to make herself quite\nguilty of a worse fault, in order to clear herself of a lighter:\nThat they afterwards met at Godstow often, at Woodstock, and every\nneighbouring place to Oxford, where he was then studying, as it proved,\nguilty lessons, instead of improving ones; till, at last, the effect\nof their frequent interviews grew too obvious to be concealed: That the\nyoung lady then, when she was not fit to be seen, for the credit of the\nfamily, was confined, and all manner of means were used, to induce him\nto marry her: That, finding nothing would do, they at last resolved\nto complain to his father and mother; but that he made his sister\nacquainted with the matter, who then happened to be at home; and, by her\nmanagement and spirit, their intentions of that sort were frustrated;\nand, seeing no hopes, they agreed to Lady Davers's proposals, and sent\npoor miss down to Marlborough, where, at her expense, which he answered\nto her again, she was provided for, and privately lay-in: That Lady\nDavers took upon herself the care of the little one, till it came to be\nfit to be put to the boarding-school, where it now is: And that he had\nsettled upon the dear little miss such a sum of money, as the interest\nof it would handsomely provide for her: and the principal would be\na tolerable fortune, fit for a gentlewoman, when she came to be\nmarriageable. And this, my dear, said he, is the story in brief. And\nI do assure you, Pamela, added he, I am far from making a boast of, or\ntaking a pride in, this affair: But since it has happened, I can't say\nbut I wish the poor child to live, and be happy; and I must endeavour to\nmake her so.\n\nSir, said I, to be sure you should; and I shall take a very great pride\nto contribute to the dear little soul's felicity, if you will permit me\nto have her home.--But, added I, does miss know any thing who are her\nfather and mother? I wanted him to say if the poor lady was living or\ndead.--No, answered he. Her governess has been told, by my sister, that\nshe is the daughter of a gentleman and his lady, who are related, at\na distance, to Lord Davers, and now live in Jamaica; and she calls me\nuncle, only because I am the brother to Lady Davers, whom she calls\naunt, and who is very fond of her: as is also my lord, who knows the\nwhole matter; and they have her, at all her little school recesses, at\ntheir house, and are very kind to her.\n\nI believe, added he, the truth of the matter is very little known\nor suspected; for, as her mother is of no mean family, her friends\nendeavour to keep it secret, as much as I: and Lady Davers, till her\nwrath boiled over, t'other day, has managed the matter very dexterously\nand kindly.\n\nThe words, mother is of no mean family, gave me not to doubt the poor\nlady was living. And I said, But how, sir, can the dear miss's poor\nmother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child?\nAh, Pamela, replied he, now you come in; I see you want to know what's\nbecome of the poor mother. 'Tis natural enough you should; but I was\nwilling to see how the little suspense would operate upon you.--Dear\nsir, said I.--Nay, replied he, 'tis very natural, my dear! I think you\nhave had a great deal of patience, and are come at this question so\nfairly that you deserve to be answered.\n\nYou must know then, there is some foundation for saying, that her\nmother, at least, lives in Jamaica; for there she does live, and very\nhappily too. For I must observe, that she suffered so much in child-bed,\nthat nobody expected her life; and this, when she was up, made such an\nimpression upon her, that she dreaded nothing so much as the thoughts of\nreturning to her former fault; and, to say the truth, I had intended to\nmake her a visit as soon as her month was well up. And so, unknown to\nme, she engaged herself to go to Jamaica, with two young ladies, who\nwere born there; and were returning to their friends, after they had\nbeen four years in England for their education: and, recommending to me,\nby a very moving letter, her little baby, and that I would not suffer it\nto be called by her name, but Goodwin, that her shame might be the less\nknown, for hers and her family's sake; she got her friends to assign\nher five hundred pounds, in full of all her demands upon her family, and\nwent up to London, and embarked, with her companions, at Gravesend,\nand so sailed to Jamaica; where she is since well and happily married,\npassing to her husband for a young widow, with one daughter, which her\nhusband's friends take care of, and provide for. And so you see, Pamela,\nthat in the whole story on both sides, the truth is as much preserved as\npossible.\n\nPoor lady! said I; how her story moves me! I am glad she is so happy\nat last!--And, my dear, said he, are you not glad she is so far off\ntoo?--As to that, sir, said I, I cannot be sorry, to be sure, as she\nis so happy; which she could not have been here. For, sir, I doubt you\nwould have proceeded with your temptations, if she had not gone; and\nit shewed she was much in earnest to be good, that she could leave her\nnative country, leave all her relations, leave you, whom she so well\nloved, leave her dear baby, and try a new fortune, in a new world, among\nquite strangers, and hazard the seas; and all to preserve herself from\nfurther guiltiness! Indeed, indeed, sir, said I, I bleed for what\nher distresses must be, in this case I am grieved for her poor mind's\nremorse, through her childbed terrors, which could have so great and so\nworthy an effect upon her afterwards; and I honour her resolution; and\nwould rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are\nmost virtuous; and doubt not God Almighty's mercy to her; and that her\npresent happiness is the result of his gracious providence, blessing her\npenitence and reformation.--But, sir, said I, did you not once see the\npoor lady after her lying-in?\n\nI did not believe her so much in earnest, answered he; and I went down\nto Marlborough, and heard she was gone from thence to Calne. I went to\nCalne, and heard she was gone to Reading, to a relation's there. Thither\nI went, and heard she was gone to Oxford. I followed; and there she was;\nbut I could not see her.\n\nShe at last received a letter from me, begging a meeting with her; for\nI found her departure with the ladies was resolved on, and that she was\nwith her friends, only to take leave of them, and receive her agreed\non portion: And she appointed the Saturday following, and that was\nWednesday, to give me a meeting at the old place, at Woodstock.\n\nThen, added he, I thought I was sure of her, and doubted not I should\nspoil her intended voyage. I set out on Thursday to Gloucester, on a\nparty of pleasure; and on Saturday I went to the place appointed, at\nWoodstock: But when I came thither, I found a letter instead of my\nlady; and when I opened it, it was to beg my pardon for deceiving me;\nexpressing her concern for her past fault; her affection for me; and\nthe apprehension she had, that she should be unable to keep her good\nresolves, if she met me: that she had set out on the Thursday for her\nembarkation; for that she feared nothing else could save her; and had\nappointed this meeting on Saturday, at the place of her former guilt,\nthat I might be suitably impressed upon the occasion, and pity and allow\nfor her; and that she might get three or four days start of me, and be\nquite out of my reach. She recommended again, as upon the spot where the\npoor little one owed its being, my tenderness to it, for her sake; and\nthat was all she had to request of me, she said; but would not forget\nto pray for me in all her own dangers, and in every difficulty she was\ngoing to encounter.\n\nI wept at this moving tale. And did not this make a deep impression upon\nyou, sir? said I. Surely such an affecting lesson as this, on the very\nguilty spot too, (I admire the dear lady's pious contrivance!) must have\nhad a great effect upon you. One would have thought, sir, it was enough\nto reclaim you for ever! All your naughty purposes, I make no doubt,\nwere quite changed?\n\nWhy, my dear, said he, I was much moved, you may be sure, when I came to\nreflect: But, at first, I was so assured of being a successful tempter,\nand spoiling her voyage, that I was vexed, and much out of humour;\nbut when I came to reflect, as I said, I was quite overcome with this\ninstance of her prudence, her penitence, and her resolution; and more\nadmired her than I ever had done. Yet I could not bear she should so\nescape me neither; so much overcome me, as it were, in an heroical\nbravery; and I hastened away, and got a bill of credit of Lord Davers,\nupon his banker in London, for five hundred pounds; and set out for that\nplace, having called at Oxford, and got what light I could, as to where\nI might hear of her there.\n\nWhen I arrived in town, which was not till Monday morning, I went to a\nplace called Crosby-square, where the friends of the two ladies lived.\nShe had set out in the flying-coach on Tuesday; got to the two ladies\nthat very night; and, on Saturday, had set out with them for Gravesend,\nmuch about the time I was expecting her at Woodstock.\n\nYou may suppose that I was much affected, my dear, with this. However,\nI got my bill of credit converted into money; and I set out with my\nservant on Monday afternoon, and reached Gravesend that night; and there\nI understood that she and the two ladies had gone on board from the very\ninn I put up at, in the morning; and the ship waited only for the wind,\nwhich then was turning about in its favour.\n\nI got a boat directly, and went on board the ship, and asked for Mrs.\nGodfrey. But judge you, my dear Pamela, her surprise and confusion, when\nshe saw me! She had like to have fainted away. I offered any money to\nput off the sailing till next day, but it would not be complied with;\nand fain would I have got her on shore, and promised to attend her, if\nshe would go over land, to any part of England the ship would touch at.\nBut she was immovable.\n\nEvery one concluded me her humble servant, and were touched at the\nmoving interview; the young ladies, and their female attendants,\nespecially. With great difficulty, upon my solemn assurances of honour,\nshe trusted herself with me in one of the cabins; and there I tried,\nwhat I could, to prevail upon her to quit her purpose; but all in\nvain: She said, I had made her quite unhappy by this interview! She had\ndifficulties enough upon her mind before; but now I had embittered all\nher voyage, and given her the deepest distress.\n\nI could prevail upon her but for one favour, and that with the greatest\nreluctance; which was, to accept of the five hundred pounds, as a\npresent from me; and she promised, at my earnest desire, to draw upon\nme for a greater sum, as a person that had her effects in my hands, when\nshe arrived, if she should find it convenient for her. In short, this\nwas all the favour I could procure; for she would not promise so much as\nto correspond with me, and was determined on going: and, I believe, if\nI would have married her, which yet I had not in my head, she would not\nhave deviated from her purpose.\n\nBut how, sir, said I, did you part? I would have sailed with her,\nanswered he, and been landed at the first port in England or Ireland,\nI cared not which, they should put in at; but she was too full of\napprehensions to admit it; And the rough fellow of a master, captain\nthey called him, (but, in my mind, I could have thrown him overboard,)\nwould not stay a moment, the wind and tide being quite fair; and was\nvery urgent with me to go a-shore, or to go the voyage; and being\nimpetuous in my temper, (spoiled, you know, my dear, by my mother,) and\nnot used to control, I thought it very strange that wind or tide, or any\nthing else, should be preferred to me and my money: But so it was; I was\nforced to go; and so took leave of the ladies, and the other passengers;\nwished them a good voyage; gave five guineas among the ship's crew, to\nbe good to the ladies, and took such a leave as you may better imagine\nthan I express. She recommended once more to me, the dear guest, as\nshe called her, the ladies being present; and thanked me for all these\ninstances of my regard, which, she said, would leave a strong impression\non her mind; and, at parting, she threw her arms about my neck, and\nwe took such a leave, as affected every one present, men, as well as\nladies.\n\nSo, with a truly heavy heart, I went down the ship's side to my boat;\nand stood up in it, looking at her, as long as I could see her, and she\nat me, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and then I gazed at the ship,\ntill, and after I had landed, as long as I could discern the least\nappearance of it; for she was under sail, in a manner, when I left her;\nand so I returned highly disturbed to my inn.\n\nI went to bed, but rested not; returned to London the next morning; and\nset out that afternoon again for the country. And so much, my dear, for\npoor Sally Godfrey.--She sends, I understand, by all opportunities,\nwith the knowledge of her husband, to learn how her child, by her first\nhusband, does; and has the satisfaction to know she is happily provided\nfor. And, about half a year ago, her spouse sent a little negro boy, of\nabout ten years old, as a present, to wait upon her. But he was taken\nill of the small-pox, and died in a month after he was landed.\n\nSure, sir, said I, your generous mind must have been long affected with\nthis melancholy case, and all its circumstances.\n\nIt hung upon me, indeed, some time, said he; but I was full of spirit\nand inconsideration. I went soon after to travel; a hundred new objects\ndanced before my eyes, and kept reflection from me. And, you see, I had\nfive or six years afterwards, and even before that, so thoroughly lost\nall the impressions you talk of, that I doubted not to make my Pamela\nchange her name, without either act of parliament, or wedlock, and be\nSally Godfrey the second.\n\nO you dear naughty man! said I, this seems but too true! but I bless God\nthat it is not so!--I bless God for your reformation, and that for your\nown dear sake, as well as mine!\n\nWell, my dear, said he, and I bless God for it too!--I do most\nsincerely!--And 'tis my greater pleasure, because I have, as I hoped,\nseen my error so early; and that with such a stock of youth and health\non my side, in all appearance, I can truly abhor my past liberties, and\npity poor Sally Godfrey, from the same motives that I admire my Pamela's\nvirtues; and resolve to make myself as worthy of them as possible: And\nI will hope, my dear, your prayers for my pardon, and my perseverance,\nwill be of no small efficacy on this occasion.\n\nThese agreeable reflections, on this melancholy but instructive story,\nbrought us in view of his own house; and we alighted, and took a walk\nin the garden till dinner was ready. And now we are so busy about making\nready for our appearance, that I shall hardly have time to write till\nthat be over.\n\n\nMonday morning.\n\nYesterday we set out, attended by John, Abraham, Benjamin, and Isaac, in\nfine new liveries, in the best chariot, which had been new cleaned, and\nlined, and new harnessed; so that it looked like a quite new one. But\nI had no arms to quarter with my dear lord and master's; though he\njocularly, upon my taking notice of my obscurity, said, that he had a\ngood mind to have the olive-branch, which would allude to his hopes,\nquartered for mine. I was dressed in the suit I mentioned, of white\nflowered with silver, and a rich head-dress, and the diamond necklace,\near-rings, etc. I also mentioned before: And my dear sir, in a fine\nlaced silk waistcoat, of blue paduasoy, and his coat a pearl-coloured\nfine cloth, with gold buttons and button-holes, and lined with white\nsilk; and he looked charmingly indeed. I said, I was too fine, and would\nhave laid aside some of the jewels; but he said, It would be thought\na slight to me from him, as his wife; and though as I apprehended,\nit might be, that people would talk as it was, yet he had rather they\nshould say any thing, than that I was not put upon an equal footing, as\nhis wife, with any lady he might have married.\n\nIt seems the neighbouring gentry had expected us; and there was a great\ncongregation; for (against my wish) we were a little of the latest; so\nthat, as we walked up the church to his seat, we had abundance of gazers\nand whisperers: But my dear master behaved with so intrepid an air, and\nwas so cheerful and complaisant to me, that he did credit to his kind\nchoice, instead of shewing as if he was ashamed of it: And as I was\nresolved to busy my mind entirely with the duties of the day, my\nintentness on that occasion, and my thankfulness to God, for his\nunspeakable mercies to me, so took up my thoughts, that I was much\nless concerned, than I should otherwise have been, at the gazings and\nwhisperings of the ladies and gentlemen, as well as of the rest of the\ncongregation, whose eyes were all turned to our seat.\n\nWhen the sermon was ended, we staid the longer, because the church\nshould be pretty empty; but we found great numbers at the church-doors,\nand in the church-porch; and I had the pleasure of hearing many\ncommendations, as well of my person, as my dress and behaviour, and not\none reflection, or mark of disrespect. Mr. Martin, who is single, Mr.\nChambers, Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Brooks, with their families, were all\nthere: And the four gentlemen came up to us, before we went into the\nchariot, and, in a very kind and respectful manner, complimented us\nboth: and Mrs. Arthur and Mrs. Brooks were so kind as to wish me joy;\nand Mrs. Brooks said, You sent Mr. Brooks, madam, home t'other day,\nquite charmed with a manner, which, you have convinced a thousand\npersons this day, is natural to you.\n\nYou do me great honour, madam, replied I. Such a good lady's approbation\nmust make me too sensible of my happiness. My dear master handed me into\nthe chariot, and stood talking with Sir Thomas Atkyns, at the door\nof it, (who was making him abundance of compliments, and is a very\nceremonious gentleman, a little too extreme in that way,) and, I\nbelieve, to familiarize me to the gazers, which concerned me a little;\nfor I was dashed to hear the praises of the countrypeople, and to\nsee how they crowded about the chariot. Several poor people begged\nmy charity, and I beckoned John with my fan, and said, Divide in\nthe further church-porch, that money to the poor, and let them come\nto-morrow morning to me, and I will give them something more, if they\ndon't importune me now. So I gave him all the silver I had, which\nhappened to be between twenty and thirty shillings; and this drew away\nfrom me their clamorous prayers for charity.\n\nMr. Martin came up to me on the other side of the chariot, and leaned on\nthe very door, while my master was talking to Sir Thomas, from whom he\ncould not get away; and said, By all that's good, you have charmed the\nwhole congregation! Not a soul but is full of your praises! My neighbour\nknew, better than any body could tell him, how to choose for himself.\nWhy, said he, the dean himself looked more upon you than his book.\n\nO sir, said I, you are very encouraging to a weak mind! I vow, said\nhe, I say no more than is truth: I'd marry to-morrow, if I was sure\nof meeting with a person of but one-half the merit you have. You are,\ncontinued he, and 'tis not my way to praise too much, an ornament to\nyour sex, an honour to your spouse, and a credit to religion.--Every\nbody is saying so, added he; for you have, by your piety, edified the\nwhole church.\n\nAs he had done speaking, the dean himself complimented me, that\nthe behaviour of so worthy a lady, would be very edifying to his\ncongregation, and encouraging to himself. Sir, said I, you are very\nkind: I hope I shall not behave unworthy of the good instructions I\nshall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine. He bowed,\nand went on.\n\nSir Thomas then applied to me, my master stepping into the chariot, and\nsaid, I beg pardon, madam, for detaining your good spouse from you: but\nI have been saying, he is the happiest man in the world. I bowed to him,\nbut I could have wished him further, to make me sit so in the notice of\nevery one; which, for all I could do, dashed me not a little. Mr. Martin\nsaid to my master, If you'll come to church every Sunday with your\ncharming lady, I will never absent myself, and she'll give a good\nexample to all the neighbourhood. O, my dear sir! said I to my master,\nyou know not how much I am obliged to good Mr. Martin! He has, by his\nkind expressions, made me dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude.\n\nSaid my master, My dear love, I am very much obliged, as well as you, to\nmy good friend Mr. Martin. And he said to him, We will constantly go\nto church, and to every other place, where we can have the pleasure of\nseeing Mr. Martin.\n\nMr. Martin said, Gad, sir, you are a happy man; and I think your lady's\nexample has made you more polite and handsome too, than I ever knew you\nbefore, though we never thought you unpolite, neither. And so he bowed,\nand went to his own chariot; and, as we drove away, the people kindly\nblessed us, and called us a charming pair.\n\nAs I have no other pride, I hope, in repeating these things, than in\nthe countenance the general approbation gives to my dear master, for his\nstooping so low, you will excuse me for it, I know.\n\nIn the afternoon we went again to church, and a little early, at my\nrequest; but the church was quite full, and soon after even crowded; so\nmuch does novelty (the more's the pity!) attract the eyes of mankind.\nMr. Martin came in after us, and made up to our seat; and said, If you\nplease, my dear friend, I will take my seat with you this afternoon.\nWith all my heart, said my master. I was sorry for it; but was\nresolved my duty should not be made second to bashfulness, or any other\nconsideration; and when divine service began, I withdrew to the farther\nend of the pew, and left the gentlemen in the front, and they behaved\nquite suitably, both of them, to the occasion. I mention this the\nrather, because Mr. Martin was not very noted for coming to church, or\nattention when there, before.\n\nThe dean preached again, which he was not used to do, out of compliment\nto us; and an excellent sermon he made on the relative duties of\nChristianity: And it took my particular attention; for he made many\nfine observations on the subject. Mr. Martin addressed himself twice or\nthrice to me, during the sermon; but he saw me so wholly engrossed with\nhearkening to the good preacher, that he forbore interrupting me; yet I\ntook care, according to the lessons formerly given me, to observe to\nhim a cheerful and obliging behaviour, as one of Mr. B----'s friends and\nintimates. My master asked him to give him his company to supper; and he\nsaid, I am so taken with your lady, that you must not give me too much\nencouragement; for I shall be always with you, if you do. He was pleased\nto say, You cannot favour us with too much of your company; and as I\nhave left you in the lurch in your single state, I think you will do\nwell to oblige us as much as you can; and who knows but my happiness may\nreform another rake? Who knows? said Mr. Martin: Why, I know; for I am\nmore than half reformed already.\n\nAt the chariot door, Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. Brooks, and Mrs. Chambers, were\nbrought to me, by their respective spouses; and presently the witty Lady\nTowers, who bantered me before, (as I once told you,) joined them; and\nMrs. Arthur said, she wished me joy; and that all the good ladies, my\nneighbours, would collect themselves together, and make me a visit.\nThis, said I, will be an honour, madam, that I can never enough\nacknowledge. It will be very kind so to countenance a person who will\nalways study to deserve your favour, by the most respectful behaviour.\n\nLady Towers said, My dear neighbour, you want no countenance; your own\nmerit is sufficient. I had a slight cold, that kept me at home in the\nmorning; but I heard you so much talked of, and praised, that I resolved\nnot to stay away in the afternoon; and I join in the joy every one gives\nyou. She turned to my master, and said, You are a sly thief, as I always\nthought you. Where have you stolen this lady? And now, how barbarous is\nit, thus unawares, in a manner, to bring her here upon us, to mortify\nand eclipse us all?--You are very kind, madam, said he, that you and all\nmy worthy neighbours see with my eyes. But had I not known she had so\nmuch excellency of mind and behaviour, as would strike every body in her\nfavour at first sight, I should not have dared to class her with such of\nmy worthy neighbours, as now so kindly congratulate us both.\n\nI own, said she, softly, I was one of your censurers; but I never liked\nyou so well in my life, as for this action, now I see how capable your\nbride is of giving distinction to any condition.--And, coming to me, My\ndear neighbour, said she, excuse me for having but in my thought, the\nremembrance that I have seen you formerly, when, by your sweet air and\neasy deportment, you so much surpass us all, and give credit to your\npresent happy condition.\n\nDear good madam, said I, how shall I suitably return my acknowledgments!\nBut it will never be a pain to me to look back upon my former days,\nnow I have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy ladies to\nsupport me in the honours to which the most generous of men has raised\nme.\n\nSweetly said! she was pleased to say. If I was in another place, I would\nkiss you for that answer. Oh! happy, happy Mr. B----! said she to my\nmaster; what reputation have you not brought upon your judgment! I\nwon't be long before I see you, added she, I'll assure you, if I come by\nmyself. That shall be your own fault, madam, said Mrs. Brooks.\n\nAnd so they took leave; and I gave my hand to my dear master, and said,\nHow happy have you made me, generous sir!--And the dean, who had just\ncome up, heard me, and said, And how happy you have made your spouse,\nI'll venture to pronounce, is hard to say, from what I observe of you\nboth. I courtesied, and blushed, not thinking any body heard me. And my\nmaster telling him he should be glad of the honour of a visit from him;\nhe said, He would pay his respects to us the first opportunity, and\nbring his wife and daughter to attend me. I said, That was doubly kind;\nand I should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an acquaintance. I\nthanked him for his kind discourse; and he thanked me for my attention,\nwhich he called exemplary: and so my dear master handed me into the\nchariot; and we were carried home, both happy, and both pleased, thank\nGod.\n\nMr. Martin came in the evening, with another gentleman, his friend, one\nMr. Dormer; and he entertained us with the favourable opinion, he said,\nevery one had of me, and of the choice my good benefactor had made.\n\nThis morning the poor came, according to my invitation; and I sent them\naway with glad hearts to the number of twenty-five. There were not above\ntwelve or fourteen on Sunday, that John divided the silver among, which\nI gave him for that purpose; but others got hold of the matter, and made\nup to the above number.\n\n\nTuesday.\n\nMy generous master has given me, this morning, a most considerate, but\nyet, from the nature of it, melancholy instance of his great regard for\nmy unworthiness, which I never could have wished, hoped for, or even\nthought of.\n\nHe took a walk with me, after breakfast, into the garden; and a little\nshower falling, he led me, for shelter, into the little summer-house,\nin the private garden, where he formerly gave me apprehensions; and,\nsitting down by me, he said, I have now finished all that lies on my\nmind, my dear, and am very easy: For have you not wondered, that I have\nso much employed myself in my library? Been so much at home, and yet not\nin your company?--No, sir, said I; I have never been so impertinent as\nto wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about; nor would\ngive way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you: And, besides,\nI know your large possessions; and the method you take of looking\nyourself into your affairs, must needs take up so much of your time,\nthat I ought to be very careful how I intrude upon you.\n\nWell, said he, but I'll tell you what has been my last work I have taken\nit into my consideration, that, at present, my line is almost extinct;\nand that the chief part of my maternal estate, in case I die without\nissue, will go to another line, and great part of my personal will fall\ninto such hands, as I shall not care my Pamela should be at the\nmercy of. I have, therefore, as human life is uncertain, made such a\ndisposition of my affairs, as will make you absolutely independent and\nhappy; as will secure to you the power of doing a great deal of good,\nand living as a person ought to do, who is my relict; and shall put\nit out of any body's power to molest your father and mother, in the\nprovision I design them, for the remainder of their days: And I have\nfinished all this very morning, except to naming trustees for you; and\nif you have any body you would confide in more than another, I would\nhave you speak.\n\nI was so touched with this mournful instance of his excessive goodness\nto me, and the thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn occasion,\nthat I was unable to speak; and at last relieved my mind by a violent\nfit of weeping; and could only say, clasping my arms around the dear\ngenerous man, How shall I support this! So very cruel, yet so very kind!\n\nDon't, my dear, said he, be concerned at what gives me pleasure. I am\nnot the nearer my end, for having made this disposition; but I think\nthe putting off these material points, when so many accidents every day\nhappen, and life is so precarious, is one of the most inexcusable things\nin the world. And there are many important points to be thought of, when\nlife is drawing to its utmost verge; and the mind may be so agitated\nand unfit, that it is a most sad thing to put off, to that time, any of\nthose concerns, which more especially require a considerate and composed\nframe of temper, and perfect health and vigour, to give directions\nabout. My poor friend, Mr. Carlton, who died in my arms so lately; and\nhad a mind disturbed by worldly considerations on one side; a weakness\nof body, through the violence of his distemper, on another; and the\nconcerns of still as much more moment, as the soul is to the body, on\na third; made so great an impression upon me then, that I was the more\nimpatient to come to this house, where were most of my writings, in\norder to make the disposition I have now perfected: And since it is\ngrievous to my dear girl, I will myself think of such trustees as shall\nbe most for her benefit. I have only, therefore, to assure you, my dear,\nthat in this instance, as I will do in any other I can think of, I have\nstudied to make you quite easy, free, and independent. And because I\nshall avoid all occasions, for the future, which may discompose you, I\nhave but one request to make; which is, that if it please God, for my\nsins, to separate me from my dearest Pamela, you will only resolve not\nto marry one person; for I would not be such a Herod, as to restrain\nyou from a change of condition with any other, however reluctantly I may\nthink of any other person's succeeding me in your esteem.\n\nI could not answer, and thought my heart would have burst: And he\ncontinued, To conclude at once a subject that is so grievous to you, I\nwill tell you, my Pamela, that this person is Mr. Williams. And now I\nwill acquaint you with my motive for this request; which is wholly owing\nto my niceness, and to no dislike I have for him, or apprehension of any\nlikelihood that it will be so: but, methinks it would reflect a little\nupon my Pamela, if she was to give way to such a conduct, as if she had\nmarried a man for his estate, when she had rather have had another,\nhad it not been for that; and that now, the world will say, she is at\nliberty to pursue her inclination, the parson is the man!--And I cannot\nbear even the most distant apprehension, that I had not the preference\nwith you, of any man living, let me have been what I would, as I\nhave shewn my dear life, that I have preferred her to all her sex, of\nwhatever degree.\n\nI could not speak, might I have had the world; and he took me in his\narms, and said, I have now spoken all my mind, and expect no answer; and\nI see you too much moved to give me one. Only forgive me the mention,\nsince I have told you my motive; which as much affects your reputation,\nas my niceness; and offer not at an answer;--only say, you forgive me:\nAnd I hope I have not one discomposing thing to say to my dearest, for\nthe rest of my life; which I pray God, for both our sakes, to lengthen\nfor many happy years.\n\nGrief still choaked up the passage of my words; and he said, The shower\nis over, my dear: let us walk out again.--He led me out, and I would\nhave spoken; but he said, I will not hear my dear creature say any\nthing! To hearken to your assurance of complying with my request, would\nlook as if I doubted you, and wanted it. I am confident I needed only\nto speak my mind, to be observed by you; and I shall never more think on\nthe subject, if you don't remind me of it. He then most sweetly changed\nthe discourse.\n\nDon't you with pleasure, my dear, said he, take in the delightful\nfragrance that this sweet shower has given to these banks of flowers?\nYour presence is so enlivening to me, that I could almost fancy, that\nwhat we owe to the shower, is owing to that: And all nature, methinks,\nblooms around me when I have my Pamela by my side. You are a poetess,\nmy dear; and I will give you a few lines, that I made myself on such an\noccasion as this I am speaking of, the presence of a sweet companion,\nand the fresh verdure, that, after a shower, succeeding a long drought,\nshewed itself throughout all vegetable nature. And then, in a sweet and\neasy accent, (with his dear arms about me as we walked,) he sung me the\nfollowing verses; of which he afterwards favoured me with a copy:\n\n\n                  I.\n\n    All nature blooms when you appear;\n    The fields their richest liv'ries wear;\n    Oaks, elms, and pines, blest with your view,\n    Shoot out fresh greens, and bud anew.\n      The varying seasons you supply;\n      And, when you're gone, they fade and die.\n\n                 II.\n\n    Sweet Philomel, in mournful strains,\n    To you appeals, to you complains.\n    The tow'ring lark, on rising wing,\n    Warbles to you, your praise does sing;\n      He cuts the yielding air, and flies\n      To heav'n, to type your future joys.\n\n                III.\n\n    The purple violet, damask rose,\n    Each, to delight your senses, blows.\n    The lilies ope', as you appear;\n    And all the beauties of the year\n      Diffuse their odours at your feet,\n      Who give to ev'ry flow'r its sweet.\n\n                 IV.\n\n    For flow'rs and women are allied;\n    Both, nature's glory, and her pride!\n    Of ev'ry fragrant sweet possest,\n    They bloom but for the fair one's breast,\n      And to the swelling bosom borne,\n      Each other mutually adorn.\n\n\nThus sweetly did he palliate the woes, which the generosity of his\nactions, mixed with the solemness of the occasion, and the strange\nrequest he had vouchsafed to make me, had occasioned. And all he would\npermit me to say, was, that I was not displeased with him!--Displeased\nwith you, dearest sir! said I: Let me thus testify my obligations, and\nthe force all your commands shall have upon me. And I took the liberty\nto clasp my arms about his neck, and kissed him.\n\nBut yet my mind was pained at times, and has been to this hour.--God\ngrant that I may never see the dreadful moment, that shall shut up the\nprecious life of this excellent, generous benefactor of mine! And--but I\ncannot bear to suppose--I cannot say more on such a deep subject.\n\nOh! what a poor thing is human life in its best enjoyments! subjected to\nimaginary evils, when it has no real ones to disturb it; and that can\nbe made as effectually unhappy by its apprehensions of remote\ncontingencies, as if it was struggling with the pangs of a present\ndistress! This, duly reflected upon, methinks, should convince every\none, that this world is not a place for the immortal mind to be confined\nto; and that there must be an hereafter, where the whole soul shall be\nsatisfied.\n\nBut I shall get out of my depth; my shallow mind cannot comprehend,\nas it ought, these weighty subjects: Let me only therefore pray, that,\nafter having made a grateful use of God's mercies here, I may, with my\ndear benefactor, rejoice in that happy state, where is no mixture,\nno unsatisfiedness; and where all is joy, and peace, and love, for\nevermore!\n\nI said, when we sat at supper, The charming taste you gave me, sir, of\nyour poetical fancy, makes me sure you have more favours of this kind\nto delight me with, if you please; and may I beg to be indulged on this\nagreeable head? Hitherto, said he, my life has been too much a life of\ngayety and action, to be busied so innocently. Some little essays I have\nnow and then attempted; but very few have I completed. Indeed I had not\npatience nor attention enough to hold me long to any one thing. Now and\nthen, perhaps, I may occasionally shew you what I have essayed. But I\nnever could please myself in this way.\n\n\nFriday.\n\nWe were yesterday favoured with the company of almost all the\nneighbouring gentlemen and their ladies, who, by appointment with\none another, met to congratulate our happiness. Nothing could be more\nobliging, more free and affectionate, than the ladies; nothing more\npolite than the gentlemen. All was performed (for they came to supper)\nwith decency and order, and much to every one's satisfaction; which\nwas principally owing to good Mrs. Jervis's care and skill; who is an\nexcellent manager.\n\nFor my part, I was dressed out only to be admired, as it seems: and\ntruly, if I had not known, that I did not make myself, as you, my dear\nfather, once hinted to me, and if I had had the vanity to think as well\nof myself, as the good company was pleased to do, I might possibly have\nbeen proud. But I know, as my Lady Davers said, though in anger, yet in\ntruth, that I am but a poor bit of painted dirt. All that I value myself\nupon, is, that God has raised me to a condition to be useful, in my\ngeneration, to better persons than myself. This is my pride: And I hope\nthis will be all my pride. For what was I of myself!--All the good I can\ndo, is but a poor third-hand good; for my dearest master himself is but\nthe second-hand. God, the all-gracious, the all-good, the all-bountiful,\nthe all-mighty, the all-merciful God, is the first: To him, therefore,\nbe all the glory!\n\nAs I expect the happiness, the unspeakable happiness, my ever-dear and\never-honoured father and mother, of enjoying you both here, under this\nroof, so soon, (and pray let it be as soon as you can,) I will not enter\ninto the particulars of the last agreeable evening: For I shall have a\nthousand things, as well as that, to talk to you upon. I fear you will\nbe tired with my prattle when I see you!\n\nI am to return these visits singly; and there were eight ladies here of\ndifferent families. Dear heart! I shall find enough to do!--I doubt\nmy time will not be so well filled up, as I once promised my dear\nmaster!--But he is pleased, cheerful, kind, affectionate! O what a happy\ncreature am I!--May I be always thankful to God, and grateful to him!\n\nWhen all these tumultuous visitings are over, I shall have my mind, I\nhope, subside into a family calm, that I may make myself a little useful\nto the household of my dear master; or else I shall be an unprofitable\nservant indeed!\n\nLady Davers sent this morning her compliments to us both, very\naffectionately; and her lord's good wishes and congratulations: and she\ndesired my writings per bearer; and says, she will herself bring them\nto me again, with thanks, as soon as she has read them; and she and her\nlord will come and be my guests (that was her particularly kind word)\nfor a fortnight.\n\nI have now but one thing to wish for; and then, methinks, I shall be all\necstasy: and that is, your presence, both of you, and your blessings;\nwhich I hope you will bestow upon me every morning and night, till you\nare settled in the happy manner my dear Mr. B---- has intended.\n\nMethinks I want sadly your list of the honest and worthy poor; for the\nmoney lies by me, and brings me no interest. You see I am become a mere\nusurer; and want to make use upon use: and yet, when I have done all, I\ncannot do so much as I ought. God forgive my imperfections!\n\nI tell my dear spouse, I want another dairy-house visit. To be sure, if\nhe won't, at present, permit it, I shall, if it please God to spare us,\ntease him like any over-indulged wife, if, as the dear charmer grows\nolder, he won't let me have the pleasure of forming her tender mind, as\nwell as I am able; lest, poor little soul, she fall into such snares,\nas her unhappy dear mother fell into. I am providing a power of pretty\nthings for her, against I see her next, that I may make her love me, if\nI can.\n\nJust now I have the blessed news, that you will set out for this happy\nhouse on Tuesday morning. The chariot shall be with you without fail.\nGod give us a happy meeting! O how I long for it! Forgive your impatient\ndaughter, who sends this to amuse you on your journey; and desires to be\nEver most dutifully yours.\n\n\nHere end, at present, the letters of Pamela to her father and mother.\nThey arrived at their daughter's house on Tuesday evening in the\nfollowing week, and were received by her with the utmost joy and duty;\nand with great goodness and complaisance by Mr. B----. And having\nresided there till every thing was put in order for them at the Kentish\nestate, they were carried down thither by himself, and their daughter,\nand put into possession of the pretty farm he had designed for them.\n\nThe reader will here indulge us in a few brief observations, which\nnaturally result from the story and characters; and which will serve\nas so many applications of its most material incidents to the minds of\nYOUTH of BOTH SEXES.\n\nFirst, then, in the character of the GENTLEMAN, may be seen that of a\nfashionable libertine, who allowed himself in the free indulgence of his\npassions, especially to the fair sex; and found himself supported in\nhis daring attempts, by an affluent fortune in possession, a personal\nbravery, as it is called, readier to give than take offence, and an\nimperious will: yet as he betimes sees his errors, and reforms in the\nbloom of youth, an edifying lesson may be drawn from it, for the use\nof such as are born to large fortunes; and who may be taught, by his\nexample, the inexpressible difference between the hazards and remorse\nwhich attend a profligate course of life, and the pleasures which flow\nfrom virtuous love, and benevolent actions.\n\nIn the character of Lady DAVERS, let the proud, and the high-born, see\nthe deformity of unreasonable passion, and how weak and ridiculous such\npersons must appear, who suffer themselves, as is usually the case, to\nbe hurried from the height of violence, to the most abject submission;\nand subject themselves to be outdone by the humble virtue they so much\ndespise.\n\nLet good CLERGYMEN, in Mr. WILLIAMS, see, that whatever displeasure\nthe doing of their duty may give, for a time, to their proud patrons,\nProvidence will, at last, reward their piety, and turn their distresses\nto triumph; and make them even more valued for a conduct that gave\noffence while the violence of passion lasted, than if they had meanly\nstooped to flatter or soothe the vices of the great.\n\nIn the examples of good old ANDREWS and his WIFE, let those, who are\nreduced to a low estate, see, that Providence never fails to reward\ntheir honesty and integrity: and that God will, in his own good time,\nextricate them, by means unforeseen, out of their present difficulties,\nand reward them with benefits unhoped for.\n\nThe UPPER SERVANTS of great families may, from the odious character\nof Mrs. JEWKES, and the amiable ones of Mrs. JERVIS, Mr. LONGMAN, etc.\nlearn what to avoid, and what to choose, to make themselves valued and\nesteemed by all who know them.\n\nAnd, from the double conduct of poor JOHN, the LOWER SERVANTS may\nlearn fidelity, and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful\ncommands of a superior.\n\nThe poor deluded female, who, like the once unhappy Miss GODFREY, has\ngiven up her honour, and yielded to the allurements of her designing\nlover, may learn from her story, to stop at the first fault; and, by\nresolving to repent and amend, see the pardon and blessing which await\nher penitence, and a kind Providence ready to extend the arms of its\nmercy to receive and reward her returning duty: While the prostitute,\npursuing the wicked courses, into which, perhaps, she was at first\ninadvertently drawn, hurries herself into filthy diseases, and an\nuntimely death; and, too probably, into everlasting perdition.\n\nLet the desponding heart be comforted by the happy issue which the\ntroubles and trials of PAMELA met with, when they see, in her case,\nthat no danger nor distress, however inevitable, or deep to their\napprehensions, can be out of the power of Providence to obviate or\nrelieve; and which, as in various instances in her story, can turn\nthe most seemingly grievous things to its own glory, and the reward of\nsuffering innocence; and that too, at a time when all human prospects\nseem to fail.\n\nLet the rich, and those who are exalted from a low to a high estate,\nlearn from her, that they are not promoted only for a single good; but\nthat Providence has raised them, that they should dispense to all within\ntheir reach, the blessings it has heaped upon them; and that the greater\nthe power is to which God hath raised them, the greater is the good that\nwill be expected from them.\n\nFrom the low opinion she every where shews of herself, and her\nattributing all her excellencies to pious education, and her lady's\nvirtuous instructions and bounty; let persons, even of genius and piety,\nlearn not to arrogate to themselves those gifts and graces, which they\nowe least of all to themselves: Since the beauties of person are frail;\nand it is not in our power to give them to ourselves, or to be either\nprudent, wise, or good, without the assistance of divine grace.\n\nFrom the same good example, let children see what a blessing awaits\ntheir duty to their parents, though ever so low in the world; and that\nthe only disgrace, is to be dishonest; but none at all to be poor.\n\nFrom the economy she purposes to observe in her elevation, let even\nladies of condition learn, that there are family employments, in which\nthey may and ought to make themselves useful, and give good examples to\ntheir inferiors, as well as equals: and that their duty to God,\ncharity to the poor and sick, and the different branches of household\nmanagement, ought to take up the most considerable portions of their\ntime.\n\nFrom her signal veracity, which she never forfeited, in all the\nhardships she was tried with, though her answers, as she had reason to\napprehend, would often make against her; and the innocence she preserved\nthroughout all her stratagems and contrivances to save herself from\nviolation: Persons, even sorely tempted, may learn to preserve a sacred\nregard to truth; which always begets a reverence for them, even in the\ncorruptest minds.\n\n\n    In short,\n\n    Her obliging behaviour to her equals, before her exaltation; her\n      kindness to them afterwards; her forgiving spirit, and her\n      generosity;\n\n    Her meekness, in every circumstance where her virtue was not\n      concerned;\n\n    Her charitable allowances for others, as in the case of Miss\n      Godfrey, for faults she would not have forgiven in herself;\n\n    Her kindness and prudence to the offspring of that melancholy\n      adventure;\n\n    Her maiden and bridal purity, which extended as well to her\n      thoughts as to her words and actions;\n\n    Her signal affiance in God;\n\n    Her thankful spirit;\n\n    Her grateful heart;\n\n    Her diffusive charity to the poor, which made her blessed\n      by them whenever she appeared abroad;\n\n    The cheerful ease and freedom of her deportment;\n\n    Her parental, conjugal, and maternal duty;\n\n    Her social virtues;\n\n\nAre all so many signal instances of the excellency of her mind, which\nmay make her character worthy of the imitation of her sex. And the\nEditor of these sheets will have his end, if it inspires a laudable\nemulation in the minds of any worthy persons, who may thereby entitle\nthemselves to the rewards, the praises, and the blessings, by which\nPAMELA was so deservedly distinguished.\n\n\nTHE END", "title": "Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded"}
