Hargrave learns the Southern style of talking and anecdote.\nMajor Pendleton having spent their last two dollars on play tickets, Lydia is excited to see a play but is shocked to see Mr. Hargraves impersonating her father on stage. Back at their rooms, the Major scolds Hargraves, who offers an apologetic payment. The Major refuses, even though he and Lydia are almost destitute.\nJust when the father and daughter's situation is most bleak, an old colored man appears and tells the Talbots that he owes them money from an old family debt.

I have tried to keep a certain unity of aim and\nimpression in selecting these stories. In the first place I determined\nthat the pieces of brief fiction which I included must first of all be\nnot merely good stories, but good short stories. I put myself in the\nposition of one who was about to select the best short stories in the\nwhole range of American literature,[1] but who, just before he started\nto do this, was notified that he must refrain from selecting any of\nthe best American short stories that did not contain the element of\nhumor to a marked degree. But I have kept in mind the wide boundaries\nof the term humor, and also the fact that the humorous standard should\nbe kept second--although a close second--to the short story standard.\n\nIn view of the necessary limitations as to the volume's size, I could\nnot hope to represent all periods of American literature adequately,\nnor was this necessary in order to give examples of the best that has\nbeen done in the short story in a humorous vein in American\nliterature. Probably all types of the short story of humor are\nincluded here, at any rate. Not only copyright restrictions but in a\nmeasure my own opinion have combined to exclude anything by Joel\nChandler Harris--_Uncle Remus_--from the collection. Harris is\nprimarily--in his best work--a humorist, and only secondarily a short\nstory writer. As a humorist he is of the first rank; as a writer of\nshort stories his place is hardly so high. His humor is not mere\nfunniness and diversion; he is a humorist in the fundamental and large\nsense, as are Cervantes, Rabelais, and Mark Twain.\n\nNo book is duller than a book of jokes, for what is refreshing in\nsmall doses becomes nauseating when perused in large assignments.\nHumor in literature is at its best not when served merely by itself\nbut when presented along with other ingredients of literary force in\norder to give a wide representation of life. Therefore \"professional\nliterary humorists,\" as they may be called, have not been much\nconsidered in making up this collection. In the history of American\nhumor there are three names which stand out more prominently than all\nothers before Mark Twain, who, however, also belongs to a wider\nclassification: \"Josh Billings\" (Henry Wheeler Shaw, 1815-1885),\n\"Petroleum V. Nasby\" (David Ross Locke, 1833-1888), and \"Artemus Ward\"\n(Charles Farrar Browne, 1834-1867). In the history of American humor\nthese names rank high; in the field of American literature and the\nAmerican short story they do not rank so high. I have found nothing of\ntheirs that was first-class both as humor and as short story. Perhaps\njust below these three should be mentioned George Horatio Derby\n(1823-1861), author of _Phoenixiana_ (1855) and the _Squibob Papers_\n(1859), who wrote under the name \"John Phoenix.\" As has been justly\nsaid, \"Derby, Shaw, Locke and Browne carried to an extreme numerous\ntricks already invented by earlier American humorists, particularly\nthe tricks of gigantic exaggeration and calm-faced mendacity, but they\nare plainly in the main channel of American humor, which had its\norigin in the first comments of settlers upon the conditions of the\nfrontier, long drew its principal inspiration from the differences\nbetween that frontier and the more settled and compact regions of the\ncountry, and reached its highest development in Mark Twain, in his\nyouth a child of the American frontier, admirer and imitator of Derby\nand Browne, and eventually a man of the world and one of its greatest\nhumorists.\"[2] Nor have such later writers who were essentially\nhumorists as \"Bill Nye\" (Edgar Wilson Nye, 1850-1896) been considered,\nbecause their work does not attain the literary standard and the short\nstory standard as creditably as it does the humorous one. When we come\nto the close of the nineteenth century the work of such men as \"Mr.\nDooley\" (Finley Peter Dunne, 1867- ) and George Ade (1866- ) stands\nout. But while these two writers successfully conform to the exacting\ncritical requirements of good humor and--especially the former--of\ngood literature, neither--though Ade more so--attains to the greatest\nexcellence of the short story. Mr. Dooley of the Archey Road is\nessentially a wholesome and wide-poised humorous philosopher, and the\nauthor of _Fables in Slang_ is chiefly a satirist, whether in fable,\nplay or what not.\n\nThis volume might well have started with something by Washington\nIrving, I suppose many critics would say. It does not seem to me,\nhowever, that Irving's best short stories, such as _The Legend of\nSleepy Hollow_ and _Rip Van Winkle_, are essentially humorous stories,\nalthough they are o'erspread with the genial light of reminiscence. It\nis the armchair geniality of the eighteenth century essayists, a\nconstituent of the author rather than of his material and product.\nIrving's best humorous creations, indeed, are scarcely short stories\nat all, but rather essaylike sketches, or sketchlike essays. James\nLawson (1799-1880) in his _Tales and Sketches: by a Cosmopolite_\n(1830), notably in _The Dapper Gentleman's Story_, is also plainly a\nfollower of Irving. We come to a different vein in the work of such\nwriters as William Tappan Thompson (1812-1882), author of the amusing\nstories in letter form, _Major Jones's Courtship_ (1840); Johnson\nJones Hooper (1815-1862), author of _Widow Rugby's Husband, and Other\nTales of Alabama_ (1851); Joseph G. Baldwin (1815-1864), who wrote\n_The Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi_ (1853); and Augustus\nBaldwin Longstreet (1790-1870), whose _Georgia Scenes_ (1835) are as\nimportant in \"local color\" as they are racy in humor. Yet none of\nthese writers yield the excellent short story which is also a good\npiece of humorous literature. But they opened the way for the work of\nlater writers who did attain these combined excellences.\n\nThe sentimental vein of the midcentury is seen in the work of Seba\nSmith (1792-1868), Eliza Leslie (1787-1858), Frances Miriam Whitcher\n(\"Widow Bedott,\" 1811-1852), Mary W. Janvrin (1830-1870), and Alice\nBradley Haven Neal (1828-1863). The well-known work of Joseph Clay\nNeal (1807-1847) is so all pervaded with caricature and humor that it\nbelongs with the work of the professional humorist school rather than\nwith the short story writers. To mention his _Charcoal Sketches, or\nScenes in a Metropolis_ (1837-1849) must suffice. The work of Seba\nSmith is sufficiently expressed in his title, _Way Down East, or\nPortraitures of Yankee Life_ (1854), although his _Letters of Major\nJack Downing_ (1833) is better known. Of his single stories may be\nmentioned _The General Court and Jane Andrews' Firkin of Butter_\n(October, 1847, _Graham's Magazine_). The work of Frances Miriam\nWhitcher (\"Widow Bedott\") is of somewhat finer grain, both as humor\nand in other literary qualities. Her stories or sketches, such as\n_Aunt Magwire's Account of Parson Scrantum's Donation Party_ (March,\n1848, _Godey's Lady's Book_) and _Aunt Magwire's Account of the\nMission to Muffletegawmy_ (July, 1859, _Godey's_), were afterwards\ncollected in _The Widow Bedott Papers_ (1855-56-80). The scope of the\nwork of Mary B. Haven is sufficiently suggested by her story, _Mrs.\nBowen's Parlor and Spare Bedroom_ (February, 1860, _Godey's_), while\nthe best stories of Mary W. Janvrin include _The Foreign Count; or,\nHigh Art in Tattletown_ (October, 1860, _Godey's_) and _City\nRelations; or, the Newmans' Summer at Clovernook_ (November, 1861,\n_Godey's_). The work of Alice Bradley Haven Neal is of somewhat\nsimilar texture. Her book, _The Gossips of Rivertown, with Sketches in\nProse and Verse_ (1850) indicates her field, as does the single title,\n_The Third-Class Hotel_ (December, 1861, _Godey's_). Perhaps the most\nrepresentative figure of this school is Eliza Leslie (1787-1858), who\nas \"Miss Leslie\" was one of the most frequent contributors to the\nmagazines of the 1830's, 1840's and 1850's. One of her best stories is\n_The Watkinson Evening_ (December, 1846, _Godey's Lady's Book_),\nincluded in the present volume; others are _The Batson Cottage_\n(November, 1846, _Godey's Lady's Book_) and _Juliet Irwin; or, the\nCarriage People_ (June, 1847, _Godey's Lady's Book_). One of her chief\ncollections of stories is _Pencil Sketches_ (1833-1837). \"Miss\nLeslie,\" wrote Edgar Allan Poe, \"is celebrated for the homely\nnaturalness of her stories and for the broad satire of her comic\nstyle.\" She was the editor of _The Gift_ one of the best annuals of\nthe time, and in that position perhaps exerted her chief influence on\nAmerican literature When one has read three or four representative\nstories by these seven authors one can grasp them all. Their titles as\na rule strike the keynote. These writers, except \"the Widow Bedott,\"\nare perhaps sentimentalists rather than humorists in intention, but\nread in the light of later days their apparent serious delineations of\nthe frolics and foibles of their time take on a highly humorous\naspect.\n\nGeorge Pope Morris (1802-1864) was one of the founders of _The New\nYork Mirror_, and for a time its editor. He is best known as the\nauthor of the poem, _Woodman, Spare That Tree_, and other poems and\nsongs. _The Little Frenchman and His Water Lots_ (1839), the first\nstory in the present volume, is selected not because Morris was\nespecially prominent in the field of the short story or humorous prose\nbut because of this single story's representative character. Edgar\nAllan Poe (1809-1849) follows with _The Angel of the Odd_ (October,\n1844, _Columbian Magazine_), perhaps the best of his humorous stories.\n_The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether_ (November, 1845, _Graham's\nMagazine_) may be rated higher, but it is not essentially a humorous\nstory. Rather it is incisive satire, with too biting an undercurrent\nto pass muster in the company of the genial in literature. Poe's\nhumorous stories as a whole have tended to belittle rather than\nincrease his fame, many of them verging on the inane. There are some,\nhowever, which are at least excellent fooling; few more than that.\n\nProbably this is hardly the place for an extended discussion of Poe,\nsince the present volume covers neither American literature as a whole\nnor the American short story in general, and Poe is not a humorist in\nhis more notable productions. Let it be said that Poe invented or\nperfected--more exactly, perfected his own invention of--the modern\nshort story; that is his general and supreme achievement. He also\nstands superlative for the quality of three varieties of short\nstories, those of terror, beauty and ratiocination. In the first class\nbelong _A Descent into the Maelstrom_ (1841), _The Pit and the\nPendulum_ (1842), _The Black Cat_ (1843), and _The Cask of\nAmontillado_ (1846). In the realm of beauty his notable productions\nare _The Assignation_ (1834), _Shadow: a Parable_ (1835), _Ligeia_\n(1838), _The Fall of the House of Usher_ (1839), _Eleonora_ (1841),\nand _The Masque of the Red Death_ (1842). The tales of\nratiocination--what are now generally termed detective\nstories--include _The Murders in the Rue Morgue_ (1841) and its\nsequel, _The Mystery of Marie Roget_ (1842-1843), _The Gold-Bug_\n(1843), _The Oblong Box_ (1844), _\"Thou Art the Man\"_ (1844), and _The\nPurloined Letter_ (1844).\n\nThen, too, Poe was a master of style, one of the greatest in English\nprose, possibly the greatest since De Quincey, and quite the most\nremarkable among American authors. Poe's influence on the short story\nform has been tremendous. Although the _effects_ of structure may be\nastounding in their power or unexpectedness, yet the _means_ by which\nthese effects are brought about are purely mechanical. Any student of\nfiction can comprehend them, almost any practitioner of fiction with a\nbent toward form can fairly master them. The merit of any short story\nproduction depends on many other elements as well--the value of the\nstructural element to the production as a whole depends first on the\nselection of the particular sort of structural scheme best suited to\nthe story in hand, and secondly, on the way in which this is\n_combined_ with the piece of writing to form a well-balanced whole.\nStyle is more difficult to imitate than structure, but on the other\nhand _the origin of structural influence_ is more difficult to trace\nthan that of style. So while, in a general way, we feel that Poe's\ninfluence on structure in the short story has been great, it is\ndifficult rather than obvious to trace particular instances. It is\nfelt in the advance of the general level of short story art. There is\nnothing personal about structure--there is everything personal about\nstyle. Poe's style is both too much his own and too superlatively good\nto be successfully imitated--whom have we had who, even if he were a\nmaster of structural effects, could be a second Poe? Looking at the\nmatter in another way, Poe's style is not his own at all. There is\nnothing \"personal\" about it in the petty sense of that term. Rather we\nfeel that, in the case of this author, universality has been attained.\nIt was Poe's good fortune to be himself in style, as often in content,\non a plane of universal appeal. But in some general characteristics of\nhis style his work can be, not perhaps imitated, but emulated. Greater\nvividness, deft impressionism, brevity that strikes instantly to a\ntelling effect--all these an author may have without imitating any\none's style but rather imitating excellence. Poe's \"imitators\" who\nhave amounted to anything have not tried to imitate him but to vie\nwith him. They are striving after perfectionism. Of course the sort of\ngood style in which Poe indulged is not the kind of style--or the\nvarieties of style--suited for all purposes, but for the purposes to\nwhich it is adapted it may well be called supreme.\n\nThen as a poet his work is almost or quite as excellent in a somewhat\nmore restricted range. In verse he is probably the best artist in\nAmerican letters. Here his sole pursuit was beauty, both of form and\nthought; he is vivid and apt, intensely lyrical but without much range\nof thought. He has deep intuitions but no comprehensive grasp of life.\n\nHis criticism is, on the whole, the least important part of his work.\nHe had a few good and brilliant ideas which came at just the right\ntime to make a stir in the world, and these his logical mind and\ntelling style enabled him to present to the best advantage. As a\ncritic he is neither broad-minded, learned, nor comprehensive. Nor is\nhe, except in the few ideas referred to, deep. He is, however,\nlimitedly original--perhaps intensely original within his narrow\nscope. But the excellences and limitations of Poe in any one part of\nhis work were his limitations and excellences in all.\n\nAs Poe's best short stories may be mentioned: _Metzengerstein_ (Jan.\n14, 1832, Philadelphia _Saturday Courier_), _Ms. Found in a Bottle_\n(October 19, 1833, _Baltimore Saturday Visiter_), _The Assignation_\n(January, 1834, _Godey's Lady's Book_), _Berenice_ (March, 1835,\n_Southern Literary Messenger_), _Morella_ (April, 1835, _Southern\nLiterary Messenger_), _The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall_\n(June, 1835, _Southern Literary Messenger_), _King Pest: a Tale\nContaining an Allegory_ (September, 1835, _Southern Literary\nMessenger_), _Shadow: a Parable_ (September, 1835, _Southern Literary\nMessenger_), _Ligeia_ (September, 1838, _American Museum_), _The Fall\nof the House of Usher_ (September, 1839, _Burton's Gentleman's\nMagazine_), _William Wilson_ (1839: _Gift for_ 1840), _The\nConversation of Eiros and Charmion_ (December, 1839, _Burton's\nGentleman's Magazine_), _The Murders in the Rue Morgue_ (April, 1841,\n_Graham's Magazine_), _A Descent into the Maelstrom_ (May, 1841,\n_Graham's Magazine_), _Eleonora_ (1841: _Gift_ for 1842), _The Masque\nof the Red Death_ (May, 1842, _Graham's Magazine_), _The Pit and the\nPendulum_ (1842: _Gift for 1843_), _The Tell-Tale Heart_ (January,\n1843, _Pioneer_), _The Gold-Bug_ (June 21 and 28, 1843, _Dollar\nNewspaper_), _The Black Cat_ (August 19, 1843, _United States Saturday\nPost_), _The Oblong Box_ (September, 1844, _Godey's Lady's Book_),\n_The Angel of the Odd_ (October, 1844, _Columbian Magazine_), _\"Thou\nArt the Man\"_ (November, 1844, _Godey's Lady's Book_), _The Purloined\nLetter_ (1844: _Gift_ for 1845), _The Imp of the Perverse_ (July,\n1845, _Graham's Magazine_), _The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether_\n(November, 1845, _Graham's Magazine_), _The Facts in the Case of M.\nValdemar_ (December, 1845, _American Whig Review_), _The Cask of\nAmontillado_ (November, 1846, _Godey's Lady's Book_), and _Lander's\nCottage_ (June 9, 1849, _Flag of Our Union_). Poe's chief collections\nare: _Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque_ (1840), _Tales_ (1845),\nand _The Works of the Late Edgar Allan Poe_ (1850-56). These titles\nhave been dropped from recent editions of his works, however, and the\nstories brought together under the title _Tales_, or under\nsubdivisions furnished by his editors, such as _Tales of\nRatiocination_, etc.\n\nCaroline Matilda Stansbury Kirkland (1801-1864) wrote of the frontier\nlife of the Middle West in the mid-nineteenth century. Her principal\ncollection of short stories is _Western Clearings_ (1845), from which\n_The Schoolmaster's Progress_, first published in _The Gift_ for 1845\n(out in 1844), is taken. Other stories republished in that collection\nare _The Ball at Thram's Huddle_ (April, 1840, _Knickerbocker\nMagazine_), _Recollections of the Land-Fever_ (September, 1840,\n_Knickerbocker Magazine_), and _The Bee-Tree_ (_The Gift_ for 1842;\nout in 1841). Her description of the country schoolmaster, \"a puppet\ncut out of shingle and jerked by a string,\" and the local color in\ngeneral of this and other stories give her a leading place among the\nwriters of her period who combined fidelity in delineating frontier\nlife with sufficient fictional interest to make a pleasing whole of\npermanent value.\n\nGeorge William Curtis (1824-1892) gained his chief fame as an\nessayist, and probably became best known from the department which he\nconducted, from 1853, as _The Editor's Easy Chair_ for _Harper's\nMagazine_ for many years. His volume, _Prue and I_ (1856), contains\nmany fictional elements, and a story from it, _Titbottom's\nSpectacles_, which first appeared in Putnam's Monthly for December,\n1854, is given in this volume because it is a good humorous short\nstory rather than because of its author's general eminence in this\nfield. Other stories of his worth noting are _The Shrouded Portrait_\n(in _The Knickerbocker Gallery_, 1855) and _The Millenial Club_\n(November, 1858, _Knickerbocker Magazine_).\n\nEdward Everett Hale (1822-1909) is chiefly known as the author of the\nshort story, _The Man Without a Country_ (December, 1863, _Atlantic\nMonthly_), but his venture in the comic vein, _My Double; and How He\nUndid Me_ (September, 1859, _Atlantic Monthly_), is equally worthy of\nappreciation. It was his first published story of importance. Other\nnoteworthy stories of his are: _The Brick Moon_ (October, November and\nDecember, 1869, _Atlantic Monthly_), _Life in the Brick Moon_\n(February, 1870, _Atlantic Monthly_), and _Susan's Escort_ (May, 1890,\n_Harper's Magazine_). His chief volumes of short stories are: _The Man\nWithout a Country, and Other Tales_ (1868); _The Brick Moon, and Other\nStories_ (1873); _Crusoe in New York, and Other Tales_ (1880); and\n_Susan's Escort, and Others_ (1897). The stories by Hale which have\nmade his fame all show ability of no mean order; but they are\ncharacterized by invention and ingenuity rather than by suffusing\nimagination. There is not much homogeneity about Hale's work. Almost\nany two stories of his read as if they might have been written by\ndifferent authors. For the time being perhaps this is an\nadvantage--his stories charm by their novelty and individuality. In\nthe long run, however, this proves rather a handicap. True\nindividuality, in literature as in the other arts, consists not in\n\"being different\" on different occasions--in different works--so much\nas in being _samely_ different from other writers; in being\n_consistently_ one's self, rather than diffusedly various selves. This\ndoes not lessen the value of particular stories, of course. It merely\ninjures Hale's fame as a whole. Perhaps some will chiefly feel not so\nmuch that his stories are different among themselves, but that they\nare not strongly anything--anybody's--in particular, that they lack\nstrong personality. The pathway to fame is strewn with stray\nexhibitions of talent. Apart from his purely literary productions,\nHale was one of the large moral forces of his time, through \"uplift\"\nboth in speech and the written word.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894), one of the leading wits of American\nliterature, is not at all well known as a short story writer, nor did\nhe write many brief pieces of fiction. His fame rests chiefly on his\npoems and on the _Breakfast-Table_ books (1858-1860-1872-1890). _Old\nIronsides_, _The Last Leaf_, _The Chambered Nautilus_ and _Homesick in\nHeaven_ are secure of places in the anthologies of the future, while\nhis lighter verse has made him one of the leading American writers of\n\"familiar verse.\" Frederick Locker-Lampson in the preface to the first\nedition of his _Lyra Elegantiarum_ (1867) declared that Holmes was\n\"perhaps the best living writer of this species of verse.\" His\ntrenchant attack on _Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions_ (1842)\nmakes us wonder what would have been his attitude toward some of the\nbeliefs of our own day; Christian Science, for example. He might have\n\"exposed\" it under some such title as _The Religio-Medical\nMasquerade_, or brought the batteries of his humor to bear on it in\nthe manner of Robert Louis Stevenson's fable, _Something In It_:\n\"Perhaps there is not much in it, as I supposed; but there is\nsomething in it after all. Let me be thankful for that.\" In Holmes'\nlong works of fiction, Elsie Venner (1861), _The Guardian Angel_\n(1867) and _A Mortal Antipathy_ (1885), the method is still somewhat\nthat of the essayist. I have found a short piece of fiction by him in\nthe March, 1832, number of _The New England Magazine_, called _The\nDebut_, signed O.W.H. _The Story of Iris_ in _The Professor at the\nBreakfast Table_, which ran in _The Atlantic_ throughout 1859, and _A\nVisit to the Asylum for Aged and Decayed Punsters_ (January, 1861,\n_Atlantic_) are his only other brief fictions of which I am aware. The\nlast named has been given place in the present selection because it is\ncharacteristic of a certain type and period of American humor,\nalthough its short story qualities are not particularly strong.\n\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), who achieved fame as \"Mark\nTwain,\" is only incidentally a short story writer, although he wrote\nmany short pieces of fiction. His humorous quality, I mean, is so\npreponderant, that one hardly thinks of the form. Indeed, he is never\nvery strong in fictional construction, and of the modern short story\nart he evidently knew or cared little. He is a humorist in the large\nsense, as are Rabelais and Cervantes, although he is also a humorist\nin various restricted applications of the word that are wholly\nAmerican. _The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County_ was his\nfirst publication of importance, and it saw the light in the Nov. 18,\n1865, number of _The Saturday Press_. It was republished in the\ncollection, _The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and\nOther Sketches_, in 1867. Others of his best pieces of short fiction\nare: _The Canvasser's Tale_ (December, 1876, _Atlantic Monthly_), _The\nL1,000,000 Bank Note_ (January, 1893, _Century Magazine_), _The\nEsquimau Maiden's Romance_ (November, 1893, _Cosmopolitan_),\n_Traveling with a Reformer_ (December, 1893, _Cosmopolitan_), _The Man\nThat Corrupted Hadleyburg_ (December, 1899, _Harper's_), _A\nDouble-Barrelled Detective Story_ (January and February, 1902,\n_Harper's_) _A Dog's Tale_ (December, 1903, _Harper's_), and _Eve's\nDiary_ (December, 1905, _Harper's_). Among Twain's chief collections\nof short stories are: _The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras\nCounty, and Other Sketches_ (1867); _The Stolen White Elephant_\n(1882), _The L1,000,000 Bank Note_ (1893), and _The Man That Corrupted\nHadleyburg, and Other Stories and Sketches_ (1900).\n\nHarry Stillwell Edwards (1855- ), a native of Georgia, together with\nSarah Barnwell Elliott (? - ) and Will N. Harben (1858-1919) have\ncontinued in the vein of that earlier writer, Augustus Baldwin\nLongstreet (1790-1870), author of _Georgia Scenes_ (1835). Edwards'\nbest work is to be found in his short stories of black and white life\nafter the manner of Richard Malcolm Johnston. He has written several\nnovels, but he is essentially a writer of human-nature sketches. \"He\nis humorous and picturesque,\" says Fred Lewis Pattee, \"and often he is\nfor a moment the master of pathos, but he has added nothing new and\nnothing commandingly distinctive.\"[3] An exception to this might be\nmade in favor of _Elder Brown's Backslide_ (August, 1885, _Harper's_),\na story in which all the elements are so nicely balanced that the\nresult may well be called a masterpiece of objective humor and pathos.\nOthers of his short stories especially worthy of mention are: _Two\nRunaways_ (July, 1886, _Century_), _Sister Todhunter's Heart_ (July,\n1887, _Century_), _\"De Valley an' de Shadder\"_ (January, 1888,\n_Century_), _An Idyl of \"Sinkin' Mount'in\"_ (October, 1888,\n_Century_), _The Rival Souls_ (March, 1889, _Century_), _The Woodhaven\nGoat_ (March, 1899, _Century_), and _The Shadow_ (December, 1906,\n_Century_). His chief collections are _Two Runaways, and Other\nStories_ (1889) and _His Defense, and Other Stories_ (1898).\n\nThe most notable, however, of the group of short story writers of\nGeorgia life is perhaps Richard Malcolm Johnston (1822-1898). He\nstands between Longstreet and the younger writers of Georgia life. His\nfirst book was _Georgia Sketches, by an Old Man (1864). _The Goose\nPond School_, a short story, had been written in 1857; it was not\npublished, however, till it appeared in the November and December,\n1869, numbers of a Southern magazine, _The New Eclectic_, over the\npseudonym \"Philemon Perch.\" His famous _Dukesborough Tales_\n(1871-1874) was largely a republication of the earlier book. Other\nnoteworthy collections of his are: _Mr. Absalom Billingslea and Other\nGeorgia Folk_ (1888), _Mr. Fortner's Marital Claims, and Other\nStories_ (1892), and _Old Times in Middle Georgia_ (1897). Among\nindividual stories stand out: _The Organ-Grinder_ (July, 1870, _New\nEclectic_), _Mr. Neelus Peeler's Conditions_ (June, 1879, _Scribner's\nMonthly_), _The Brief Embarrassment of Mr. Iverson Blount_ (September,\n1884, _Century_); _The Hotel Experience of Mr. Pink Fluker_ (June,\n1886, _Century_), republished in the present collection; _The Wimpy\nAdoptions_ (February, 1887, _Century_), _The Experiments of Miss Sally\nCash_ (September, 1888, _Century_), and _Our Witch_ (March, 1897,\n_Century_). Johnston must be ranked almost with Bret Harte as a\npioneer in \"local color\" work, although his work had little\nrecognition until his _Dukesborough Tales_ were republished by Harper\n& Brothers in 1883.\n\nBret Harte (1839-1902) is mentioned here owing to the late date of his\nstory included in this volume, _Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff_\n(March, 1901, _Harper's_), although his work as a whole of course\nbelongs to an earlier period of our literature. It is now well-thumbed\nliterary history that _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ (August, 1868,\n_Overland_) and _The Outcasts of Poker Flat_ (January, 1869,\n_Overland_) brought him a popularity that, in its suddenness and\nextent, had no precedent in American literature save in the case of\nMrs. Stowe and _Uncle Tom's Cabin_. According to Harte's own\nstatement, made in the retrospect of later years, he set out\ndeliberately to add a new province to American literature. Although\nhis work has been belittled because he has chosen exceptional and\ntheatric happenings, yet his real strength came from his contact with\nWestern life.\n\nIrving and Dickens and other models served only to teach him his art.\n\"Finally,\" says Prof. Pattee, \"Harte was the parent of the modern form\nof the short story. It was he who started Kipling and Cable and Thomas\nNelson Page. Few indeed have surpassed him in the mechanics of this\nmost difficult of arts. According to his own belief, the form is an\nAmerican product ... Harte has described the genesis of his own art.\nIt sprang from the Western humor and was developed by the\ncircumstances that surrounded him. Many of his short stories are\nmodels. They contain not a superfluous word, they handle a single\nincident with grapic power, they close without moral or comment. The\nform came as a natural evolution from his limitations and powers. With\nhim the story must of necessity be brief.... Bret Harte was the artist\nof impulse, the painter of single burning moments, the flashlight\nphotographer who caught in lurid detail one dramatic episode in the\nlife of a man or a community and left the rest in darkness.\"[4]\n\nHarte's humor is mostly \"Western humor\" There is not always uproarious\nmerriment, but there is a constant background of humor. I know of no\nmore amusing scene in American literature than that in the courtroom\nwhen the Colonel gives his version of the deacon's method of signaling\nto the widow in Harte's story included in the present volume, _Colonel\nStarbottle for the Plaintiff_. Here is part of it:\n\n\"True to the instructions she had received from him, her lips part in\nthe musical utterance (the Colonel lowered his voice in a faint\nfalsetto, presumably in fond imitation of his fair client) 'Kerree!'\nInstantly the night becomes resonant with the impassioned reply (the\nColonel here lifted his voice in stentorian tones), 'Kerrow!' Again,\nas he passes, rises the soft 'Kerree!'; again, as his form is lost in\nthe distance, comes back the deep 'Kerrow!'\"\n\nWhile Harte's stories all have in them a certain element or background\nof humor, yet perhaps the majority of them are chiefly romantic or\ndramatic even more than they are humorous.\n\nAmong the best of his short stories may be mentioned: _The Luck of\nRoaring Camp_ (August, 1868, _Overland_), _The Outcasts of Poker Flat_\n(January, 1869, _Overland_), _Tennessee's Partner_ (October, 1869,\n_Overland_), _Brown of Calaveras_ (March, 1870, _Overland_), _Flip: a\nCalifornia Romance_ (in _Flip, and Other Stories_, 1882), _Left Out on\nLone Star Mountain_ (January, 1884, _Longman's_), _An Ingenue of the\nSierras_ (July, 1894, _McClure's_), _The Bell-Ringer of Angel's_ (in\n_The Bell-Ringer of Angel's, and Other Stories_, 1894), _Chu Chu_ (in\n_The Bell-Ringer of Angel's, and Other Stories_, 1894), _The Man and\nthe Mountain_ (in _The Ancestors of Peter Atherly, and Other Tales_,\n1897), _Salomy Jane's Kiss_ (in _Stories in Light and Shadow_, 1898),\n_The Youngest Miss Piper_ (February, 1900, _Leslie's Monthly_),\n_Colonel Starbottle for the Plaintiff_ (March, 1901, _Harper's_), _A\nMercury of the Foothills_ (July, 1901, _Cosmopolitan_), _Lanty\nFoster's Mistake_ (December, 1901, _New England_), _An Ali Baba of the\nSierras_ (January 4, 1902, _Saturday Evening Post_), and _Dick Boyle's\nBusiness Card_ (in _Trent's Trust, and Other Stories_, 1903). Among\nhis notable collections of stories are: _The Luck of Roaring Camp, and\nOther Sketches_ (1870), _Flip, and Other Stories_ (1882), _On the\nFrontier_ (1884), _Colonel Starbottle's Client, and Some Other People_\n(1892), _A Protege of Jack Hamlin's, and Other Stories_ (1894), _The\nBell-Ringer of Angel's, and Other Stories_ (1894), _The Ancestors of\nPeter Atherly, and Other Tales_ (1897), _Openings in the Old Trail_\n(1902), and _Trent's Trust, and Other Stories_ (1903). The titles and\nmakeup of several of his collections were changed when they came to be\narranged in the complete edition of his works.[5]\n\nHenry Cuyler Bunner (1855-1896) is one of the humorous geniuses of\nAmerican literature. He is equally at home in clever verse or the\nbrief short story. Prof. Fred Lewis Pattee has summed up his\nachievement as follows: \"Another [than Stockton] who did much to\nadvance the short story toward the mechanical perfection it had\nattained to at the close of the century was Henry Cuyler Bunner,\neditor of _Puck_ and creator of some of the most exquisite _vers de\nsociete_ of the period. The title of one of his collections, _Made in\nFrance: French Tales Retold with a U.S. Twist_ (1893), forms an\nintroduction to his fiction. Not that he was an imitator; few have\nbeen more original or have put more of their own personality into\ntheir work. His genius was Gallic. Like Aldrich, he approached the\nshort story from the fastidious standpoint of the lyric poet. With\nhim, as with Aldrich, art was a matter of exquisite touches, of\ninfinite compression, of almost imperceptible shadings. The lurid\nsplashes and the heavy emphasis of the local colorists offended his\nsensitive taste: he would work with suggestion, with microscopic\nfocussings, and always with dignity and elegance. He was more American\nthan Henry James, more even than Aldrich. He chose always\ndistinctively American subjects--New York City was his favorite\ntheme--and his work had more depth of soul than Stockton's or\nAldrich's. The story may be trivial, a mere expanded anecdote, yet it\nis sure to be so vitally treated that, like Maupassant's work, it\ngrips and remains, and, what is more, it lifts and chastens or\nexplains. It may be said with assurance that _Short Sixes_ marks one\nof the high places which have been attained by the American short\nstory.\"[6]\n\nAmong Bunner's best stories are: _Love in Old Cloathes_ (September,\n1883, _Century), A Successful Failure_ (July, 1887, _Puck_), _The\nLove-Letters of Smith_ (July 23, 1890, _Puck_) _The Nice People_ (July\n30, 1890, _Puck_), _The Nine Cent-Girls_ (August 13, 1890, _Puck_),\n_The Two Churches of 'Quawket_ (August 27, 1890, _Puck_), _A Round-Up_\n(September 10, 1890, _Puck_), _A Sisterly Scheme_ (September 24, 1890,\n_Puck_), _Our Aromatic Uncle_ (August, 1895, _Scribner's_), _The\nTime-Table Test_ (in _The Suburban Sage_, 1896). He collaborated with\nProf. Brander Matthews in several stories, notably in _The Documents\nin the Case_ (Sept., 1879, _Scribner's Monthly_). His best collections\nare: _Short Sixes: _Stories to be Read While the Candle Burns_ (1891),\n_More Short Sixes _(1894), and _Love in Old Cloathes, and Other\nStories_ (1896).\n\nAfter Poe and Hawthorne almost the first author in America to make a\nvertiginous impression by his short stories was Bret Harte. The wide\nand sudden popularity he attained by the publication of his two short\nstories, _The Luck of Roaring Camp_ (1868) and _The Outcasts of Poker\nFlat_ (1869), has already been noted.[7] But one story just before\nHarte that astonished the fiction audience with its power and art was\nHarriet Prescott Spofford's (1835- ) _The Amber Gods_ (January and\nFebruary, 1860, Atlantic), with its startling ending, \"I must have\ndied at ten minutes past one.\" After Harte the next story to make a\ngreat sensation was Thomas Bailey Aldrich's _Marjorie Daw_ (April,\n1873, _Atlantic_), a story with a surprise at the end, as had been his\n_A Struggle for Life_ (July, 1867, _Atlantic_), although it was only\n_Marjorie Daw_ that attracted much attention at the time. Then came\nGeorge Washington Cable's (1844- ) _\"Posson Jone',\"_ (April 1, 1876,\n_Appleton's Journal_) and a little later Charles Egbert Craddock's\n(1850- ) _The Dancin' Party at Harrison's Cove_ (May, 1878,\n_Atlantic_) and _The Star in the Valley_ (November, 1878, _Atlantic_).\nBut the work of Cable and Craddock, though of sterling worth, won its\nway gradually. Even Edward Everett Hale's (1822-1909) _My Double; and\nHow He Undid Me_ (September, 1859, _Atlantic_) and _The Man Without a\nCountry_ (December, 1863, _Atlantic_) had fallen comparatively\nstill-born. The truly astounding short story successes, after Poe and\nHawthorne, then, were Spofford, Bret Harte and Aldrich. Next came\nFrank Richard Stockton (1834-1902). \"The interest created by the\nappearance of _Marjorie Daw_,\" says Prof. Pattee, \"was mild compared\nwith that accorded to Frank R. Stockton's _The Lady or the Tiger?_\n(1884). Stockton had not the technique of Aldrich nor his naturalness\nand ease. Certainly he had not his atmosphere of the _beau monde_ and\nhis grace of style, but in whimsicality and unexpectedness and in that\nsubtle art that makes the obviously impossible seem perfectly\nplausible and commonplace he surpassed not only him but Edward Everett\nHale and all others. After Stockton and _The Lady or the Tiger?_ it\nwas realized even by the uncritical that short story writing had\nbecome a subtle art and that the master of its subtleties had his\nreader at his mercy.\"[8] The publication of Stockton's short stories\ncovers a period of over forty years, from _Mahala's Drive_ (November,\n1868, _Lippincott's_) to _The Trouble She Caused When She Kissed_\n(December, 1911, _Ladies' Home Journal_), published nine years after\nhis death. Among the more notable of his stories may be mentioned:\n_The Transferred Ghost_ (May, 1882, _Century_), _The Lady or the\nTiger?_ (November, 1882, _Century_), _The Reversible Landscape_ (July,\n1884, _Century_), _The Remarkable Wreck of the \"Thomas Hyke\"_ (August,\n1884, _Century_), _\"His Wife's Deceased Sister\"_ (January, 1884,\n_Century_), _A Tale of Negative Gravity_ (December, 1884, _Century_),\n_The Christmas Wreck_ (in _The Christmas Wreck, and Other Stories_,\n1886), _Amos Kilbright_ (in _Amos Kilbright, His Adscititious\nExperiences, with Other Stories_, 1888), _Asaph_ (May, 1892,\n_Cosmopolitan_), _My Terminal Moraine_ (April 26, 1892, Collier's\n_Once a Week Library_), _The Magic Egg_ (June, 1894, _Century_), _The\nBuller-Podington Compact_ (August, 1897, _Scribner's_), and _The\nWidow's Cruise_ (in _A Story-Teller's Pack_, 1897). Most of his best\nwork was gathered into the collections: _The Lady or the Tiger?, and\nOther Stories_ (1884), _The Bee-Man of Orn, and Other Fanciful Tales_\n(1887), _Amos Kilbright, His Adscititious Experiences, with Other\nStories_ (1888), _The Clocks of Rondaine, and Other Stories_ (1892),\n_A Chosen Few_ (1895), _A Story-Teller's Pack_ (1897), and _The\nQueen's Museum, and Other Fanciful Tales_ (1906).\n\nAfter Stockton and Bunner come O. Henry (1862-1910) and Jack London\n(1876-1916), apostles of the burly and vigorous in fiction. Beside or\nabove them stand Henry James (1843-1916)--although he belongs to an\nearlier period as well--Edith Wharton (1862- ), Alice Brown (1857- ),\nMargaret Wade Deland (1857- ), and Katharine Fullerton Gerould\n(1879- ), practitioners in all that O. Henry and London are not, of\nthe finer fields, the more subtle nuances of modern life. With O.\nHenry and London, though perhaps less noteworthy, are to be grouped\nGeorge Randolph Chester (1869- ) and Irvin Shrewsbury Cobb (1876- ).\nThen, standing rather each by himself, are Melville Davisson Post\n(1871- ), a master of psychological mystery stories, and Wilbur Daniel\nSteele (1886- ), whose work it is hard to classify. These ten names\nrepresent much that is best in American short story production since\nthe beginning of the twentieth century (1900). Not all are notable for\nhumor; but inasmuch as any consideration of the American humorous\nshort story cannot be wholly dissociated from a consideration of the\nAmerican short story in general, it has seemed not amiss to mention\nthese authors here. Although Sarah Orne Jewett (1849-1909) lived on\ninto the twentieth century and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman (1862- ) is\nstill with us, the best and most typical work of these two writers\nbelongs in the last two decades of the previous century. To an earlier\nperiod also belong Charles Egbert Craddock (1850- ), George Washington\nCable (1844- ), Thomas Nelson Page (1853- ), Constance Fenimore\nWoolson (1848-1894), Harriet Prescott Spofford (1835- ), Hamlin\nGarland (1860- ), Ambrose Bierce (1842-?), Rose Terry Cooke\n(1827-1892), and Kate Chopin (1851-1904).\n\n\"O. Henry\" was the pen name adopted by William Sydney Porter. He began\nhis short story career by contributing _Whistling Dick's Christmas\nStocking_ to _McClure's Magazine_ in 1899. He followed it with many\nstories dealing with Western and South- and Central-American life, and\nlater came most of his stories of the life of New York City, in which\nfield lies most of his best work. He contributed more stories to the\n_New York World_ than to any other one publication--as if the stories\nof the author who later came to be hailed as \"the American Maupassant\"\nwere not good enough for the \"leading\" magazines but fit only for the\nsensation-loving public of the Sunday papers! His first published\nstory that showed distinct strength was perhaps _A Blackjack\nBargainer_ (August, 1901, _Munsey's_). He followed this with such\nmasterly stories as: _The Duplicity of Hargraves_ (February, 1902,\n_Junior Munsey_), _The Marionettes_ (April, 1902, _Black Cat_), _A\nRetrieved Reformation_ (April, 1903, _Cosmopolitan_), _The Guardian of\nthe Accolade_ (May, 1903, _Cosmopolitan_), _The Enchanted Kiss_\n(February, 1904, _Metropolitan_), _The Furnished Room_ (August 14,\n1904, _New York World_), _An Unfinished Story_ (August, 1905,\n_McClure's_), _The Count and the Wedding Guest_ (October 8, 1905, _New\nYork World_), _The Gift of the Magi_ (December 10, 1905, _New York\nWorld_), _The Trimmed Lamp_ (August, 1906, _McClure's_), _Phoebe_\n(November, 1907, _Everybody's_), _The Hiding of Black Bill_ (October,\n1908, _Everybody's_), _No Story_ (June, 1909, _Metropolitan_), _A\nMunicipal Report_ (November, 1909, _Hampton's_), _A Service of Love_\n(in _The Four Million_, 1909), _The Pendulum_ (in _The Trimmed Lamp_,\n1910), _Brickdust Row_ (in _The Trimmed Lamp_, 1910), and _The\nAssessor of Success_ (in _The Trimmed Lamp_, 1910). Among O. Henry's\nbest volumes of short stories are: _The Four Million_ (1909),\n_Options_ (1909), _Roads of Destiny_ (1909), _The Trimmed Lamp_\n(1910), _Strictly Business: More Stories of the Four Million_ (1910),\n_Whirligigs_ (1910), and _Sixes and Sevens_ (1911).\n\n\"Nowhere is there anything just like them. In his best work--and his\ntales of the great metropolis are his best--he is unique. The soul of\nhis art is unexpectedness. Humor at every turn there is, and sentiment\nand philosophy and surprise. One never may be sure of himself. The end\nis always a sensation. No foresight may predict it, and the sensation\nalways is genuine. Whatever else O. Henry was, he was an artist, a\nmaster of plot and diction, a genuine humorist, and a philosopher. His\nweakness lay in the very nature of his art. He was an entertainer bent\nonly on amusing and surprising his reader. Everywhere brilliancy, but\ntoo often it is joined to cheapness; art, yet art merging swiftly into\ncaricature. Like Harte, he cannot be trusted. Both writers on the\nwhole may be said to have lowered the standards of American\nliterature, since both worked in the surface of life with theatric\nintent and always without moral background, O. Henry moves, but he\nnever lifts. All is fortissimo; he slaps the reader on the back and\nlaughs loudly as if he were in a bar-room. His characters, with few\nexceptions, are extremes, caricatures. Even his shop girls, in the\nlimning of whom he did his best work, are not really individuals;\nrather are they types, symbols. His work was literary vaudeville,\nbrilliant, highly amusing, and yet vaudeville.\"[9] _The Duplicity of\nHargraves_, the story by O. Henry given in this volume, is free from\nmost of his defects. It has a blend of humor and pathos that puts it\non a plane of universal appeal.\n\nGeorge Randolph Chester (1869- ) gained distinction by creating the\ngenial modern business man of American literature who is not content\nto \"get rich quick\" through the ordinary channels. Need I say that I\nrefer to that amazing compound of likeableness and sharp practices,\nGet-Rich-Quick Wallingford? The story of his included in this volume,\n_Bargain Day at Tutt House_ (June, 1905, _McClure's_), was nearly his\nfirst story; only two others, which came out in _The Saturday Evening\nPost_ in 1903 and 1904, preceded it. Its breathless dramatic action is\nwell balanced by humor. Other stories of his deserving of special\nmention are: _A Corner in Farmers_ (February, 29, 1908, _Saturday\nEvening Post_), _A Fortune in Smoke_ (March 14, 1908, _Saturday\nEvening Post_), _Easy Money_ (November 14, 1908, _Saturday Evening\nPost_), _The Triple Cross_ (December 5, 1908, _Saturday Evening\nPost_), _Spoiling the Egyptians_ (December 26, 1908, _Saturday Evening\nPost_), _Whipsawed!_ (January 16, 1909, _Saturday Evening Post_), _The\nBubble Bank_ (January 30 and February 6, 1909, _Saturday Evening\nPost_), _Straight Business_ (February 27, 1909, _Saturday Evening\nPost_), _Sam Turner: a Business Man's Love Story_ (March 26, April 2\nand 9, 1910, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Fundamental Justice_ (July 25,\n1914, _Saturday Evening Post_), _A Scropper Patcher_ (October, 1916,\n_Everybody's_), and _Jolly Bachelors_ (February, 1918,\n_Cosmopolitan_). His best collections are: _Get-Rich-Quick\nWallingford_ (1908), _Young Wallingford_ (1910), _Wallingford in His\nPrime_ (1913), and _Wallingford and Blackie Daw_ (1913). It is often\ndifficult to find in his books short stories that one may be looking\nfor, for the reason that the titles of the individual stories have\nbeen removed in order to make the books look like novels subdivided\ninto chapters.\n\nGrace MacGowan Cooke (1863- ) is a writer all of whose work has\ninterest and perdurable stuff in it, but few are the authors whose\nachievements in the American short story stand out as a whole. In _A\nCall_ (August, 1906, _Harper's_) she surpasses herself and is not\nperhaps herself surpassed by any of the humorous short stories that\nhave come to the fore so far in America in the twentieth century. The\nstory is no less delightful in its fidelity to fact and understanding\nof young human nature than in its relish of humor. Some of her stories\ndeserving of special mention are: _The Capture of Andy Proudfoot_\n(June, 1904, _Harper's_), _In the Strength of the Hills_ (December,\n1905, _Metropolitan_), _The Machinations of Ocoee Gallantine_ (April,\n1906, _Century_), _A Call_ (August, 1906, _Harper's_), _Scott\nBohannon's Bond _(May 4, 1907, _Collier's_), and _A Clean Shave_\n(November, 1912, _Century_). Her best short stories do not seem to\nhave been collected in volumes as yet, although she has had several\nnotable long works of fiction published, such as _The Power and the\nGlory_ (1910), and several good juveniles.\n\nWilliam James Lampton (?-1917), who was known to many of his admirers\nas Will Lampton or as W.J.L. merely, was one of the most unique and\ninteresting characters of literary and Bohemian New York from about\n1895 to his death in 1917. I remember walking up Fifth Avenue with him\none Sunday afternoon just after he had shown me a letter from the man\nwho was then Comptroller of the Currency. The letter was signed so\nillegibly that my companion was in doubts as to the sender, so he\nsuggested that we stop at a well-known hotel at the corner of 59th\nStreet, and ask the manager who the Comptroller of the Currency then\nwas, so that he might know whom the letter was from. He said that the\nmanager of a big hotel like that, where many prominent people stayed,\nwould be sure to know. When this problem had been solved to our\nsatisfaction, John Skelton Williams proving to be the man, Lampton\nsaid, \"Now you've told me who he is, I'll show you who I am.\" So he\nasked for a copy of _The American Magazine_ at a newsstand in the\nhotel corridor, opened it, and showed the manager a full-page picture\nof himself clad in a costume suggestive of the time of Christopher\nColumbus, with high ruffs around his neck, that happened to appear in\nthe magazine the current month. I mention this incident to illustrate\nthe lack of conventionality and whimsical originality of the man, that\nstood out no less forcibly in his writings than in his daily life. He\nhad little use for \"doing the usual thing in the usual sort of way.\"\nHe first gained prominence by his book of verse, _Yawps_ (1900). His\npoems were free from convention in technique as well as in spirit,\nalthough their chief innovation was simply that as a rule there was no\nregular number of syllables in a line; he let the lines be any length\nthey wanted to be, to fit the sense or the length of what he had to\nsay. He once said to me that if anything of his was remembered he\nthought it would be his poem,_Lo, the Summer Girl_. His muse often\ntook the direction of satire, but it was always good-natured even when\nit hit the hardest. He had in his makeup much of the detached\nphilosopher, like Cervantes and Mark Twain.\n\nThere was something cosmic about his attitude to life, and this showed\nin much that he did. He was the only American writer of humorous verse\nof his day whom I always cared to read, or whose lines I could\nremember more than a few weeks. This was perhaps because his work was\nnever _merely_ humorous, but always had a big sweep of background to\nit, like the ruggedness of the Kentucky mountains from which he came.\nIt was Colonel George Harvey, then editor of _Harper's Weekly_, who\nhad started the boom to make Woodrow Wilson President. Wilson\nafterwards, at least seemingly, repudiated his sponsor, probably\nbecause of Harvey's identification with various moneyed interests.\nLampton's poem on the subject, with its refrain, \"Never again, said\nColonel George,\" I remember as one of the most notable of his poems on\ncurrent topics. But what always seemed to me the best of his poems\ndealing with matters of the hour was one that I suggested he write,\nwhich dealt with gift-giving to the public, at about the time that\nAndrew Carnegie was making a big stir with his gifts for libraries,\nbeginning:\n\n  Dunno, perhaps\n  One of the yaps\n  Like me would make\n  A holy break\n  Doing his turn\n  With money to burn.\n    Anyhow, I\n    Wouldn't shy\n    Making a try!\n\nand containing, among many effective touches, the pathetic lines,\n\n  ... I'd help\n  The poor who try to help themselves,\n  Who have to work so hard for bread\n  They can't get very far ahead.\n\nWhen James Lane Allen's novel, _The Reign of Law_, came out (1900), a\nlittle quatrain by Lampton that appeared in _The Bookman_ (September,\n1900) swept like wildfire across the country, and was read by a\nhundred times as many people as the book itself:\n\n  \"The Reign of Law\"?\n    Well, Allen, you're lucky;\n  It's the first time it ever\n    Rained law in Kentucky!\n\nThe reader need not be reminded that at that period Kentucky family\nfeuds were well to the fore. As Lampton had started as a poet, the\neditors were bound to keep him pigeon-holed as far as they could, and\nhis ambition to write short stories was not at first much encouraged\nby them. His predicament was something like that of the chief\ncharacter of Frank R. Stockton's story, \"_His Wife's Deceased Sister_\"\n(January, 1884, _Century_), who had written a story so good that\nwhenever he brought the editors another story they invariably answered\nin substance, \"We're afraid it won't do. Can't you give us something\nlike '_His Wife's Deceased Sister_'?\" This was merely Stockton's\nturning to account his own somewhat similar experience with the\neditors after his story, _The Lady or the Tiger_? (November, 1882,\n_Century_) appeared. Likewise the editors didn't want Lampton's short\nstories for a while because they liked his poems so well.\n\nDo I hear some critics exclaiming that there is nothing remarkable\nabout _How the Widow Won the Deacon_, the story by Lampton included in\nthis volume? It handles an amusing situation lightly and with grace.\nIt is one of those things that read easily and are often difficult to\nachieve. Among his best stories are: _The People's Number of the\nWorthyville Watchman_ (May 12, 1900, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Love's\nStrange Spell_ (April 27, 1901, _Saturday Evening Post_), _Abimelech\nHiggins' Way_ (August 24, 1001, _Saturday Evening Post_), _A Cup of\nTea_ (March, 1902, _Metropolitan_), _Winning His Spurs_ (May, 1904,\n_Cosmopolitan_), _The Perfidy of Major Pulsifer_ (November, 1909,\n_Cosmopolitan_), _How the Widow Won the Deacon_ (April, 1911,\n_Harper's Bazaar_), and _A Brown Study_ (December, 1913,\n_Lippincott's_). There is no collection as yet of his short stories.\nAlthough familiarly known as \"Colonel\" Lampton, and although of\nKentucky, he was not merely a \"Kentucky Colonel,\" for he was actually\nappointed Colonel on the staff of the governor of Kentucky. At the\ntime of his death he was about to be made a brigadier-general and was\nplanning to raise a brigade of Kentucky mountaineers for service in\nthe Great War. As he had just struck his stride in short story\nwriting, the loss to literature was even greater than the patriotic\nloss.\n\n_Gideon_ (April, 1914, _Century_), by Wells Hastings (1878- ), the\nstory with which this volume closes, calls to mind the large number of\nnotable short stories in American literature by writers who have made\nno large name for themselves as short story writers, or even otherwise\nin letters. American literature has always been strong in its \"stray\"\nshort stories of note. In Mr. Hastings' case, however, I feel that the\nfame is sure to come. He graduated from Yale in 1902, collaborated\nwith Brian Hooker (1880- ) in a novel, _The Professor's Mystery_\n(1911) and alone wrote another novel, _The Man in the Brown Derby_\n(1911). His short stories include: _The New Little Boy_ (July, 1911,\n_American_), _That Day_ (September, 1911, _American_), _The Pick-Up_\n(December, 1911, _Everybody's_), and _Gideon_ (April, 1914,\n_Century_). The last story stands out. It can be compared without\ndisadvantage to the best work, or all but the very best work, of\nThomas Nelson Page, it seems to me. And from the reader's standpoint\nit has the advantage--is this not also an author's advantage?--of a\nmore modern setting and treatment. Mr. Hastings is, I have been told,\na director in over a dozen large corporations. Let us hope that his\nbusiness activities will not keep him too much away from the\nproduction of literature--for to rank as a piece of literature,\nsomething of permanent literary value, _Gideon_ is surely entitled.\n\nALEXANDER JESSUP.\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n_Alexander Jessup_\n\nTHE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS (1839)\n_George Pope Morris_\n\nTHE ANGEL OF THE ODD (1844)\n_Edgar Allan Poe_\n\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER'S PROGRESS (1844)\n_Caroline M.S.

Yet there are very few\nindividuals, let them be doing ever so well in the world, who are not\nalways straining every nerve to do better; and this is one of the many\ncauses why failures in business so frequently occur among us. The\npresent generation seem unwilling to \"realize\" by slow and sure\ndegrees; but choose rather to set their whole hopes upon a single\ncast, which either makes or mars them forever!\n\nGentle reader, do you remember Monsieur Poopoo? He used to keep a\nsmall toy-store in Chatham, near the corner of Pearl Street. You must\nrecollect him, of course. He lived there for many years, and was one\nof the most polite and accommodating of shopkeepers. When a juvenile,\nyou have bought tops and marbles of him a thousand times. To be sure\nyou have; and seen his vinegar-visage lighted up with a smile as you\nflung him the coppers; and you have laughed at his little straight\nqueue and his dimity breeches, and all the other oddities that made up\nthe every-day apparel of my little Frenchman. Ah, I perceive you\nrecollect him now.\n\nWell, then, there lived Monsieur Poopoo ever since he came from \"dear,\ndelightful Paris,\" as he was wont to call the city of his\nnativity--there he took in the pennies for his kickshaws--there he\nlaid aside five thousand dollars against a rainy day--there he was as\nhappy as a lark--and there, in all human probability, he would have\nbeen to this very day, a respected and substantial citizen, had he\nbeen willing to \"let well alone.\" But Monsieur Poopoo had heard\nstrange stories about the prodigious rise in real estate; and, having\nunderstood that most of his neighbors had become suddenly rich by\nspeculating in lots, he instantly grew dissatisfied with his own lot,\nforthwith determined to shut up shop, turn everything into cash, and\nset about making money in right-down earnest. No sooner said than\ndone; and our quondam storekeeper a few days afterward attended an\nextensive sale of real estate, at the Merchants' Exchange.\n\nThere was the auctioneer, with his beautiful and inviting lithographic\nmaps--all the lots as smooth and square and enticingly laid out as\npossible--and there were the speculators--and there, in the midst of\nthem, stood Monsieur Poopoo.\n\n\"Here they are, gentlemen,\" said he of the hammer, \"the most valuable\nlots ever offered for sale. Give me a bid for them!\"\n\n\"One hundred each,\" said a bystander.\n\n\"One hundred!\" said the auctioneer, \"scarcely enough to pay for the\nmaps. One hundred--going--and fifty--gone! Mr. H., they are yours. A\nnoble purchase. You'll sell those same lots in less than a fortnight\nfor fifty thousand dollars profit!\"\n\nMonsieur Poopoo pricked up his ears at this, and was lost in\nastonishment. This was a much easier way certainly of accumulating\nriches than selling toys in Chatham Street, and he determined to buy\nand mend his fortune without delay.\n\nThe auctioneer proceeded in his sale. Other parcels were offered and\ndisposed of, and all the purchasers were promised immense advantages\nfor their enterprise. At last came a more valuable parcel than all the\nrest. The company pressed around the stand, and Monsieur Poopoo did\nthe same.\n\n\"I now offer you, gentlemen, these magnificent lots, delightfully\nsituated on Long Island, with valuable water privileges. Property in\nfee--title indisputable--terms of sale, cash--deeds ready for delivery\nimmediately after the sale. How much for them? Give them a start at\nsomething. How much?\" The auctioneer looked around; there were no\nbidders. At last he caught the eye of Monsieur Poopoo. \"Did you say\none hundred, sir? Beautiful lots--valuable water privileges--shall I\nsay one hundred for you?\"\n\n\"_Oui, monsieur_; I will give you von hundred dollar apiece, for de\nlot vid de valuarble vatare privalege; _c'est ca_.\"\n\n\"Only one hundred apiece for these sixty valuable lots--only one\nhundred--going--going--going--gone!\"\n\nMonsieur Poopoo was the fortunate possessor. The auctioneer\ncongratulated him--the sale closed--and the company dispersed.\n\n\"_Pardonnez-moi, monsieur_,\" said Poopoo, as the auctioneer descended\nhis pedestal, \"you shall _excusez-moi_, if I shall go to _votre\nbureau_, your counting-house, ver quick to make every ting sure wid\nrespec to de lot vid de valuarble vatare privalege. Von leetle bird in\nde hand he vorth two in de tree, _c'est vrai_--eh?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Vell den, _allons_.\"\n\nAnd the gentlemen repaired to the counting-house, where the six\nthousand dollars were paid, and the deeds of the property delivered.\nMonsieur Poopoo put these carefully in his pocket, and as he was about\ntaking his leave, the auctioneer made him a present of the\nlithographic outline of the lots, which was a very liberal thing on\nhis part, considering the map was a beautiful specimen of that\nglorious art. Poopoo could not admire it sufficiently. There were his\nsixty lots, as uniform as possible, and his little gray eyes sparkled\nlike diamonds as they wandered from one end of the spacious sheet to\nthe other.\n\nPoopoo's heart was as light as a feather, and he snapped his fingers\nin the very wantonness of joy as he repaired to Delmonico's, and\nordered the first good French dinner that had gladdened his palate\nsince his arrival in America.\n\nAfter having discussed his repast, and washed it down with a bottle of\nchoice old claret, he resolved upon a visit to Long Island to view his\npurchase. He consequently immediately hired a horse and gig, crossed\nthe Brooklyn ferry, and drove along the margin of the river to the\nWallabout, the location in question.\n\nOur friend, however, was not a little perplexed to find his property.\nEverything on the map was as fair and even as possible, while all the\ngrounds about him were as undulated as they could well be imagined,\nand there was an elbow of the East River thrusting itself quite into\nthe ribs of the land, which seemed to have no business there. This\npuzzled the Frenchman exceedingly; and, being a stranger in those\nparts, he called to a farmer in an adjacent field.\n\n\"_Mon ami_, are you acquaint vid dis part of de country--eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was born here, and know every inch of it.\"\n\n\"Ah, _c'est bien_, dat vill do,\" and the Frenchman got out of the gig,\ntied the horse, and produced his lithographic map.\n\n\"Den maybe you vill have de kindness to show me de sixty lot vich I\nhave bought, vid de valuarble vatare privalege?\"\n\nThe farmer glanced his eye over the paper.\n\n\"Yes, sir, with pleasure; if you will be good enough to _get into my\nboat, I will row you out to them_!\"\n\n\"Vat dat you say, sure?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said the farmer, \"this section of Long Island has\nrecently been bought up by the speculators of New York, and laid out\nfor a great city; but the principal street is only visible _at low\ntide_. When this part of the East River is filled up, it will be just\nthere. Your lots, as you will perceive, are beyond it; _and are now\nall under water_.\"\n\nAt first the Frenchman was incredulous. He could not believe his\nsenses. As the facts, however, gradually broke upon him, he shut one\neye, squinted obliquely at the heavens---the river--the farmer--and\nthen he turned away and squinted at them all over again! There was his\npurchase sure enough; but then it could not be perceived for there was\na river flowing over it! He drew a box from his waistcoat pocket,\nopened it, with an emphatic knock upon the lid, took a pinch of snuff\nand restored it to his waistcoat pocket as before. Poopoo was\nevidently in trouble, having \"thoughts which often lie too deep for\ntears\"; and, as his grief was also too big for words, he untied his\nhorse, jumped into his gig, and returned to the auctioneer in hot\nhaste.\n\nIt was near night when he arrived at the auction-room--his horse in a\nfoam and himself in a fury. The auctioneer was leaning back in his\nchair, with his legs stuck out of a low window, quietly smoking a\ncigar after the labors of the day, and humming the music from the last\nnew opera.\n\n\"Monsieur, I have much plaisir to fin' you, _chez vous_, at home.\"\n\n\"Ah, Poopoo! glad to see you. Take a seat, old boy.\"\n\n\"But I shall not take de seat, sare.\"\n\n\"No--why, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, _beaucoup_ de matter. I have been to see de gran lot vot you sell\nme to-day.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I hope you like your purchase?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I no like him.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for it; but there is no ground for your complaint.\"\n\n\"No, sare; dare is no _ground_ at all--de ground is all vatare!\"\n\n\"You joke!\"\n\n\"I no joke. I nevare joke; _je n'entends pas la raillerie_, Sare,\n_voulez-vous_ have de kindness to give me back de money vot I pay!\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Den vill you be so good as to take de East River off de top of my\nlot?\"\n\n\"That's your business, sir, not mine.\"\n\n\"Den I make von _mauvaise affaire_--von gran mistake!\"\n\n\"I hope not. I don't think you have thrown your money away in the\n_land_.\"\n\n\"No, sare; but I tro it avay in de _vatare!_\"\n\n\"That's not my fault.\"\n\n\"Yes, sare, but it is your fault. You're von ver gran rascal to\nswindle me out of _de l'argent_.\"\n\n\"Hello, old Poopoo, you grow personal; and if you can't keep a civil\ntongue in your head, you must go out of my counting-room.\"\n\n\"Vare shall I go to, eh?\"\n\n\"To the devil, for aught I care, you foolish old Frenchman!\" said the\nauctioneer, waxing warm.\n\n\"But, sare, I vill not go to de devil to oblige you!\" replied the\nFrenchman, waxing warmer. \"You sheat me out of all de dollar vot I\nmake in Shatham Street; but I vill not go to de devil for all dat. I\nvish you may go to de devil yourself you dem yankee-doo-dell, and I\nvill go and drown myself, _tout de suite_, right avay.\"\n\n\"You couldn't make a better use of your water privileges, old boy!\"\n\n\"Ah, _misericorde!_ Ah, _mon dieu, je suis abime_. I am ruin! I am\ndone up! I am break all into ten sousan leetle pieces! I am von lame\nduck, and I shall vaddle across de gran ocean for Paris, vish is de\nonly valuarble vatare privalege dat is left me _a present!_\"\n\nPoor Poopoo was as good as his word. He sailed in the next packet, and\narrived in Paris almost as penniless as the day he left it.\n\nShould any one feel disposed to doubt the veritable circumstances here\nrecorded, let him cross the East River to the Wallabout, and farmer\nJ---- will _row him out_ to the very place where the poor Frenchman's\nlots still remain _under water_.\n\n\n\nTHE ANGEL OF THE ODD\n\n[From _The Columbian Magazine_, October, 1844.]\n\nBY EDGAR ALLAN POE (1809-1849)\n\nIt was a chilly November afternoon. I had just consummated an\nunusually hearty dinner, of which the dyspeptic _truffe_ formed not\nthe least important item, and was sitting alone in the dining-room\nwith my feet upon the fender and at my elbow a small table which I had\nrolled up to the fire, and upon which were some apologies for dessert,\nwith some miscellaneous bottles of wine, spirit, and _liqueur_. In the\nmorning I had been reading Glover's _Leonidas_, Wilkie's _Epigoniad_,\nLamartine's _Pilgrimage_, Barlow's _Columbiad_, Tuckerman's _Sicily_,\nand Griswold's _Curiosities_, I am willing to confess, therefore, that\nI now felt a little stupid. I made effort to arouse myself by frequent\naid of Lafitte, and all failing, I betook myself to a stray newspaper\nin despair. Having carefully perused the column of \"Houses to let,\"\nand the column of \"Dogs lost,\" and then the columns of \"Wives and\napprentices runaway,\" I attacked with great resolution the editorial\nmatter, and reading it from beginning to end without understanding a\nsyllable, conceived the possibility of its being Chinese, and so\nre-read it from the end to the beginning, but with no more\nsatisfactory result. I was about throwing away in disgust\n\n  This folio of four pages, happy work\n  Which not even critics criticise,\n\nwhen I felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which\nfollows:\n\n\"The avenues to death are numerous and strange. A London paper\nmentions the decease of a person from a singular cause. He was playing\nat 'puff the dart,' which is played with a long needle inserted in\nsome worsted, and blown at a target through a tin tube. He placed the\nneedle at the wrong end of the tube, and drawing his breath strongly\nto puff the dart forward with force, drew the needle into his throat.\nIt entered the lungs, and in a few days killed him.\"\n\nUpon seeing this I fell into a great rage, without exactly knowing\nwhy. \"This thing,\" I exclaimed, \"is a contemptible falsehood--a poor\nhoax--the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner, of\nsome wretched concocter of accidents in Cocaigne. These fellows\nknowing the extravagant gullibility of the age set their wits to work\nin the imagination of improbable possibilities, of odd accidents as\nthey term them, but to a reflecting intellect (like mine, I added, in\nparenthesis, putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my\nnose), to a contemplative understanding such as I myself possess, it\nseems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these\n'odd accidents' is by far the oddest accident of all. For my own part,\nI intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the\n'singular' about it.\"\n\n\"Mein Gott, den, vat a vool you bees for dat!\" replied one of the most\nremarkable voices I ever heard. At first I took it for a rumbling in\nmy ears--such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very\ndrunk--but upon second thought, I considered the sound as more nearly\nresembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big\nstick; and, in fact, this I should have concluded it to be, but for\nthe articulation of the syllables and words. I am by no means\nnaturally nervous, and the very few glasses of Lafitte which I had\nsipped served to embolden me a little, so that I felt nothing of\ntrepidation, but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement and\nlooked carefully around the room for the intruder. I could not,\nhowever, perceive any one at all.\n\n\"Humph!\" resumed the voice as I continued my survey, \"you mus pe so\ndronk as de pig den for not zee me as I zit here at your zide.\"\n\nHereupon I bethought me of looking immediately before my nose, and\nthere, sure enough, confronting me at the table sat a personage\nnondescript, although not altogether indescribable. His body was a\nwine-pipe or a rum puncheon, or something of that character, and had a\ntruly Falstaffian air. In its nether extremity were inserted two kegs,\nwhich seemed to answer all the purposes of legs. For arms there\ndangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long\nbottles with the necks outward for hands. All the head that I saw the\nmonster possessed of was one of those Hessian canteens which resemble\na large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid. This canteen\n(with a funnel on its top like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes)\nwas set on edge upon the puncheon, with the hole toward myself; and\nthrough this hole, which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very\nprecise old maid, the creature was emitting certain rumbling and\ngrumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk.\n\n\"I zay,\" said he, \"you mos pe dronk as de pig, vor zit dare and not\nzee me zit ere; and I zay, doo, you mos pe pigger vool as de goose,\nvor to dispelief vat iz print in de print. 'Tiz de troof--dat it\niz--ebery vord ob it.\"\n\n\"Who are you, pray?\" said I with much dignity, although somewhat\npuzzled; \"how did you get here? and what is it you are talking about?\"\n\n\"As vor ow I com'd ere,\" replied the figure, \"dat iz none of your\npizziness; and as vor vat I be talking apout, I be talk apout vat I\ntink proper; and as vor who I be, vy dat is de very ting I com'd here\nfor to let you zee for yourself.\"\n\n\"You are a drunken vagabond,\" said I, \"and I shall ring the bell and\norder my footman to kick you into the street.\"\n\n\"He! he! he!\" said the fellow, \"hu! hu! hu! dat you can't do.\"\n\n\"Can't do!\" said I, \"what do you mean? I can't do what?\"\n\n\"Ring de pell,\" he replied, attempting a grin with his little\nvillainous mouth.\n\nUpon this I made an effort to get up in order to put my threat into\nexecution, but the ruffian just reached across the table very\ndeliberately, and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of\none of the long bottles, knocked me back into the armchair from which\nI had half arisen. I was utterly astounded, and for a moment was quite\nat a loss what to do. In the meantime he continued his talk.\n\n\"You zee,\" said he, \"it iz te bess vor zit still; and now you shall\nknow who I pe. Look at me! zee! I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.\"\n\n\"And odd enough, too,\" I ventured to reply; \"but I was always under\nthe impression that an angel had wings.\"\n\n\"Te wing!\" he cried, highly incensed, \"vat I pe do mit te wing? Mein\nGott! do you take me for a shicken?\"\n\n\"No--oh, no!\" I replied, much alarmed; \"you are no chicken--certainly\nnot.\"\n\n\"Well, den, zit still and pehabe yourself, or I'll rap you again mid\nme vist. It iz te shicken ab te wing, und te owl ab te wing, und te\nimp ab te wing, und te head-teuffel ab te wing. Te angel ab _not_ te\nwing, and I am te _Angel ov te Odd_.\"\n\n\"And your business with me at present is--is----\"\n\n\"My pizziness!\" ejaculated the thing, \"vy vat a low-bred puppy you mos\npe vor to ask a gentleman und an angel apout his pizziness!\"\n\nThis language was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel;\nso, plucking up courage, I seized a salt-cellar which lay within\nreach, and hurled it at the head of the intruder. Either he dodged,\nhowever, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the\ndemolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon\nthe mantelpiece. As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault\nby giving me two or three hard, consecutive raps upon the forehead as\nbefore. These reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost\nashamed to confess that, either through pain or vexation, there came a\nfew tears into my eyes.\n\n\"Mein Gott!\" said the Angel of the Odd, apparently much softened at my\ndistress; \"mein Gott, te man is eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry. You\nmos not trink it so strong--you mos put te water in te wine. Here,\ntrink dis, like a good veller, and don't gry now--don't!\"\n\nHereupon the Angel of the Odd replenished my goblet (which was about a\nthird full of port) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of\nhis hand-bottles. I observed that these bottles had labels about their\nnecks, and that these labels were inscribed \"Kirschenwaesser.\"\n\nThe considerate kindness of the Angel mollified me in no little\nmeasure; and, aided by the water with which he diluted my port more\nthan once, I at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his\nvery extraordinary discourse. I cannot pretend to recount all that he\ntold me, but I gleaned from what he said that he was a genius who\npresided over the _contretemps_ of mankind, and whose business it was\nto bring about the _odd accidents_ which are continually astonishing\nthe skeptic. Once or twice, upon my venturing to express my total\nincredulity in respect to his pretensions, he grew very angry indeed,\nso that at length I considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at\nall, and let him have his own way. He talked on, therefore, at great\nlength, while I merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut, and\namused myself with munching raisins and filiping the stems about the\nroom. But, by and by, the Angel suddenly construed this behavior of\nmine into contempt. He arose in a terrible passion, slouched his\nfunnel down over his eyes, swore a vast oath, uttered a threat of some\ncharacter, which I did not precisely comprehend, and finally made me a\nlow bow and departed, wishing me, in the language of the archbishop in\n\"Gil Bias,\" _beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens_.\n\nHis departure afforded me relief. The _very_ few glasses of Lafitte\nthat I had sipped had the effect of rendering me drowsy, and I felt\ninclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as is my\ncustom after dinner. At six I had an appointment of consequence, which\nit was quite indispensable that I should keep. The policy of insurance\nfor my dwelling-house had expired the day before; and some dispute\nhaving arisen it was agreed that, at six, I should meet the board of\ndirectors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal. Glancing\nupward at the clock on the mantelpiece (for I felt too drowsy to take\nout my watch), I had the pleasure to find that I had still twenty-five\nminutes to spare. It was half-past five; I could easily walk to the\ninsurance office in five minutes; and my usual siestas had never been\nknown to exceed five-and-twenty. I felt sufficiently safe, therefore,\nand composed myself to my slumbers forthwith.\n\nHaving completed them to my satisfaction, I again looked toward the\ntimepiece, and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd\naccidents when I found that, instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty\nminutes, I had been dozing only three; for it still wanted\nseven-and-twenty of the appointed hour. I betook myself again to my\nnap, and at length a second time awoke, when, to my utter amazement,\nit still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six. I jumped up to examine\nthe clock, and found that it had ceased running. My watch informed me\nthat it was half-past seven; and, of course, having slept two hours, I\nwas too late for my appointment. \"It will make no difference,\" I said:\n\"I can call at the office in the morning and apologize; in the\nmeantime what can be the matter with the clock?\" Upon examining it I\ndiscovered that one of the raisin stems which I had been filiping\nabout the room during the discourse of the Angel of the Odd had flown\nthrough the fractured crystal, and lodging, singularly enough, in the\nkeyhole, with an end projecting outward, had thus arrested the\nrevolution of the minute hand.\n\n\"Ah!\" said I, \"I see how it is. This thing speaks for itself. A\nnatural accident, such as will happen now and then!\"\n\nI gave the matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour\nretired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading stand at\nthe bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the\n_Omnipresence of the Deity_, I unfortunately fell asleep in less than\ntwenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.\n\nMy dreams were terrifically disturbed by visions of the Angel of the\nOdd. Methought he stood at the foot of the couch, drew aside the\ncurtains, and in the hollow, detestable tones of a rum puncheon,\nmenaced me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which I\nhad treated him. He concluded a long harangue by taking off his\nfunnel-cap, inserting the tube into my gullet, and thus deluging me\nwith an ocean of Kirschenwaesser, which he poured in a continuous\nflood, from one of the long-necked bottles that stood him instead of\nan arm. My agony was at length insufferable, and I awoke just in time\nto perceive that a rat had run off with the lighted candle from the\nstand, but _not_ in season to prevent his making his escape with it\nthrough the hole, Very soon a strong, suffocating odor assailed my\nnostrils; the house, I clearly perceived, was on fire. In a few\nminutes the blaze broke forth with violence, and in an incredibly\nbrief period the entire building was wrapped in flames. All egress\nfrom my chamber, except through a window, was cut off. The crowd,\nhowever, quickly procured and raised a long ladder. By means of this I\nwas descending rapidly, and in apparent safety, when a huge hog, about\nwhose rotund stomach, and indeed about whose whole air and\nphysiognomy, there was something which reminded me of the Angel of the\nOdd--when this hog, I say, which hitherto had been quietly slumbering\nin the mud, took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder\nneeded scratching, and could find no more convenient rubbing-post than\nthat afforded by the foot of the ladder. In an instant I was\nprecipitated, and had the misfortune to fracture my arm.\n\nThis accident, with the loss of my insurance, and with the more\nserious loss of my hair, the whole of which had been singed off by the\nfire, predisposed me to serious impressions, so that finally I made up\nmy mind to take a wife. There was a rich widow disconsolate for the\nloss of her seventh husband, and to her wounded spirit I offered the\nbalm of my vows. She yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers. I\nknelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration. She blushed and bowed\nher luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me\ntemporarily by Grandjean. I know not how the entanglement took place\nbut so it was. I arose with a shining pate, wigless; she in disdain\nand wrath, half-buried in alien hair. Thus ended my hopes of the widow\nby an accident which could not have been anticipated, to be sure, but\nwhich the natural sequence of events had brought about.\n\nWithout despairing, however, I undertook the siege of a less\nimplacable heart. The fates were again propitious for a brief period,\nbut again a trivial incident interfered. Meeting my betrothed in an\navenue thronged with the elite of the city, I was hastening to greet\nher with one of my best considered bows, when a small particle of some\nforeign matter lodging in the corner of my eye rendered me for the\nmoment completely blind. Before I could recover my sight, the lady of\nmy love had disappeared--irreparably affronted at what she chose to\nconsider my premeditated rudeness in passing her by ungreeted. While I\nstood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident (which might have\nhappened, nevertheless, to any one under the sun), and while I still\ncontinued incapable of sight, I was accosted by the Angel of the Odd,\nwho proffered me his aid with a civility which I had no reason to\nexpect. He examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill,\ninformed me that I had a drop in it, and (whatever a \"drop\" was) took\nit out, and afforded me relief.\n\nI now considered it high time to die (since fortune had so determined\nto persecute me), and accordingly made my way to the nearest river.\nHere, divesting myself of my clothes (for there is no reason why we\ncannot die as we were born), I threw myself headlong into the current;\nthe sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been\nseduced into the eating of brandy-saturated corn, and so had staggered\naway from his fellows. No sooner had I entered the water than this\nbird took it into his head to fly away with the most indispensable\nportion of my apparel. Postponing, therefore, for the present, my\nsuicidal design, I just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves\nof my coat, and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the\nnimbleness which the case required and its circumstances would admit.\nBut my evil destiny attended me still. As I ran at full speed, with my\nnose up in the atmosphere, and intent only upon the purloiner of my\nproperty, I suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon\n_terra firma_; the fact is, I had thrown myself over a precipice, and\nshould inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune\nin grasping the end of a long guide-rope, which depended from a\npassing balloon.\n\nAs soon as I sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the\nterrific predicament in which I stood, or rather hung, I exerted all\nthe power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the aeronaut\noverhead. But for a long time I exerted myself in vain. Either the\nfool could not, or the villain would not perceive me. Meanwhile the\nmachine rapidly soared, while my strength even more rapidly failed. I\nwas soon upon the point of resigning myself to my fate, and dropping\nquietly into the sea, when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing\na hollow voice from above, which seemed to be lazily humming an opera\nair. Looking up, I perceived the Angel of the Odd. He was leaning,\nwith his arms folded, over the rim of the car; and with a pipe in his\nmouth, at which he puffed leisurely, seemed to be upon excellent terms\nwith himself and the universe. I was too much exhausted to speak, so I\nmerely regarded him with an imploring air.\n\nFor several minutes, although he looked me full in the face, he said\nnothing. At length, removing carefully his meerschaum from the right\nto the left corner of his mouth, he condescended to speak.\n\n\"Who pe you,\" he asked, \"und what der teuffel you pe do dare?\"\n\nTo this piece of impudence, cruelty, and affectation, I could reply\nonly by ejaculating the monosyllable \"Help!\"\n\n\"Elp!\" echoed the ruffian, \"not I. Dare iz te pottle--elp yourself,\nund pe tam'd!\"\n\nWith these words he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwaesser, which,\ndropping precisely upon the crown of my head, caused me to imagine\nthat my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with this idea I\nwas about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good\ngrace, when I was arrested by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold\non.\n\n\"'Old on!\" he said: \"don't pe in te 'urry--don't. Will you pe take de\nodder pottle, or 'ave you pe got zober yet, and come to your zenzes?\"\n\nI made haste, hereupon, to nod my head twice--once in the negative,\nmeaning thereby that I would prefer not taking the other bottle at\npresent; and once in the affirmative, intending thus to imply that I\n_was_ sober and _had_ positively come to my senses. By these means I\nsomewhat softened the Angel.\n\n\"Und you pelief, ten,\" he inquired, \"at te last? You pelief, ten, in\nte possibility of te odd?\"\n\nI again nodded my head in assent.\n\n\"Und you ave pelief in _me_, te Angel of te Odd?\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"Und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk und te vool?\"\n\nI nodded once more.\n\n\"Put your right hand into your left preeches pocket, ten, in token ov\nyour vull zubmizzion unto te Angel ov te Odd.\"\n\nThis thing, for very obvious reasons, I found it quite impossible to\ndo. In the first place, my left arm had been broken in my fall from\nthe ladder, and therefore, had I let go my hold with the right hand I\nmust have let go altogether. In the second place, I could have no\nbreeches until I came across the crow. I was therefore obliged, much\nto my regret, to shake my head in the negative, intending thus to give\nthe Angel to understand that I found it inconvenient, just at that\nmoment, to comply with his very reasonable demand! No sooner, however,\nhad I ceased shaking my head than--\n\n\"Go to der teuffel, ten!\" roared the Angel of the Odd.\n\nIn pronouncing these words he drew a sharp knife across the guide-rope\nby which I was suspended, and as we then happened to be precisely over\nmy own house (which, during my peregrinations, had been handsomely\nrebuilt), it so occurred that I tumbled headlong down the ample\nchimney and alit upon the dining-room hearth.\n\nUpon coming to my senses (for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me)\nI found it about four o'clock in the morning. I lay outstretched where\nI had fallen from the balloon. My head groveled in the ashes of an\nextinguished fire, while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small\ntable, overthrown, and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert,\nintermingled with a newspaper, some broken glasses and shattered\nbottles, and an empty jug of the Schiedam Kirschenwaesser. Thus\nrevenged himself the Angel of the Odd.\n\n\n\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER'S PROGRESS\n\nBy Caroline M.S. Kirkland (1801-1864)\n\n[From _The Gift_ for 1845, published late in 1844. Republished in the\nvolume, _Western Clearings_ (1845), by Caroline M.S. Kirkland.]\n\nMaster William Horner came to our village to school when he was about\neighteen years old: tall, lank, straight-sided, and straight-haired,\nwith a mouth of the most puckered and solemn kind. His figure and\nmovements were those of a puppet cut out of shingle and jerked by a\nstring; and his address corresponded very well with his appearance.\nNever did that prim mouth give way before a laugh. A faint and misty\nsmile was the widest departure from its propriety, and this\nunaccustomed disturbance made wrinkles in the flat, skinny cheeks like\nthose in the surface of a lake, after the intrusion of a stone. Master\nHorner knew well what belonged to the pedagogical character, and that\nfacial solemnity stood high on the list of indispensable\nqualifications. He had made up his mind before he left his father's\nhouse how he would look during the term. He had not planned any smiles\n(knowing that he must \"board round\"), and it was not for ordinary\noccurrences to alter his arrangements; so that when he was betrayed\ninto a relaxation of the muscles, it was \"in such a sort\" as if he was\nputting his bread and butter in jeopardy.\n\nTruly he had a grave time that first winter. The rod of power was new\nto him, and he felt it his \"duty\" to use it more frequently than might\nhave been thought necessary by those upon whose sense the privilege\nhad palled. Tears and sulky faces, and impotent fists doubled fiercely\nwhen his back was turned, were the rewards of his conscientiousness;\nand the boys--and girls too--were glad when working time came round\nagain, and the master went home to help his father on the farm.\n\nBut with the autumn came Master Horner again, dropping among us as\nquietly as the faded leaves, and awakening at least as much serious\nreflection. Would he be as self-sacrificing as before, postponing his\nown ease and comfort to the public good, or would he have become more\nsedentary, and less fond of circumambulating the school-room with a\nswitch over his shoulder? Many were fain to hope he might have learned\nto smoke during the summer, an accomplishment which would probably\nhave moderated his energy not a little, and disposed him rather to\nreverie than to action. But here he was, and all the broader-chested\nand stouter-armed for his labors in the harvest-field.\n\nLet it not be supposed that Master Horner was of a cruel and ogrish\nnature--a babe-eater--a Herod--one who delighted in torturing the\nhelpless. Such souls there may be, among those endowed with the awful\ncontrol of the ferule, but they are rare in the fresh and natural\nregions we describe. It is, we believe, where young gentlemen are to\nbe crammed for college, that the process of hardening heart and skin\ntogether goes on most vigorously. Yet among the uneducated there is so\nhigh a respect for bodily strength, that it is necessary for the\nschoolmaster to show, first of all, that he possesses this\ninadmissible requisite for his place. The rest is more readily taken\nfor granted. Brains he _may_ have--a strong arm he _must_ have: so he\nproves the more important claim first. We must therefore make all due\nallowance for Master Horner, who could not be expected to overtop his\nposition so far as to discern at once the philosophy of teaching.\n\nHe was sadly brow-beaten during his first term of service by a great\nbroad-shouldered lout of some eighteen years or so, who thought he\nneeded a little more \"schooling,\" but at the same time felt quite\ncompetent to direct the manner and measure of his attempts.\n\n\"You'd ought to begin with large-hand, Joshuay,\" said Master Horner to\nthis youth.\n\n\"What should I want coarse-hand for?\" said the disciple, with great\ncontempt; \"coarse-hand won't never do me no good. I want a fine-hand\ncopy.\"\n\nThe master looked at the infant giant, and did as he wished, but we\nsay not with what secret resolutions.\n\nAt another time, Master Horner, having had a hint from some one more\nknowing than himself, proposed to his elder scholars to write after\ndictation, expatiating at the same time quite floridly (the ideas\nhaving been supplied by the knowing friend), upon the advantages\nlikely to arise from this practice, and saying, among other things,\n\n\"It will help you, when you write letters, to spell the words good.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Joshua, \"spellin' ain't nothin'; let them that finds the\nmistakes correct 'em. I'm for every one's havin' a way of their own.\"\n\n\"How dared you be so saucy to the master?\" asked one of the little\nboys, after school.\n\n\"Because I could lick him, easy,\" said the hopeful Joshua, who knew\nvery well why the master did not undertake him on the spot.\n\nCan we wonder that Master Horner determined to make his empire good as\nfar as it went?\n\nA new examination was required on the entrance into a second term,\nand, with whatever secret trepidation, the master was obliged to\nsubmit. Our law prescribes examinations, but forgets to provide for\nthe competency of the examiners; so that few better farces offer than\nthe course of question and answer on these occasions. We know not\nprecisely what were Master Horner's trials; but we have heard of a\nsharp dispute between the inspectors whether a-n-g-e-l spelt _angle_\nor _angel_. _Angle_ had it, and the school maintained that\npronunciation ever after. Master Horner passed, and he was requested\nto draw up the certificate for the inspectors to sign, as one had left\nhis spectacles at home, and the other had a bad cold, so that it was\nnot convenient for either to write more than his name. Master Homer's\nexhibition of learning on this occasion did not reach us, but we know\nthat it must have been considerable, since he stood the ordeal.\n\n\"What is orthography?\" said an inspector once, in our presence.\n\nThe candidate writhed a good deal, studied the beams overhead and the\nchickens out of the window, and then replied,\n\n\"It is so long since I learnt the first part of the spelling-book,\nthat I can't justly answer that question. But if I could just look it\nover, I guess I could.\"\n\nOur schoolmaster entered upon his second term with new courage and\ninvigorated authority. Twice certified, who should dare doubt his\ncompetency? Even Joshua was civil, and lesser louts of course\nobsequious; though the girls took more liberties, for they feel even\nat that early age, that influence is stronger than strength.\n\nCould a young schoolmaster think of feruling a girl with her hair in\nringlets and a gold ring on her finger? Impossible--and the immunity\nextended to all the little sisters and cousins; and there were enough\nlarge girls to protect all the feminine part of the school. With the\nboys Master Horner still had many a battle, and whether with a view to\nthis, or as an economical ruse, he never wore his coat in school,\nsaying it was too warm. Perhaps it was an astute attention to the\nprejudices of his employers, who love no man that does not earn his\nliving by the sweat of his brow. The shirt-sleeves gave the idea of a\nmanual-labor school in one sense at least. It was evident that the\nmaster worked, and that afforded a probability that the scholars\nworked too.\n\nMaster Horner's success was most triumphant that winter. A year's\ngrowth had improved his outward man exceedingly, filling out the limbs\nso that they did not remind you so forcibly of a young colt's, and\nsupplying the cheeks with the flesh and blood so necessary where\nmustaches were not worn. Experience had given him a degree of\nconfidence, and confidence gave him power. In short, people said the\nmaster had waked up; and so he had. He actually set about reading for\nimprovement; and although at the end of the term he could not quite\nmake out from his historical studies which side Hannibal was on, yet\nthis is readily explained by the fact that he boarded round, and was\nobliged to read generally by firelight, surrounded by ungoverned\nchildren.\n\nAfter this, Master Horner made his own bargain. When schooltime came\nround with the following autumn, and the teacher presented himself for\na third examination, such a test was pronounced no longer necessary;\nand the district consented to engage him at the astounding rate of\nsixteen dollars a month, with the understanding that he was to have a\nfixed home, provided he was willing to allow a dollar a week for it.\nMaster Horner bethought him of the successive \"killing-times,\" and\nconsequent doughnuts of the twenty families in which he had sojourned\nthe years before, and consented to the exaction.\n\nBehold our friend now as high as district teacher can ever hope to\nbe--his scholarship established, his home stationary and not\nrevolving, and the good behavior of the community insured by the fact\nthat he, being of age, had now a farm to retire upon in case of any\ndisgust.\n\nMaster Horner was at once the preeminent beau of the neighborhood,\nspite of the prejudice against learning. He brushed his hair straight\nup in front, and wore a sky-blue ribbon for a guard to his silver\nwatch, and walked as if the tall heels of his blunt boots were\negg-shells and not leather. Yet he was far from neglecting the duties\nof his place. He was beau only on Sundays and holidays; very\nschoolmaster the rest of the time.\n\nIt was at a \"spelling-school\" that Master Horner first met the\neducated eyes of Miss Harriet Bangle, a young lady visiting the\nEngleharts in our neighborhood. She was from one of the towns in\nWestern New York, and had brought with her a variety of city airs and\ngraces somewhat caricatured, set off with year-old French fashions\nmuch travestied. Whether she had been sent out to the new country to\ntry, somewhat late, a rustic chance for an establishment, or whether\nher company had been found rather trying at home, we cannot say. The\nview which she was at some pains to make understood was, that her\nfriends had contrived this method of keeping her out of the way of a\ndesperate lover whose addresses were not acceptable to them.\n\nIf it should seem surprising that so high-bred a visitor should be\nsojourning in the wild woods, it must be remembered that more than one\ncelebrated Englishman and not a few distinguished Americans have\nfarmer brothers in the western country, no whit less rustic in their\nexterior and manner of life than the plainest of their neighbors. When\nthese are visited by their refined kinsfolk, we of the woods catch\nglimpses of the gay world, or think we do.\n\n  That great medicine hath\n  With its tinct gilded--\n\nmany a vulgarism to the satisfaction of wiser heads than ours.\n\nMiss Bangle's manner bespoke for her that high consideration which she\nfelt to be her due. Yet she condescended to be amused by the rustics\nand their awkward attempts at gaiety and elegance; and, to say truth,\nfew of the village merry-makings escaped her, though she wore always\nthe air of great superiority.\n\nThe spelling-school is one of the ordinary winter amusements in the\ncountry. It occurs once in a fortnight, or so, and has power to draw\nout all the young people for miles round, arrayed in their best\nclothes and their holiday behavior. When all is ready, umpires are\nelected, and after these have taken the distinguished place usually\noccupied by the teacher, the young people of the school choose the two\nbest scholars to head the opposing classes. These leaders choose their\nfollowers from the mass, each calling a name in turn, until all the\nspellers are ranked on one side or the other, lining the sides of the\nroom, and all standing. The schoolmaster, standing too, takes his\nspelling-book, and gives a placid yet awe-inspiring look along the\nranks, remarking that he intends to be very impartial, and that he\nshall give out nothing _that is not in the spelling-book_. For the\nfirst half hour or so he chooses common and easy words, that the\nspirit of the evening may not be damped by the too early thinning of\nthe classes. When a word is missed, the blunderer has to sit down, and\nbe a spectator only for the rest of the evening. At certain intervals,\nsome of the best speakers mount the platform, and \"speak a piece,\"\nwhich is generally as declamatory as possible.\n\nThe excitement of this scene is equal to that afforded by any city\nspectacle whatever; and towards the close of the evening, when\ndifficult and unusual words are chosen to confound the small number\nwho still keep the floor, it becomes scarcely less than painful. When\nperhaps only one or two remain to be puzzled, the master, weary at\nlast of his task, though a favorite one, tries by tricks to put down\nthose whom he cannot overcome in fair fight. If among all the curious,\nuseless, unheard-of words which may be picked out of the\nspelling-book, he cannot find one which the scholars have not noticed,\nhe gets the last head down by some quip or catch. \"Bay\" will perhaps\nbe the sound; one scholar spells it \"bey,\" another, \"bay,\" while the\nmaster all the time means \"ba,\" which comes within the rule, being _in\nthe spelling-book_.\n\nIt was on one of these occasions, as we have said, that Miss Bangle,\nhaving come to the spelling-school to get materials for a letter to a\nfemale friend, first shone upon Mr. Horner. She was excessively amused\nby his solemn air and puckered mouth, and set him down at once as fair\ngame. Yet she could not help becoming somewhat interested in the\nspelling-school, and after it was over found she had not stored up\nhalf as many of the schoolmaster's points as she intended, for the\nbenefit of her correspondent.\n\nIn the evening's contest a young girl from some few miles' distance,\nEllen Kingsbury, the only child of a substantial farmer, had been the\nvery last to sit down, after a prolonged effort on the part of Mr.\nHorner to puzzle her, for the credit of his own school. She blushed,\nand smiled, and blushed again, but spelt on, until Mr. Horner's cheeks\nwere crimson with excitement and some touch of shame that he should be\nbaffled at his own weapons. At length, either by accident or design,\nEllen missed a word, and sinking into her seat was numbered with the\nslain.\n\nIn the laugh and talk which followed (for with the conclusion of the\nspelling, all form of a public assembly vanishes), our schoolmaster\nsaid so many gallant things to his fair enemy, and appeared so much\nanimated by the excitement of the contest, that Miss Bangle began to\nlook upon him with rather more respect, and to feel somewhat indignant\nthat a little rustic like Ellen should absorb the entire attention of\nthe only beau. She put on, therefore, her most gracious aspect, and\nmingled in the circle; caused the schoolmaster to be presented to her,\nand did her best to fascinate him by certain airs and graces which she\nhad found successful elsewhere. What game is too small for the\nclose-woven net of a coquette?\n\nMr. Horner quitted not the fair Ellen until he had handed her into her\nfather's sleigh; and he then wended his way homewards, never thinking\nthat he ought to have escorted Miss Bangle to her uncle's, though she\ncertainly waited a little while for his return.\n\nWe must not follow into particulars the subsequent intercourse of our\nschoolmaster with the civilized young lady. All that concerns us is\nthe result of Miss Bangle's benevolent designs upon his heart. She\ntried most sincerely to find its vulnerable spot, meaning no doubt to\nput Mr. Homer on his guard for the future; and she was unfeignedly\nsurprised to discover that her best efforts were of no avail. She\nconcluded he must have taken a counter-poison, and she was not slow in\nguessing its source. She had observed the peculiar fire which lighted\nup his eyes in the presence of Ellen Kingsbury, and she bethought her\nof a plan which would ensure her some amusement at the expense of\nthese impertinent rustics, though in a manner different somewhat from\nher original more natural idea of simple coquetry.\n\nA letter was written to Master Horner, purporting to come from Ellen\nKingsbury, worded so artfully that the schoolmaster understood at once\nthat it was intended to be a secret communication, though its\nostensible object was an inquiry about some ordinary affair. This was\nlaid in Mr. Horner's desk before he came to school, with an intimation\nthat he might leave an answer in a certain spot on the following\nmorning. The bait took at once, for Mr. Horner, honest and true\nhimself, and much smitten with the fair Ellen, was too happy to be\ncircumspect. The answer was duly placed, and as duly carried to Miss\nBangle by her accomplice, Joe Englehart, an unlucky pickle who \"was\nalways for ill, never for good,\" and who found no difficulty in\nobtaining the letter unwatched, since the master was obliged to be in\nschool at nine, and Joe could always linger a few minutes later. This\nanswer being opened and laughed at, Miss Bangle had only to contrive a\nrejoinder, which being rather more particular in its tone than the\noriginal communication, led on yet again the happy schoolmaster, who\nbranched out into sentiment, \"taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,\"\ntalked of hills and dales and rivulets, and the pleasures of\nfriendship, and concluded by entreating a continuance of the\ncorrespondence.\n\nAnother letter and another, every one more flattering and encouraging\nthan the last, almost turned the sober head of our poor master, and\nwarmed up his heart so effectually that he could scarcely attend to\nhis business. The spelling-schools were remembered, however, and Ellen\nKingsbury made one of the merry company; but the latest letter had not\nforgotten to caution Mr. Horner not to betray the intimacy; so that he\nwas in honor bound to restrict himself to the language of the eyes\nhard as it was to forbear the single whisper for which he would have\ngiven his very dictionary. So, their meeting passed off without the\nexplanation which Miss Bangle began to fear would cut short her\nbenevolent amusement.\n\nThe correspondence was resumed with renewed spirit, and carried on\nuntil Miss Bangle, though not overburdened with sensitiveness, began\nto be a little alarmed for the consequences of her malicious\npleasantry. She perceived that she herself had turned schoolmistress,\nand that Master Horner, instead of being merely her dupe, had become\nher pupil too; for the style of his replies had been constantly\nimproving and the earnest and manly tone which he assumed promised any\nthing but the quiet, sheepish pocketing of injury and insult, upon\nwhich she had counted. In truth, there was something deeper than\nvanity in the feelings with which he regarded Ellen Kingsbury. The\nencouragement which he supposed himself to have received, threw down\nthe barrier which his extreme bashfulness would have interposed\nbetween himself and any one who possessed charms enough to attract\nhim; and we must excuse him if, in such a case, he did not criticise\nthe mode of encouragement, but rather grasped eagerly the proffered\ngood without a scruple, or one which he would own to himself, as to\nthe propriety with which it was tendered. He was as much in love as a\nman can be, and the seriousness of real attachment gave both grace and\ndignity to his once awkward diction.\n\nThe evident determination of Mr. Horner to come to the point of asking\npapa brought Miss Bangle to a very awkward pass. She had expected to\nreturn home before matters had proceeded so far, but being obliged to\nremain some time longer, she was equally afraid to go on and to leave\noff, a _denouement_ being almost certain to ensue in either case.\nThings stood thus when it was time to prepare for the grand exhibition\nwhich was to close the winter's term.\n\nThis is an affair of too much magnitude to be fully described in the\nsmall space yet remaining in which to bring out our veracious history.\nIt must be \"slubber'd o'er in haste\"--its important preliminaries left\nto the cold imagination of the reader--its fine spirit perhaps\nevaporating for want of being embodied in words. We can only say that\nour master, whose school-life was to close with the term, labored as\nman never before labored in such a cause, resolute to trail a cloud of\nglory after him when he left us. Not a candlestick nor a curtain that\nwas attainable, either by coaxing or bribery, was left in the village;\neven the only piano, that frail treasure, was wiled away and placed in\none corner of the rickety stage. The most splendid of all the pieces\nin the _Columbian Orator_, the _American Speaker_, the----but we must\nnot enumerate--in a word, the most astounding and pathetic specimens\nof eloquence within ken of either teacher or scholars, had been\nselected for the occasion; and several young ladies and gentlemen,\nwhose academical course had been happily concluded at an earlier\nperiod, either at our own institution or at some other, had consented\nto lend themselves to the parts, and their choicest decorations for\nthe properties, of the dramatic portion of the entertainment.\n\nAmong these last was pretty Ellen Kingsbury, who had agreed to\npersonate the Queen of Scots, in the garden scene from Schiller's\ntragedy of _Mary Stuart_; and this circumstance accidentally afforded\nMaster Horner the opportunity he had so long desired, of seeing his\nfascinating correspondent without the presence of peering eyes. A\ndress-rehearsal occupied the afternoon before the day of days, and the\npathetic expostulations of the lovely Mary--\n\n  Mine all doth hang--my life--my destiny--\n  Upon my words--upon the force of tears!--\n\naided by the long veil, and the emotion which sympathy brought into\nEllen's countenance, proved too much for the enforced prudence of\nMaster Horner. When the rehearsal was over, and the heroes and\nheroines were to return home, it was found that, by a stroke of witty\ninvention not new in the country, the harness of Mr. Kingsbury's\nhorses had been cut in several places, his whip hidden, his\nbuffalo-skins spread on the ground, and the sleigh turned bottom\nupwards on them. This afforded an excuse for the master's borrowing a\nhorse and sleigh of somebody, and claiming the privilege of taking\nMiss Ellen home, while her father returned with only Aunt Sally and a\ngreat bag of bran from the mill--companions about equally interesting.\n\nHere, then, was the golden opportunity so long wished for! Here was\nthe power of ascertaining at once what is never quite certain until we\nhave heard it from warm, living lips, whose testimony is strengthened\nby glances in which the whole soul speaks or--seems to speak. The time\nwas short, for the sleighing was but too fine; and Father Kingsbury,\nhaving tied up his harness, and collected his scattered equipment, was\ndriving so close behind that there was no possibility of lingering for\na moment. Yet many moments were lost before Mr. Horner, very much in\nearnest, and all unhackneyed in matters of this sort, could find a\nword in which to clothe his new-found feelings. The horse seemed to\nfly--the distance was half past--and at length, in absolute despair of\nanything better, he blurted out at once what he had determined to\navoid--a direct reference to the correspondence.\n\nA game at cross-purposes ensued; exclamations and explanations, and\ndenials and apologies filled up the time which was to have made Master\nHorner so blest. The light from Mr. Kingsbury's windows shone upon the\npath, and the whole result of this conference so longed for, was a\nburst of tears from the perplexed and mortified Ellen, who sprang from\nMr. Horner's attempts to detain her, rushed into the house without\nvouchsafing him a word of adieu, and left him standing, no bad\npersonification of Orpheus, after the last hopeless flitting of his\nEurydice.\n\n\"Won't you 'light, Master?\" said Mr. Kingsbury.\n\n\"Yes--no--thank you--good evening,\" stammered poor Master Horner, so\nstupefied that even Aunt Sally called him \"a dummy.\"\n\nThe horse took the sleigh against the fence, going home, and threw out\nthe master, who scarcely recollected the accident; while to Ellen the\nissue of this unfortunate drive was a sleepless night and so high a\nfever in the morning that our village doctor was called to Mr.\nKingsbury's before breakfast.\n\nPoor Master Horner's distress may hardly be imagined. Disappointed,\nbewildered, cut to the quick, yet as much in love as ever, he could\nonly in bitter silence turn over in his thoughts the issue of his\ncherished dream; now persuading himself that Ellen's denial was the\neffect of a sudden bashfulness, now inveighing against the fickleness\nof the sex, as all men do when they are angry with any one woman in\nparticular. But his exhibition must go on in spite of wretchedness;\nand he went about mechanically, talking of curtains and candles, and\nmusic, and attitudes, and pauses, and emphasis, looking like a\nsomnambulist whose \"eyes are open but their sense is shut,\" and often\nsurprising those concerned by the utter unfitness of his answers.\n\nIt was almost evening when Mr. Kingsbury, having discovered, through\nthe intervention of the Doctor and Aunt Sally the cause of Ellen's\ndistress, made his appearance before the unhappy eyes of Master\nHorner, angry, solemn and determined; taking the schoolmaster apart,\nand requiring, an explanation of his treatment of his daughter. In\nvain did the perplexed lover ask for time to clear himself, declare\nhis respect for Miss Ellen and his willingness to give every\nexplanation which she might require; the father was not to be put off;\nand though excessively reluctant, Mr. Horner had no resource but to\nshow the letters which alone could account for his strange discourse\nto Ellen. He unlocked his desk, slowly and unwillingly, while the old\nman's impatience was such that he could scarcely forbear thrusting in\nhis own hand to snatch at the papers which were to explain this\nvexatious mystery. What could equal the utter confusion of Master\nHorner and the contemptuous anger of the father, when no letters were\nto be found! Mr. Kingsbury was too passionate to listen to reason, or\nto reflect for one moment upon the irreproachable good name of the\nschoolmaster. He went away in inexorable wrath; threatening every\npracticable visitation of public and private justice upon the head of\nthe offender, whom he accused of having attempted to trick his\ndaughter into an entanglement which should result in his favor.\n\nA doleful exhibition was this last one of our thrice approved and most\nworthy teacher! Stern necessity and the power of habit enabled him to\ngo through with most of his part, but where was the proud fire which\nhad lighted up his eye on similar occasions before? He sat as one of\nthree judges before whom the unfortunate Robert Emmet was dragged in\nhis shirt-sleeves, by two fierce-looking officials; but the chief\njudge looked far more like a criminal than did the proper\nrepresentative. He ought to have personated Othello, but was obliged\nto excuse himself from raving for \"the handkerchief! the\nhandkerchief!\" on the rather anomalous plea of a bad cold. _Mary\nStuart_ being \"i' the bond,\" was anxiously expected by the impatient\ncrowd, and it was with distress amounting to agony that the master was\nobliged to announce, in person, the necessity of omitting that part of\nthe representation, on account of the illness of one of the young\nladies.\n\nScarcely had the words been uttered, and the speaker hidden his\nburning face behind the curtain, when Mr. Kingsbury started up in his\nplace amid the throng, to give a public recital of his grievance--no\nuncommon resort in the new country. He dashed at once to the point;\nand before some friends who saw the utter impropriety of his\nproceeding could persuade him to defer his vengeance, he had laid\nbefore the assembly--some three hundred people, perhaps--his own\nstatement of the case. He was got out at last, half coaxed, half\nhustled; and the gentle public only half understanding what had been\nset forth thus unexpectedly, made quite a pretty row of it. Some\nclamored loudly for the conclusion of the exercises; others gave\nutterances in no particularly choice terms to a variety of opinions as\nto the schoolmaster's proceedings, varying the note occasionally by\nshouting, \"The letters! the letters! why don't you bring out the\nletters?\"\n\nAt length, by means of much rapping on the desk by the president of\nthe evening, who was fortunately a \"popular\" character, order was\npartially restored; and the favorite scene from Miss More's dialogue\nof David and Goliath was announced as the closing piece. The sight of\nlittle David in a white tunic edged with red tape, with a calico scrip\nand a very primitive-looking sling; and a huge Goliath decorated with\na militia belt and sword, and a spear like a weaver's beam indeed,\nenchained everybody's attention. Even the peccant schoolmaster and his\npretended letters were forgotten, while the sapient Goliath, every\ntime that he raised the spear, in the energy of his declamation, to\nthump upon the stage, picked away fragments of the low ceiling, which\nfell conspicuously on his great shock of black hair. At last, with the\ncrowning threat, up went the spear for an astounding thump, and down\ncame a large piece of the ceiling, and with it--a shower of letters.\n\nThe confusion that ensued beggars all description. A general scramble\ntook place, and in another moment twenty pairs of eyes, at least, were\nfeasting on the choice phrases lavished upon Mr. Horner. Miss Bangle\nhad sat through the whole previous scene, trembling for herself,\nalthough she had, as she supposed, guarded cunningly against exposure.\nShe had needed no prophet to tell her what must be the result of a\ntete-a-tete between Mr. Horner and Ellen; and the moment she saw them\ndrive off together, she induced her imp to seize the opportunity of\nabstracting the whole parcel of letters from Mr. Horner's desk; which\nhe did by means of a sort of skill which comes by nature to such\ngoblins; picking the lock by the aid of a crooked nail, as neatly as\nif he had been born within the shadow of the Tombs.\n\nBut magicians sometimes suffer severely from the malice with which\nthey have themselves inspired their familiars. Joe Englehart having\nbeen a convenient tool thus far thought it quite time to torment Miss\nBangle a little; so, having stolen the letters at her bidding, he hid\nthem on his own account, and no persuasions of hers could induce him\nto reveal this important secret, which he chose to reserve as a rod in\ncase she refused him some intercession with his father, or some other\naccommodation, rendered necessary by his mischievous habits.\n\nHe had concealed the precious parcels in the unfloored loft above the\nschool-room, a place accessible only by means of a small trap-door\nwithout staircase or ladder; and here he meant to have kept them while\nit suited his purposes, but for the untimely intrusion of the weaver's\nbeam.\n\nMiss Bangle had sat through all, as we have said, thinking the letters\nsafe, yet vowing vengeance against her confederate for not allowing\nher to secure them by a satisfactory conflagration; and it was not\nuntil she heard her own name whispered through the crowd, that she was\nawakened to her true situation. The sagacity of the low creatures whom\nshe had despised showed them at once that the letters must be hers,\nsince her character had been pretty shrewdly guessed, and the\nhandwriting wore a more practised air than is usual among females in\nthe country. This was first taken for granted, and then spoken of as\nan acknowledged fact.\n\nThe assembly moved like the heavings of a troubled sea. Everybody felt\nthat this was everybody's business. \"Put her out!\" was heard from more\nthan one rough voice near the door, and this was responded to by loud\nand angry murmurs from within.\n\nMr. Englehart, not waiting to inquire into the merits of the case in\nthis scene of confusion, hastened to get his family out as quietly and\nas quickly as possible, but groans and hisses followed his niece as\nshe hung half-fainting on his arm, quailing completely beneath the\ninstinctive indignation of the rustic public. As she passed out, a\nyell resounded among the rude boys about the door, and she was lifted\ninto a sleigh, insensible from terror. She disappeared from that\nevening, and no one knew the time of her final departure for \"the\neast.\"\n\nMr. Kingsbury, who is a just man when he is not in a passion, made all\nthe reparation in his power for his harsh and ill-considered attack\nupon the master; and we believe that functionary did not show any\ntraits of implacability of character. At least he was seen, not many\ndays after, sitting peaceably at tea with Mr. Kingsbury, Aunt Sally,\nand Miss Ellen; and he has since gone home to build a house upon his\nfarm. And people _do_ say, that after a few months more, Ellen will\nnot need Miss Bangle's intervention if she should see fit to\ncorrespond with the schoolmaster.\n\n\n\nTHE WATKINSON EVENING\n\n[From _Godey's Lady's Book_, December, 1846.]\n\nBy Eliza Leslie (1787-1858)\n\nMrs. Morland, a polished and accomplished woman, was the widow of a\ndistinguished senator from one of the western states, of which, also,\nher husband had twice filled the office of governor. Her daughter\nhaving completed her education at the best boarding-school in\nPhiladelphia, and her son being about to graduate at Princeton, the\nmother had planned with her children a tour to Niagara and the lakes,\nreturning by way of Boston. On leaving Philadelphia, Mrs. Morland and\nthe delighted Caroline stopped at Princeton to be present at the\nannual commencement, and had the happiness of seeing their beloved\nEdward receive his diploma as bachelor of arts; after hearing him\ndeliver, with great applause, an oration on the beauties of the\nAmerican character. College youths are very prone to treat on subjects\nthat imply great experience of the world. But Edward Morland was full\nof kind feeling for everything and everybody; and his views of life\nhad hitherto been tinted with a perpetual rose-color.\n\nMrs. Morland, not depending altogether upon the celebrity of her late\nhusband, and wishing that her children should see specimens of the\nbest society in the northern cities, had left home with numerous\nletters of introduction. But when they arrived at New York, she found\nto her great regret, that having unpacked and taken out her small\ntraveling desk, during her short stay in Philadelphia, she had\nstrangely left it behind in the closet of her room at the hotel. In\nthis desk were deposited all her letters, except two which had been\noffered to her by friends in Philadelphia. The young people, impatient\nto see the wonders of Niagara, had entreated her to stay but a day or\ntwo in the city of New York, and thought these two letters would be\nquite sufficient for the present. In the meantime she wrote back to\nthe hotel, requesting that the missing desk should be forwarded to New\nYork as soon as possible.\n\nOn the morning after their arrival at the great commercial metropolis\nof America, the Morland family took a carriage to ride round through\nthe principal parts of the city, and to deliver their two letters at\nthe houses to which they were addressed, and which were both situated\nin the region that lies between the upper part of Broadway and the\nNorth River. In one of the most fashionable streets they found the\nelegant mansion of Mrs. St. Leonard; but on stopping at the door, were\ninformed that its mistress was not at home. They then left the\nintroductory letter (which they had prepared for this mischance, by\nenclosing it in an envelope with a card), and proceeding to another\nstreet considerably farther up, they arrived at the dwelling of the\nWatkinson family, to the mistress of which the other Philadelphia\nletter was directed. It was one of a large block of houses all exactly\nalike, and all shut up from top to bottom, according to a custom more\nprevalent in New York than in any other city.\n\nHere they were also unsuccessful; the servant who came to the door\ntelling them that the ladies were particularly engaged and could see\nno company. So they left their second letter and card and drove off,\ncontinuing their ride till they reached the Croton water works, which\nthey quitted the carriage to see and admire. On returning to the\nhotel, with the intention after an hour or two of rest to go out\nagain, and walk till near dinner-time, they found waiting them a note\nfrom Mrs. Watkinson, expressing her regret that she had not been able\nto see them when they called; and explaining that her family duties\nalways obliged her to deny herself the pleasure of receiving morning\nvisitors, and that her servants had general orders to that effect. But\nshe requested their company for that evening (naming nine o'clock as\nthe hour), and particularly desired an immediate answer.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Mrs. Morland, \"she intends asking some of her\nfriends to meet us, in case we accept the invitation; and therefore is\nnaturally desirous of a reply as soon as possible. Of course we will\nnot keep her in suspense. Mrs. Denham, who volunteered the letter,\nassured me that Mrs. Watkinson was one of the most estimable women in\nNew York, and a pattern to the circle in which she moved. It seems\nthat Mr. Denham and Mr. Watkinson are connected in business. Shall we\ngo?\"\n\nThe young people assented, saying they had no doubt of passing a\npleasant evening.\n\nThe billet of acceptance having been written, it was sent off\nimmediately, entrusted to one of the errand-goers belonging to the\nhotel, that it might be received in advance of the next hour for the\ndispatch-post--and Edward Morland desired the man to get into an\nomnibus with the note that no time might be lost in delivering it. \"It\nis but right\"--said he to his mother--\"that we should give Mrs.\nWatkinson an ample opportunity of making her preparations, and sending\nround to invite her friends.\"\n\n\"How considerate you are, dear Edward\"--said Caroline--\"always so\nthoughtful of every one's convenience. Your college friends must have\nidolized you.\"\n\n\"No\"--said Edward--\"they called me a prig.\" Just then a remarkably\nhandsome carriage drove up to the private door of the hotel. From it\nalighted a very elegant woman, who in a few moments was ushered into\nthe drawing-room by the head waiter, and on his designating Mrs.\nMorland's family, she advanced and gracefully announced herself as\nMrs. St. Leonard. This was the lady at whose house they had left the\nfirst letter of introduction. She expressed regret at not having been\nat home when they called; but said that on finding their letter, she\nhad immediately come down to see them, and to engage them for the\nevening. \"Tonight\"--said Mrs. St. Leonard--\"I expect as many friends\nas I can collect for a summer party. The occasion is the recent\nmarriage of my niece, who with her husband has just returned from\ntheir bridal excursion, and they will be soon on their way to their\nresidence in Baltimore. I think I can promise you an agreeable\nevening, as I expect some very delightful people, with whom I shall be\nmost happy to make you acquainted.\"\n\nEdward and Caroline exchanged glances, and could not refrain from\nlooking wistfully at their mother, on whose countenance a shade of\nregret was very apparent. After a short pause she replied to Mrs. St.\nLeonard--\"I am truly sorry to say that we have just answered in the\naffirmative a previous invitation for this very evening.\"\n\n\"I am indeed disappointed\"--said Mrs. St. Leonard, who had been\nlooking approvingly at the prepossessing appearance of the two young\npeople. \"Is there no way in which you can revoke your compliance with\nthis unfortunate first invitation--at least, I am sure, it is\nunfortunate for me. What a vexatious _contretemps_ that I should have\nchanced to be out when you called; thus missing the pleasure of seeing\nyou at once, and securing that of your society for this evening? The\ntruth is, I was disappointed in some of the preparations that had been\nsent home this morning, and I had to go myself and have the things\nrectified, and was detained away longer than I expected. May I ask to\nwhom you are engaged this evening? Perhaps I know the lady--if so, I\nshould be very much tempted to go and beg you from her.\"\n\n\"The lady is Mrs. John Watkinson\"--replied Mrs. Morland--\"most\nprobably she will invite some of her friends to meet us.\"\n\n\"That of course\"--answered Mrs. St. Leonard--\"I am really very\nsorry--and I regret to say that I do not know her at all.\"\n\n\"We shall have to abide by our first decision,\" said Mrs. Morland. \"By\nMrs. Watkinson, mentioning in her note the hour of nine, it is to be\npresumed she intends asking some other company. I cannot possibly\ndisappoint her. I can speak feelingly as to the annoyance (for I have\nknown it by my own experience) when after inviting a number of my\nfriends to meet some strangers, the strangers have sent an excuse\nalmost at the eleventh hour. I think no inducements, however strong,\ncould tempt me to do so myself.\"\n\n\"I confess that you are perfectly right,\" said Mrs. St. Leonard. \"I\nsee you must go to Mrs. Watkinson. But can you not divide the evening,\nby passing a part of it with her and then finishing with me?\"\n\nAt this suggestion the eyes of the young people sparkled, for they had\nbecome delighted with Mrs. St. Leonard, and imagined that a party at\nher house must be every way charming. Also, parties were novelties to\nboth of them.\n\n\"If possible we will do so,\" answered Mrs. Morland, \"and with what\npleasure I need not assure you. We leave New York to-morrow, but we\nshall return this way in September, and will then be exceedingly happy\nto see more of Mrs. St. Leonard.\"\n\nAfter a little more conversation Mrs. St. Leonard took her leave,\nrepeating her hope of still seeing her new friends at her house that\nnight; and enjoining them to let her know as soon as they returned to\nNew York on their way home.\n\nEdward Morland handed her to her carriage, and then joined his mother\nand sister in their commendations of Mrs. St. Leonard, with whose\nexceeding beauty were united a countenance beaming with intelligence,\nand a manner that put every one at their ease immediately.\n\n\"She is an evidence,\" said Edward, \"how superior our women of fashion\nare to those of Europe.\"\n\n\"Wait, my dear son,\" said Mrs. Morland, \"till you have been in Europe,\nand had an opportunity of forming an opinion on that point (as on many\nothers) from actual observation. For my part, I believe that in all\ncivilized countries the upper classes of people are very much alike,\nat least in their leading characteristics.\"\n\n\"Ah! here comes the man that was sent to Mrs. Watkinson,\" said\nCaroline Morland. \"I hope he could not find the house and has brought\nthe note back with him. We shall then be able to go at first to Mrs.\nSt. Leonard's, and pass the whole evening there.\"\n\nThe man reported that he _had_ found the house, and had delivered the\nnote into Mrs. Watkinson's own hands, as she chanced to be crossing\nthe entry when the door was opened; and that she read it immediately,\nand said \"Very well.\"\n\n\"Are you certain that you made no mistake in the house,\" said Edward,\n\"and that you really _did_ give it to Mrs. Watkinson?\"\n\n\"And it's quite sure I am, sir,\" replied the man, \"when I first came\nover from the ould country I lived with them awhile, and though when\nshe saw me to-day, she did not let on that she remembered my doing\nthat same, she could not help calling me James. Yes, the rale words\nshe said when I handed her the billy-dux was, 'Very well, James.'\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Edward, when they found themselves alone, \"let us\nlook on the bright side. If we do not find a large party at Mrs.\nWatkinson's, we may in all probability meet some very agreeable people\nthere, and enjoy the feast of reason and the flow of soul. We may find\nthe Watkinson house so pleasant as to leave it with regret even for\nMrs. St. Leonard's.\"\n\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Watkinson is in fashionable society,\" said\nCaroline, \"or Mrs. St. Leonard would have known her. I heard some of\nthe ladies here talking last evening of Mrs. St. Leonard, and I found\nfrom what they said that she is among the _elite_ of the _lite_.\"\n\n\"Even if she is,\" observed Mrs. Morland, \"are polish of manners and\ncultivation of mind confined exclusively to persons of that class?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Edward, \"the most talented and refined youth at\nour college, and he in whose society I found the greatest pleasure,\nwas the son of a bricklayer.\"\n\nIn the ladies' drawing-room, after dinner, the Morlands heard a\nconversation between several of the female guests, who all seemed to\nknow Mrs. St. Leonard very well by reputation, and they talked of her\nparty that was to \"come off\" on this evening.\n\n\"I hear,\" said one lady, \"that Mrs. St. Leonard is to have an unusual\nnumber of lions.\"\n\nShe then proceeded to name a gallant general, with his elegant wife\nand accomplished daughter; a celebrated commander in the navy; two\nhighly distinguished members of Congress, and even an ex-president.\nAlso several of the most eminent among the American literati, and two\nfirst-rate artists.\n\nEdward Morland felt as if he could say, \"Had I three ears I'd hear\nthee.\"\n\n\"Such a woman as Mrs. St. Leonard can always command the best lions\nthat are to be found,\" observed another lady.\n\n\"And then,\" said a third, \"I have been told that she has such\nexquisite taste in lighting and embellishing her always elegant rooms.\nAnd her supper table, whether for summer or winter parties, is so\nbeautifully arranged; all the viands are so delicious, and the\nattendance of the servants so perfect--and Mrs. St. Leonard does the\nhonors with so much ease and tact.\"\n\n\"Some friends of mine that visit her,\" said a fourth lady, \"describe\nher parties as absolute perfection. She always manages to bring\ntogether those persons that are best fitted to enjoy each other's\nconversation. Still no one is overlooked or neglected. Then everything\nat her reunions is so well proportioned--she has just enough of music,\nand just enough of whatever amusement may add to the pleasure of her\nguests; and still there is no appearance of design or management on\nher part.\"\n\n\"And better than all,\" said the lady who had spoken firsts \"Mrs. St.\nLeonard is one of the kindest, most generous, and most benevolent of\nwomen--she does good in every possible way.\"\n\n\"I can listen no longer,\" said Caroline to Edward, rising to change\nher seat. \"If I hear any more I shall absolutely hate the Watkinsons.\nHow provoking that they should have sent us the first invitation. If\nwe had only thought of waiting till we could hear from Mrs. St.\nLeonard!\"\n\n\"For shame, Caroline,\" said her brother, \"how can you talk so of\npersons you have never seen, and to whom you ought to feel grateful\nfor the kindness of their invitation; even if it has interfered with\nanother party, that I must confess seems to offer unusual attractions.\nNow I have a presentiment that we shall find the Watkinson part of the\nevening very enjoyable.\"\n\nAs soon as tea was over, Mrs. Morland and her daughter repaired to\ntheir toilettes. Fortunately, fashion as well as good taste, has\ndecided that, at a summer party, the costume of the ladies should\nnever go beyond an elegant simplicity. Therefore our two ladies in\npreparing for their intended appearance at Mrs. St. Leonard's, were\nenabled to attire themselves in a manner that would not seem out of\nplace in the smaller company they expected to meet at the Watkinsons.\nOver an under-dress of lawn, Caroline Morland put on a white organdy\ntrimmed with lace, and decorated with bows of pink ribbon. At the back\nof her head was a wreath of fresh and beautiful pink flowers, tied\nwith a similar ribbon. Mrs. Morland wore a black grenadine over a\nsatin, and a lace cap trimmed with white.\n\nIt was but a quarter past nine o'clock when their carriage stopped at\nthe Watkinson door. The front of the house looked very dark. Not a ray\ngleamed through the Venetian shutters, and the glimmer beyond the\nfan-light over the door was almost imperceptible. After the coachman\nhad rung several times, an Irish girl opened the door, cautiously (as\nIrish girls always do), and admitted them into the entry, where one\nlight only was burning in a branch lamp. \"Shall we go upstairs?\" said\nMrs. Morland. \"And what for would ye go upstairs?\" said the girl in a\npert tone. \"It's all dark there, and there's no preparations. Ye can\nlave your things here a-hanging on the rack. It is a party ye're\nexpecting? Blessed are them what expects nothing.\"\n\nThe sanguine Edward Morland looked rather blank at this intelligence,\nand his sister whispered to him, \"We'll get off to Mrs. St. Leonard's\nas soon as we possibly can. When did you tell the coachman to come for\nus?\"\n\n\"At half past ten,\" was the brother's reply.\n\n\"Oh! Edward, Edward!\" she exclaimed, \"And I dare say he will not be\npunctual. He may keep us here till eleven.\"\n\n\"_Courage, mes enfants_,\" said their mother, \"_et parlez plus\ndoucement_.\"\n\nThe girl then ushered them into the back parlor, saying, \"Here's the\ncompany.\"\n\nThe room was large and gloomy. A checquered mat covered the floor, and\nall the furniture was encased in striped calico covers, and the lamps,\nmirrors, etc. concealed under green gauze. The front parlor was\nentirely dark, and in the back apartment was no other light than a\nshaded lamp on a large centre table, round which was assembled a\ncircle of children of all sizes and ages. On a backless, cushionless\nsofa sat Mrs. Watkinson, and a young lady, whom she introduced as her\ndaughter Jane. And Mrs. Morland in return presented Edward and\nCaroline.\n\n\"Will you take the rocking-chair, ma'am?\" inquired Mrs. Watkinson.\n\nMrs. Morland declining the offer, the hostess took it herself, and\nsee-sawed on it nearly the whole time. It was a very awkward,\nhigh-legged, crouch-backed rocking-chair, and shamefully unprovided\nwith anything in the form of a footstool.\n\n\"My husband is away, at Boston, on business,\" said Mrs. Watkinson. \"I\nthought at first, ma'am, I should not be able to ask you here this\nevening, for it is not our way to have company in his absence; but my\ndaughter Jane over-persuaded me to send for you.\"\n\n\"What a pity,\" thought Caroline.\n\n\"You must take us as you find us, ma'am,\" continued Mrs. Watkinson.\n\"We use no ceremony with anybody; and our rule is never to put\nourselves out of the way. We do not give parties [looking at the\ndresses of the ladies]. Our first duty is to our children, and we\ncannot waste our substance on fashion and folly. They'll have cause to\nthank us for it when we die.\"\n\nSomething like a sob was heard from the centre table, at which the\nchildren were sitting, and a boy was seen to hold his handkerchief to\nhis face.\n\n\"Joseph, my child,\" said his mother, \"do not cry. You have no idea,\nma'am, what an extraordinary boy that is. You see how the bare mention\nof such a thing as our deaths has overcome him.\"\n\nThere was another sob behind the handkerchief, and the Morlands\nthought it now sounded very much like a smothered laugh.\n\n\"As I was saying, ma'am,\" continued Mrs. Watkinson, \"we never give\nparties. We leave all sinful things to the vain and foolish. My\ndaughter Jane has been telling me, that she heard this morning of a\nparty that is going on tonight at the widow St. Leonard's. It is only\nfifteen years since her husband died. He was carried off with a three\ndays' illness, but two months after they were married. I have had a\ndomestic that lived with them at the time, so I know all about it. And\nthere she is now, living in an elegant house, and riding in her\ncarriage, and dressing and dashing, and giving parties, and enjoying\nlife, as she calls it. Poor creature, how I pity her! Thank heaven,\nnobody that I know goes to her parties. If they did I would never wish\nto see them again in my house. It is an encouragement to folly and\nnonsense--and folly and nonsense are sinful. Do not you think so,\nma'am?\"\n\n\"If carried too far they may certainly become so,\" replied Mrs.\nMorland.\n\n\"We have heard,\" said Edward, \"that Mrs. St. Leonard, though one of\nthe ornaments of the gay world, has a kind heart, a beneficent spirit\nand a liberal hand.\"\n\n\"I know very little about her,\" replied Mrs. Watkinson, drawing up her\nhead, \"and I have not the least desire to know any more. It is well\nshe has no children; they'd be lost sheep if brought up in her fold.\nFor my part, ma'am,\" she continued, turning to Mrs. Morland, \"I am\nquite satisfied with the quiet joys of a happy home. And no mother has\nthe least business with any other pleasures. My innocent babes know\nnothing about plays, and balls, and parties; and they never shall. Do\nthey look as if they had been accustomed to a life of pleasure?\"\n\nThey certainly did not! for when the Morlands took a glance at them,\nthey thought they had never seen youthful faces that were less gay,\nand indeed less prepossessing.\n\nThere was not a good feature or a pleasant expression among them all.\nEdward Morland recollected his having often read \"that childhood is\nalways lovely.\" But he saw that the juvenile Watkinsons were an\nexception to the rule.\n\n\"The first duty of a mother is to her children,\" repeated Mrs.\nWatkinson. \"Till nine o'clock, my daughter Jane and myself are\noccupied every evening in hearing the lessons that they have learned\nfor to-morrow's school. Before that hour we can receive no visitors,\nand we never have company to tea, as that would interfere too much\nwith our duties. We had just finished hearing these lessons when you\narrived. Afterwards the children are permitted to indulge themselves\nin rational play, for I permit no amusement that is not also\ninstructive. My children are so well trained, that even when alone\ntheir sports are always serious.\"\n\nTwo of the boys glanced slyly at each other, with what Edward Morland\ncomprehended as an expression of pitch-penny and marbles.\n\n\"They are now engaged at their game of astronomy,\" continued Mrs.\nWatkinson. \"They have also a sort of geography cards, and a set of\nmathematical cards. It is a blessed discovery, the invention of these\neducationary games; so that even the play-time of children can be\nturned to account. And you have no idea, ma'am, how they enjoy them.\"\n\nJust then the boy Joseph rose from the table, and stalking up to Mrs.\nWatkinson, said to her, \"Mamma, please to whip me.\"\n\nAt this unusual request the visitors looked much amazed, and Mrs.\nWatkinson replied to him, \"Whip you, my best Joseph--for what cause? I\nhave not seen you do anything wrong this evening, and you know my\nanxiety induces me to watch my children all the time.\"\n\n\"You could not see me,\" answered Joseph, \"for I have not _done_\nanything very wrong. But I have had a bad thought, and you know Mr.\nIronrule says that a fault imagined is just as wicked as a fault\ncommitted.\"\n\n\"You see, ma'am, what a good memory he has,\" said Mrs. Watkinson aside\nto Mrs. Morland. \"But my best Joseph, you make your mother tremble.\nWhat fault have you imagined? What was your bad thought?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said another boy, \"what's your thought like?\"\n\n\"My thought,\" said Joseph, \"was 'Confound all astronomy, and I could\nsee the man hanged that made this game.'\"\n\n\"Oh! my child,\" exclaimed the mother, stopping her ears, \"I am indeed\nshocked. I am glad you repented so immediately.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Joseph, \"but I am afraid my repentance won't last. If\nI am not whipped, I may have these bad thoughts whenever I play at\nastronomy, and worse still at the geography game. Whip me, ma, and\npunish me as I deserve. There's the rattan in the corner: I'll bring\nit to you myself.\"\n\n\"Excellent boy!\" said his mother. \"You know I always pardon my\nchildren when they are so candid as to confess their faults.\"\n\n\"So you do,\" said Joseph, \"but a whipping will cure me better.\"\n\n\"I cannot resolve to punish so conscientious a child,\" said Mrs.\nWatkinson.\n\n\"Shall I take the trouble off your hands?\" inquired Edward, losing all\npatience in his disgust at the sanctimonious hypocrisy of this young\nBlifil. \"It is such a rarity for a boy to request a whipping, that so\nremarkable a desire ought by all means to be gratified.\"\n\nJoseph turned round and made a face at him.\n\n\"Give me the rattan,\" said Edward, half laughing, and offering to take\nit out of his hand. \"I'll use it to your full satisfaction.\"\n\nThe boy thought it most prudent to stride off and return to the table,\nand ensconce himself among his brothers and sisters; some of whom were\nstaring with stupid surprise; others were whispering and giggling in\nthe hope of seeing Joseph get a real flogging.\n\nMrs. Watkinson having bestowed a bitter look on Edward, hastened to\nturn the attention of his mother to something else. \"Mrs. Morland,\"\nsaid she, \"allow me to introduce you to my youngest hope.\" She pointed\nto a sleepy boy about five years old, who with head thrown back and\nmouth wide open, was slumbering in his chair.\n\nMrs. Watkinson's children were of that uncomfortable species who never\ngo to bed; at least never without all manner of resistance. All her\nboasted authority was inadequate to compel them; they never would\nconfess themselves sleepy; always wanted to \"sit up,\" and there was a\nnightly scene of scolding, coaxing, threatening and manoeuvring to get\nthem off.\n\n\"I declare,\" said Mrs. Watkinson, \"dear Benny is almost asleep. Shake\nhim up, Christopher. I want him to speak a speech. His school-mistress\ntakes great pains in teaching her little pupils to speak, and stands\nup herself and shows them how.\"\n\nThe child having been shaken up hard (two or three others helping\nChristopher), rubbed his eyes and began to whine. His mother went to\nhim, took him on her lap, hushed him up, and began to coax him. This\ndone, she stood him on his feet before Mrs. Morland, and desired him\nto speak a speech for the company. The child put his thumb into his\nmouth, and remained silent.\n\n\"Ma,\" said Jane Watkinson, \"you had better tell him what speech to\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Speak Cato or Plato,\" said his mother. \"Which do you call it? Come\nnow, Benny--how does it begin? 'You are quite right and reasonable,\nPlato.' That's it.\"\n\n\"Speak Lucius,\" said his sister Jane. \"Come now, Benny--say 'your\nthoughts are turned on peace.'\"\n\nThe little boy looked very much as if they were _not_, and as if\nmeditating an outbreak.\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Christopher, \"let him say Hamlet. Come now,\nBenny--'To be or not to be.'\"\n\n\"It ain't to be at all,\" cried Benny, \"and I won't speak the least bit\nof it for any of you. I hate that speech!\"\n\n\"Only see his obstinacy,\" said the solemn Joseph. \"And is he to be\ngiven up to?\"\n\n\"Speak anything, Benny,\" said Mrs. Watkinson, \"anything so that it is\nonly a speech.\"\n\nAll the Watkinson voices now began to clamor violently at the\nobstinate child--\"Speak a speech! speak a speech! speak a speech!\" But\nthey had no more effect than the reiterated exhortations with which\nnurses confuse the poor heads of babies, when they require them to\n\"shake a day-day--shake a day-day!\"\n\nMrs. Morland now interfered, and begged that the sleepy little boy\nmight be excused; on which he screamed out that \"he wasn't sleepy at\nall, and would not go to bed ever.\"\n\n\"I never knew any of my children behave so before,\" said Mrs.\nWatkinson. \"They are always models of obedience, ma'am. A look is\nsufficient for them. And I must say that they have in every way\nprofited by the education we are giving them. It is not our way,\nma'am, to waste our money in parties and fooleries, and fine furniture\nand fine clothes, and rich food, and all such abominations. Our first\nduty is to our children, and to make them learn everything that is\ntaught in the schools. If they go wrong, it will not be for want of\neducation. Hester, my dear, come and talk to Miss Morland in French.\"\n\nHester (unlike her little brother that would not speak a speech)\nstepped boldly forward, and addressed Caroline Morland with:\n\"_Parlez-vous Francais, mademoiselle? Comment se va madame votre mere?\nAimez-vous la musique? Aimez-vous la danse? Bon jour--bon soir--bon\nrepos. Comprenez-vous?_\"\n\nTo this tirade, uttered with great volubility, Miss Morland made no\nother reply than, \"_Oui--je comprens._\"\n\n\"Very well, Hester--very well indeed,\" said Mrs. Watkinson. \"You see,\nma'am,\" turning to Mrs. Morland, \"how very fluent she is in French;\nand she has only been learning eleven quarters.\"\n\nAfter considerable whispering between Jane and her mother, the former\nwithdrew, and sent in by the Irish girl a waiter with a basket of soda\nbiscuit, a pitcher of water, and some glasses. Mrs. Watkinson invited\nher guests to consider themselves at home and help themselves freely,\nsaying: \"We never let cakes, sweetmeats, confectionery, or any such\nthings enter the house, as they would be very unwholesome for the\nchildren, and it would be sinful to put temptation in their way. I am\nsure, ma'am, you will agree with me that the plainest food is the best\nfor everybody. People that want nice things may go to parties for\nthem; but they will never get any with me.\"\n\nWhen the collation was over, and every child provided with a biscuit,\nMrs. Watkinson said to Mrs. Morland: \"Now, ma'am, you shall have some\nmusic from my daughter Jane, who is one of Mr. Bangwhanger's best\nscholars.\"\n\nJane Watkinson sat down to the piano and commenced a powerful piece of\nsix mortal pages, which she played out of time and out of tune; but\nwith tremendous force of hands; notwithstanding which, it had,\nhowever, the good effect of putting most of the children to sleep.\n\nTo the Morlands the evening had seemed already five hours long. Still\nit was only half past ten when Jane was in the midst of her piece. The\nguests had all tacitly determined that it would be best not to let\nMrs. Watkinson know their intention to go directly from her house to\nMrs. St. Leonard's party; and the arrival of their carriage would have\nbeen the signal of departure, even if Jane's piece had not reached its\ntermination. They stole glances at the clock on the mantel. It wanted\nbut a quarter of eleven, when Jane rose from the piano, and was\ncongratulated by her mother on the excellence of her music. Still no\ncarriage was heard to stop; no doorbell was heard to ring. Mrs.\nMorland expressed her fears that the coachman had forgotten to come\nfor them.\n\n\"Has he been paid for bringing you here?\" asked Mrs. Watkinson.\n\n\"I paid him when we came to the door,\" said Edward. \"I thought perhaps\nhe might want the money for some purpose before he came for us.\"\n\n\"That was very kind in you, sir,\" said Mrs. Watkinson, \"but not very\nwise. There's no dependence on any coachman; and perhaps as he may be\nsure of business enough this rainy night he may never come at\nall--being already paid for bringing you here.\"\n\nNow, the truth was that the coachman _had_ come at the appointed time,\nbut the noise of Jane's piano had prevented his arrival being heard in\nthe back parlor. The Irish girl had gone to the door when he rang the\nbell, and recognized in him what she called \"an ould friend.\" Just\nthen a lady and gentleman who had been caught in the rain came running\nalong, and seeing a carriage drawing up at a door, the gentleman\ninquired of the driver if he could not take them to Rutgers Place. The\ndriver replied that he had just come for two ladies and a gentleman\nwhom he had brought from the Astor House.\n\n\"Indeed and Patrick,\" said the girl who stood at the door, \"if I was\nyou I'd be after making another penny to-night. Miss Jane is pounding\naway at one of her long music pieces, and it won't be over before you\nhave time to get to Rutgers and back again. And if you do make them\nwait awhile, where's the harm? They've a dry roof over their heads,\nand I warrant it's not the first waiting they've ever had in their\nlives; and it won't be the last neither.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the gentleman; and regardless of the propriety of\nfirst sending to consult the persons who had engaged the carriage, he\ntold his wife to step in, and following her instantly himself, they\ndrove away to Rutgers Place.\n\nReader, if you were ever detained in a strange house by the\nnon-arrival of your carriage, you will easily understand the excessive\nannoyance of finding that you are keeping a family out of their beds\nbeyond their usual hour. And in this case, there was a double\ngrievance; the guests being all impatience to get off to a better\nplace. The children, all crying when wakened from their sleep, were\nfinally taken to bed by two servant maids, and Jane Watkinson, who\nnever came back again. None were left but Hester, the great French\nscholar, who, being one of those young imps that seem to have the\nfaculty of living without sleep, sat bolt upright with her eyes wide\nopen, watching the uncomfortable visitors.\n\nThe Morlands felt as if they could bear it no longer, and Edward\nproposed sending for another carriage to the nearest livery stable.\n\n\"We don't keep a man now,\" said Mrs. Watkinson, who sat nodding in the\nrocking-chair, attempting now and then a snatch of conversation, and\nsaying \"ma'am\" still more frequently than usual. \"Men servants are\ndreadful trials, ma'am, and we gave them up three years ago. And I\ndon't know how Mary or Katy are to go out this stormy night in search\nof a livery stable.\"\n\n\"On no consideration could I allow the women to do so,\" replied\nEdward. \"If you will oblige me by the loan of an umbrella, I will go\nmyself.\"\n\nAccordingly he set out on this business, but was unsuccessful at two\nlivery stables, the carriages being all out. At last he found one, and\nwas driven in it to Mr. Watkinson's house, where his mother and sister\nwere awaiting him, all quite ready, with their calashes and shawls on.\nThey gladly took their leave; Mrs. Watkinson rousing herself to hope\nthey had spent a pleasant evening, and that they would come and pass\nanother with her on their return to New York. In such cases how\ndifficult it is to reply even with what are called \"words of course.\"\n\nA kitchen lamp was brought to light them to the door, the entry lamp\nhaving long since been extinguished. Fortunately the rain had ceased;\nthe stars began to reappear, and the Morlands, when they found\nthemselves in the carriage and on their way to Mrs. St. Leonard's,\nfelt as if they could breathe again. As may be supposed, they freely\ndiscussed the annoyances of the evening; but now those troubles were\nover they felt rather inclined to be merry about them.\n\n\"Dear mother,\" said Edward, \"how I pitied you for having to endure\nMrs. Watkinson's perpetual 'ma'aming' and 'ma'aming'; for I know you\ndislike the word.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Caroline, \"I was not so prone to be taken with\nridiculous recollections. But really to-night I could not get that old\nfoolish child's play out of my head--\n\n  Here come three knights out of Spain\n  A-courting of your daughter Jane.\"\n\n\"_I_ shall certainly never be one of those Spanish knights,\" said\nEdward. \"Her daughter Jane is in no danger of being ruled by any\n'flattering tongue' of mine. But what a shame for us to be talking of\nthem in this manner.\"\n\nThey drove to Mrs. St. Leonard's, hoping to be yet in time to pass\nhalf an hour there; though it was now near twelve o'clock and summer\nparties never continue to a very late hour. But as they came into the\nstreet in which she lived they were met by a number of coaches on\ntheir way home, and on reaching the door of her brilliantly lighted\nmansion, they saw the last of the guests driving off in the last of\nthe carriages, and several musicians coming down the steps with their\ninstruments in their hands.\n\n\"So there _has_ been a dance, then!\" sighed Caroline. \"Oh, what we\nhave missed! It is really too provoking.\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Edward; \"but remember that to-morrow morning we set\noff for Niagara.\"\n\n\"I will leave a note for Mrs. St. Leonard,\" said his mother,\n\"explaining that we were detained at Mrs. Watkinson's by our coachman\ndisappointing us. Let us console ourselves with the hope of seeing\nmore of this lady on our return. And now, dear Caroline, you must draw\na moral from the untoward events of to-day. When you are mistress of a\nhouse, and wish to show civility to strangers, let the invitation be\nalways accompanied with a frank disclosure of what they are to expect.\nAnd if you cannot conveniently invite company to meet them, tell them\nat once that you will not insist on their keeping their engagement\nwith _you_ if anything offers afterwards that they think they would\nprefer; provided only that they apprize you in time of the change in\ntheir plan.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma,\" replied Caroline, \"you may be sure I shall always take\ncare not to betray my visitors into an engagement which they may have\ncause to regret, particularly if they are strangers whose time is\nlimited. I shall certainly, as you say, tell them not to consider\nthemselves bound to me if they afterwards receive an invitation which\npromises them more enjoyment. It will be a long while before I forget,\nthe Watkinson evening.\"\n\n\n\nTITBOTTOM'S SPECTACLES\n\nBY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS (1824-1892)\n\n[From _Putnam's Monthly_, December, 1854. Republished in the volume,\n_Prue and I_ (1856), by George William Curtis (Harper & Brothers).]\n\nIn my mind's eye, Horatio.\n\nPrue and I do not entertain much; our means forbid it. In truth, other\npeople entertain for us. We enjoy that hospitality of which no account\nis made. We see the show, and hear the music, and smell the flowers of\ngreat festivities, tasting as it were the drippings from rich dishes.\nOur own dinner service is remarkably plain, our dinners, even on state\noccasions, are strictly in keeping, and almost our only guest is\nTitbottom. I buy a handful of roses as I come up from the office,\nperhaps, and Prue arranges them so prettily in a glass dish for the\ncentre of the table that even when I have hurried out to see Aurelia\nstep into her carriage to go out to dine, I have thought that the\nbouquet she carried was not more beautiful because it was more costly.\nI grant that it was more harmonious with her superb beauty and her\nrich attire. And I have no doubt that if Aurelia knew the old man,\nwhom she must have seen so often watching her, and his wife, who\nornaments her sex with as much sweetness, although with less splendor,\nthan Aurelia herself, she would also acknowledge that the nosegay of\nroses was as fine and fit upon their table as her own sumptuous\nbouquet is for herself. I have that faith in the perception of that\nlovely lady. It is at least my habit--I hope I may say, my nature, to\nbelieve the best of people, rather than the worst. If I thought that\nall this sparkling setting of beauty--this fine fashion--these blazing\njewels and lustrous silks and airy gauzes, embellished with\ngold-threaded embroidery and wrought in a thousand exquisite\nelaborations, so that I cannot see one of those lovely girls pass me\nby without thanking God for the vision--if I thought that this was\nall, and that underneath her lace flounces and diamond bracelets\nAurelia was a sullen, selfish woman, then I should turn sadly\nhomewards, for I should see that her jewels were flashing scorn upon\nthe object they adorned, and that her laces were of a more exquisite\nloveliness than the woman whom they merely touched with a superficial\ngrace. It would be like a gaily decorated mausoleum--bright to see,\nbut silent and dark within.\n\n\"Great excellences, my dear Prue,\" I sometimes allow myself to say,\n\"lie concealed in the depths of character, like pearls at the bottom\nof the sea. Under the laughing, glancing surface, how little they are\nsuspected! Perhaps love is nothing else than the sight of them by one\nperson. Hence every man's mistress is apt to be an enigma to everybody\nelse. I have no doubt that when Aurelia is engaged, people will say\nthat she is a most admirable girl, certainly; but they cannot\nunderstand why any man should be in love with her. As if it were at\nall necessary that they should! And her lover, like a boy who finds a\npearl in the public street, and wonders as much that others did not\nsee it as that he did, will tremble until he knows his passion is\nreturned; feeling, of course, that the whole world must be in love\nwith this paragon who cannot possibly smile upon anything so unworthy\nas he.\"\n\n\"I hope, therefore, my dear Mrs. Prue,\" I continue to say to my wife,\nwho looks up from her work regarding me with pleased pride, as if I\nwere such an irresistible humorist, \"you will allow me to believe that\nthe depth may be calm although the surface is dancing. If you tell me\nthat Aurelia is but a giddy girl, I shall believe that you think so.\nBut I shall know, all the while, what profound dignity, and sweetness,\nand peace lie at the foundation of her character.\"\n\nI say such things to Titbottom during the dull season at the office.\nAnd I have known him sometimes to reply with a kind of dry, sad humor,\nnot as if he enjoyed the joke, but as if the joke must be made, that\nhe saw no reason why I should be dull because the season was so.\n\n\"And what do I know of Aurelia or any other girl?\" he says to me with\nthat abstracted air. \"I, whose Aurelias were of another century and\nanother zone.\"\n\nThen he falls into a silence which it seems quite profane to\ninterrupt. But as we sit upon our high stools at the desk opposite\neach other, I leaning upon my elbows and looking at him; he, with\nsidelong face, glancing out of the window, as if it commanded a\nboundless landscape, instead of a dim, dingy office court, I cannot\nrefrain from saying:\n\n\"Well!\"\n\nHe turns slowly, and I go chatting on--a little too loquacious,\nperhaps, about those young girls. But I know that Titbottom regards\nsuch an excess as venial, for his sadness is so sweet that you could\nbelieve it the reflection of a smile from long, long years ago.\n\nOne day, after I had been talking for a long time, and we had put up\nour books, and were preparing to leave, he stood for some time by the\nwindow, gazing with a drooping intentness, as if he really saw\nsomething more than the dark court, and said slowly:\n\n\"Perhaps you would have different impressions of things if you saw\nthem through my spectacles.\"\n\nThere was no change in his expression. He still looked from the\nwindow, and I said:\n\n\"Titbottom, I did not know that you used glasses. I have never seen\nyou wearing spectacles.\"\n\n\"No, I don't often wear them. I am not very fond of looking through\nthem. But sometimes an irresistible necessity compels me to put them\non, and I cannot help seeing.\" Titbottom sighed.\n\n\"Is it so grievous a fate, to see?\" inquired I.\n\n\"Yes; through my spectacles,\" he said, turning slowly and looking at\nme with wan solemnity.\n\nIt grew dark as we stood in the office talking, and taking our hats we\nwent out together. The narrow street of business was deserted. The\nheavy iron shutters were gloomily closed over the windows. From one or\ntwo offices struggled the dim gleam of an early candle, by whose light\nsome perplexed accountant sat belated, and hunting for his error. A\ncareless clerk passed, whistling. But the great tide of life had\nebbed. We heard its roar far away, and the sound stole into that\nsilent street like the murmur of the ocean into an inland dell.\n\n\"You will come and dine with us, Titbottom?\"\n\nHe assented by continuing to walk with me, and I think we were both\nglad when we reached the house, and Prue came to meet us, saying:\n\n\"Do you know I hoped you would bring Mr. Titbottom to dine?\"\n\nTitbottom smiled gently, and answered:\n\n\"He might have brought his spectacles with him, and I have been a\nhappier man for it.\"\n\nPrue looked a little puzzled.\n\n\"My dear,\" I said, \"you must know that our friend, Mr. Titbottom, is\nthe happy possessor of a pair of wonderful spectacles. I have never\nseen them, indeed; and, from what he says, I should be rather afraid\nof being seen by them. Most short-sighted persons are very glad to\nhave the help of glasses; but Mr. Titbottom seems to find very little\npleasure in his.\"\n\n\"It is because they make him too far-sighted, perhaps,\" interrupted\nPrue quietly, as she took the silver soup-ladle from the sideboard.\n\nWe sipped our wine after dinner, and Prue took her work. Can a man be\ntoo far-sighted? I did not ask the question aloud. The very tone in\nwhich Prue had spoken convinced me that he might.\n\n\"At least,\" I said, \"Mr. Titbottom will not refuse to tell us the\nhistory of his mysterious spectacles. I have known plenty of magic in\neyes\"--and I glanced at the tender blue eyes of Prue--\"but I have not\nheard of any enchanted glasses.\"\n\n\"Yet you must have seen the glass in which your wife looks every\nmorning, and I take it that glass must be daily enchanted.\" said\nTitbottom, with a bow of quaint respect to my wife.\n\nI do not think I have seen such a blush upon Prue's cheek since--well,\nsince a great many years ago.\n\n\"I will gladly tell you the history of my spectacles,\" began\nTitbottom. \"It is very simple; and I am not at all sure that a great\nmany other people have not a pair of the same kind. I have never,\nindeed, heard of them by the gross, like those of our young friend,\nMoses, the son of the Vicar of Wakefield. In fact, I think a gross\nwould be quite enough to supply the world. It is a kind of article for\nwhich the demand does not increase with use. If we should all wear\nspectacles like mine, we should never smile any more. Oh--I am not\nquite sure--we should all be very happy.\"\n\n\"A very important difference,\" said Prue, counting her stitches.\n\n\"You know my grandfather Titbottom was a West Indian. A large\nproprietor, and an easy man, he basked in the tropical sun, leading\nhis quiet, luxurious life. He lived much alone, and was what people\ncall eccentric, by which I understand that he was very much himself,\nand, refusing the influence of other people, they had their little\nrevenges, and called him names. It is a habit not exclusively\ntropical. I think I have seen the same thing even in this city. But he\nwas greatly beloved--my bland and bountiful grandfather. He was so\nlarge-hearted and open-handed. He was so friendly, and thoughtful, and\ngenial, that even his jokes had the air of graceful benedictions. He\ndid not seem to grow old, and he was one of those who never appear to\nhave been very young. He flourished in a perennial maturity, an\nimmortal middle-age.\n\n\"My grandfather lived upon one of the small islands, St. Kit's,\nperhaps, and his domain extended to the sea. His house, a rambling\nWest Indian mansion, was surrounded with deep, spacious piazzas,\ncovered with luxurious lounges, among which one capacious chair was\nhis peculiar seat. They tell me he used sometimes to sit there for the\nwhole day, his great, soft, brown eyes fastened upon the sea, watching\nthe specks of sails that flashed upon the horizon, while the\nevanescent expressions chased each other over his placid face, as if\nit reflected the calm and changing sea before him. His morning costume\nwas an ample dressing-gown of gorgeously flowered silk, and his\nmorning was very apt to last all day.\n\n\"He rarely read, but he would pace the great piazza for hours, with\nhis hands sunken in the pockets of his dressing-gown, and an air of\nsweet reverie, which any author might be very happy to produce.\n\n\"Society, of course, he saw little. There was some slight apprehension\nthat if he were bidden to social entertainments he might forget his\ncoat, or arrive without some other essential part of his dress; and\nthere is a sly tradition in the Titbottom family that, having been\ninvited to a ball in honor of the new governor of the island, my\ngrandfather Titbottom sauntered into the hall towards midnight,\nwrapped in the gorgeous flowers of his dressing-gown, and with his\nhands buried in the pockets, as usual. There was great excitement, and\nimmense deprecation of gubernatorial ire. But it happened that the\ngovernor and my grandfather were old friends, and there was no\noffense. But as they were conversing together, one of the distressed\nmanagers cast indignant glances at the brilliant costume of my\ngrandfather, who summoned him, and asked courteously:\n\n\"'Did you invite me or my coat?'\n\n\"'You, in a proper coat,' replied the manager.\n\n\"The governor smiled approvingly, and looked at my grandfather.\n\n\"'My friend,\" said he to the manager, 'I beg your pardon, I forgot.'\n\n\"The next day my grandfather was seen promenading in full ball dress\nalong the streets of the little town.\n\n\"'They ought to know,' said he, 'that I have a proper coat, and that\nnot contempt nor poverty, but forgetfulness, sent me to a ball in my\ndressing-gown.'\n\n\"He did not much frequent social festivals after this failure, but he\nalways told the story with satisfaction and a quiet smile.\n\n\"To a stranger, life upon those little islands is uniform even to\nweariness. But the old native dons like my grandfather ripen in the\nprolonged sunshine, like the turtle upon the Bahama banks, nor know of\nexistence more desirable. Life in the tropics I take to be a placid\ntorpidity. During the long, warm mornings of nearly half a century, my\ngrandfather Titbottom had sat in his dressing-gown and gazed at the\nsea. But one calm June day, as he slowly paced the piazza after\nbreakfast, his dreamy glance was arrested by a little vessel,\nevidently nearing the shore. He called for his spyglass, and surveying\nthe craft, saw that she came from the neighboring island. She glided\nsmoothly, slowly, over the summer sea. The warm morning air was sweet\nwith perfumes, and silent with heat. The sea sparkled languidly, and\nthe brilliant blue hung cloudlessly over. Scores of little island\nvessels had my grandfather seen come over the horizon, and cast anchor\nin the port. Hundreds of summer mornings had the white sails flashed\nand faded, like vague faces through forgotten dreams. But this time he\nlaid down the spyglass, and leaned against a column of the piazza, and\nwatched the vessel with an intentness that he could not explain. She\ncame nearer and nearer, a graceful spectre in the dazzling morning.\n\n\"'Decidedly I must step down and see about that vessel,' said my\ngrandfather Titbottom.\n\n\"He gathered his ample dressing-gown about him, and stepped from the\npiazza with no other protection from the sun than the little smoking\ncap upon his head. His face wore a calm, beaming smile, as if he\napproved of all the world. He was not an old man, but there was almost\na patriarchal pathos in his expression as he sauntered along in the\nsunshine towards the shore. A group of idle gazers was collected to\nwatch the arrival. The little vessel furled her sails and drifted\nslowly landward, and as she was of very light draft, she came close to\nthe shelving shore. A long plank was put out from her side, and the\ndebarkation commenced. My grandfather Titbottom stood looking on to\nsee the passengers descend. There were but a few of them, and mostly\ntraders from the neighboring island. But suddenly the face of a young\ngirl appeared over the side of the vessel, and she stepped upon the\nplank to descend. My grandfather Titbottom instantly advanced, and\nmoving briskly reached the top of the plank at the same moment, and\nwith the old tassel of his cap flashing in the sun, and one hand in\nthe pocket of his dressing gown, with the other he handed the young\nlady carefully down the plank. That young lady was afterwards my\ngrandmother Titbottom.\n\n\"And so, over the gleaming sea which he had watched so long, and which\nseemed thus to reward his patient gaze, came his bride that sunny\nmorning.\n\n\"'Of course we are happy,' he used to say: 'For you are the gift of\nthe sun I have loved so long and so well.' And my grandfather\nTitbottom would lay his hand so tenderly upon the golden hair of his\nyoung bride, that you could fancy him a devout Parsee caressing\nsunbeams.\n\n\"There were endless festivities upon occasion of the marriage; and my\ngrandfather did not go to one of them in his dressing-gown. The gentle\nsweetness of his wife melted every heart into love and sympathy. He\nwas much older than she, without doubt. But age, as he used to say\nwith a smile of immortal youth, is a matter of feeling, not of years.\nAnd if, sometimes, as she sat by his side upon the piazza, her fancy\nlooked through her eyes upon that summer sea and saw a younger lover,\nperhaps some one of those graceful and glowing heroes who occupy the\nforeground of all young maidens' visions by the sea, yet she could not\nfind one more generous and gracious, nor fancy one more worthy and\nloving than my grandfather Titbottom. And if in the moonlit midnight,\nwhile he lay calmly sleeping, she leaned out of the window and sank\ninto vague reveries of sweet possibility, and watched the gleaming\npath of the moonlight upon the water, until the dawn glided over\nit--it was only that mood of nameless regret and longing, which\nunderlies all human happiness,--or it was the vision of that life of\nsociety, which she had never seen, but of which she had often read,\nand which looked very fair and alluring across the sea to a girlish\nimagination which knew that it should never know that reality.\n\n\"These West Indian years were the great days of the family,\" said\nTitbottom, with an air of majestic and regal regret, pausing and\nmusing in our little parlor, like a late Stuart in exile, remembering\nEngland. Prue raised her eyes from her work, and looked at him with a\nsubdued admiration; for I have observed that, like the rest of her\nsex, she has a singular sympathy with the representative of a reduced\nfamily. Perhaps it is their finer perception which leads these\ntender-hearted women to recognize the divine right of social\nsuperiority so much more readily than we; and yet, much as Titbottom\nwas enhanced in my wife's admiration by the discovery that his dusky\nsadness of nature and expression was, as it were, the expiring gleam\nand late twilight of ancestral splendors, I doubt if Mr. Bourne would\nhave preferred him for bookkeeper a moment sooner upon that account.\nIn truth, I have observed, down town, that the fact of your ancestors\ndoing nothing is not considered good proof that you can do anything.\nBut Prue and her sex regard sentiment more than action, and I\nunderstand easily enough why she is never tired of hearing me read of\nPrince Charlie. If Titbottom had been only a little younger, a little\nhandsomer, a little more gallantly dressed--in fact, a little more of\nthe Prince Charlie, I am sure her eyes would not have fallen again\nupon her work so tranquilly, as he resumed his story.\n\n\"I can remember my grandfather Titbottom, although I was a very young\nchild, and he was a very old man. My young mother and my young\ngrandmother are very distinct figures in my memory, ministering to the\nold gentleman, wrapped in his dressing-gown, and seated upon the\npiazza. I remember his white hair and his calm smile, and how, not\nlong before he died, he called me to him, and laying his hand upon my\nhead, said to me:\n\n\"My child, the world is not this great sunny piazza, nor life the\nfairy stories which the women tell you here as you sit in their laps.\nI shall soon be gone, but I want to leave with you some memento of my\nlove for you, and I know nothing more valuable than these spectacles,\nwhich your grandmother brought from her native island, when she\narrived here one fine summer morning, long ago. I cannot quite tell\nwhether, when you grow older, you will regard it as a gift of the\ngreatest value or as something that you had been happier never to have\npossessed.'\n\n\"'But grandpapa, I am not short-sighted.'\n\n\"'My son, are you not human?' said the old gentleman; and how shall I\never forget the thoughtful sadness with which, at the same time he\nhanded me the spectacles.\n\n\"Instinctively I put them on, and looked at my grandfather. But I saw\nno grandfather, no piazza, no flowered dressing-gown: I saw only a\nluxuriant palm-tree, waving broadly over a tranquil landscape.\nPleasant homes clustered around it. Gardens teeming with fruit and\nflowers; flocks quietly feeding; birds wheeling and chirping. I heard\nchildren's voices, and the low lullaby of happy mothers. The sound of\ncheerful singing came wafted from distant fields upon the light\nbreeze. Golden harvests glistened out of sight, and I caught their\nrustling whisper of prosperity. A warm, mellow atmosphere bathed the\nwhole. I have seen copies of the landscapes of the Italian painter\nClaude which seemed to me faint reminiscences of that calm and happy\nvision. But all this peace and prosperity seemed to flow from the\nspreading palm as from a fountain.\n\n\"I do not know how long I looked, but I had, apparently, no power, as\nI had no will, to remove the spectacles. What a wonderful island must\nNevis be, thought I, if people carry such pictures in their pockets,\nonly by buying a pair of spectacles! What wonder that my dear\ngrandmother Titbottom has lived such a placid life, and has blessed us\nall with her sunny temper, when she has lived surrounded by such\nimages of peace.\n\n\"My grandfather died. But still, in the warm morning sunshine upon the\npiazza, I felt his placid presence, and as I crawled into his great\nchair, and drifted on in reverie through the still, tropical day, it\nwas as if his soft, dreamy eye had passed into my soul. My grandmother\ncherished his memory with tender regret. A violent passion of grief\nfor his loss was no more possible than for the pensive decay of the\nyear. We have no portrait of him, but I see always, when I remember\nhim, that peaceful and luxuriant palm. And I think that to have known\none good old man--one man who, through the chances and rubs of a long\nlife, has carried his heart in his hand, like a palm branch, waving\nall discords into peace, helps our faith in God, in ourselves, and in\neach other, more than many sermons. I hardly know whether to be\ngrateful to my grandfather for the spectacles; and yet when I remember\nthat it is to them I owe the pleasant image of him which I cherish, I\nseem to myself sadly ungrateful.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Titbottom to Prue, solemnly, \"my memory is a long and\ngloomy gallery, and only remotely, at its further end, do I see the\nglimmer of soft sunshine, and only there are the pleasant pictures\nhung. They seem to me very happy along whose gallery the sunlight\nstreams to their very feet, striking all the pictured walls into\nunfading splendor.\"\n\nPrue had laid her work in her lap, and as Titbottom paused a moment,\nand I turned towards her, I found her mild eyes fastened upon my face,\nand glistening with happy tears.\n\n\"Misfortunes of many kinds came heavily upon the family after the head\nwas gone. The great house was relinquished. My parents were both dead,\nand my grandmother had entire charge of me. But from the moment that I\nreceived the gift of the spectacles, I could not resist their\nfascination, and I withdrew into myself, and became a solitary boy.\nThere were not many companions for me of my own age, and they\ngradually left me, or, at least, had not a hearty sympathy with me;\nfor if they teased me I pulled out my spectacles and surveyed them so\nseriously that they acquired a kind of awe of me, and evidently\nregarded my grandfather's gift as a concealed magical weapon which\nmight be dangerously drawn upon them at any moment. Whenever, in our\ngames, there were quarrels and high words, and I began to feel about\nmy dress and to wear a grave look, they all took the alarm, and\nshouted, 'Look out for Titbottom's spectacles,' and scattered like a\nflock of scared sheep.\n\n\"Nor could I wonder at it. For, at first, before they took the alarm,\nI saw strange sights when I looked at them through the glasses. If two\nwere quarrelling about a marble or a ball, I had only to go behind a\ntree where I was concealed and look at them leisurely. Then the scene\nchanged, and no longer a green meadow with boys playing, but a spot\nwhich I did not recognize, and forms that made me shudder or smile. It\nwas not a big boy bullying a little one, but a young wolf with\nglistening teeth and a lamb cowering before him; or, it was a dog\nfaithful and famishing--or a star going slowly into eclipse--or a\nrainbow fading--or a flower blooming--or a sun rising--or a waning\nmoon. The revelations of the spectacles determined my feeling for the\nboys, and for all whom I saw through them. No shyness, nor\nawkwardness, nor silence, could separate me from those who looked\nlovely as lilies to my illuminated eyes. If I felt myself warmly drawn\nto any one I struggled with the fierce desire of seeing him through\nthe spectacles. I longed to enjoy the luxury of ignorant feeling, to\nlove without knowing, to float like a leaf upon the eddies of life,\ndrifted now to a sunny point, now to a solemn shade--now over\nglittering ripples, now over gleaming calms,--and not to determined\nports, a trim vessel with an inexorable rudder.\n\n\"But, sometimes, mastered after long struggles, I seized my spectacles\nand sauntered into the little town. Putting them to my eyes I peered\ninto the houses and at the people who passed me. Here sat a family at\nbreakfast, and I stood at the window looking in. O motley meal!\nfantastic vision! The good mother saw her lord sitting opposite, a\ngrave, respectable being, eating muffins. But I saw only a bank-bill,\nmore or less crumpled and tattered, marked with a larger or lesser\nfigure. If a sharp wind blew suddenly, I saw it tremble and flutter;\nit was thin, flat, impalpable. I removed my glasses, and looked with\nmy eyes at the wife. I could have smiled to see the humid tenderness\nwith which she regarded her strange _vis-a-vis_. Is life only a game\nof blind-man's-buff? of droll cross-purposes?\n\n\"Or I put them on again, and looked at the wife. How many stout trees\nI saw,--how many tender flowers,--how many placid pools; yes, and how\nmany little streams winding out of sight, shrinking before the large,\nhard, round eyes opposite, and slipping off into solitude and shade,\nwith a low, inner song for their own solace. And in many houses I\nthought to see angels, nymphs, or at least, women, and could only find\nbroomsticks, mops, or kettles, hurrying about, rattling, tinkling, in\na state of shrill activity. I made calls upon elegant ladies, and\nafter I had enjoyed the gloss of silk and the delicacy of lace, and\nthe flash of jewels, I slipped on my spectacles, and saw a peacock's\nfeather, flounced and furbelowed and fluttering; or an iron rod, thin,\nsharp, and hard; nor could I possibly mistake the movement of the\ndrapery for any flexibility of the thing draped,--or, mysteriously\nchilled, I saw a statue of perfect form, or flowing movement, it might\nbe alabaster, or bronze, or marble,--but sadly often it was ice; and I\nknew that after it had shone a little, and frozen a few eyes with its\ndespairing perfection, it could not be put away in the niches of\npalaces for ornament and proud family tradition, like the alabaster,\nor bronze, or marble statues, but would melt, and shrink, and fall\ncoldly away in colorless and useless water, be absorbed in the earth\nand utterly forgotten.\n\n\"But the true sadness was rather in seeing those who, not having the\nspectacles, thought that the iron rod was flexible, and the ice statue\nwarm. I saw many a gallant heart, which seemed to me brave and loyal\nas the crusaders sent by genuine and noble faith to Syria and the\nsepulchre, pursuing, through days and nights, and a long life of\ndevotion, the hope of lighting at least a smile in the cold eyes, if\nnot a fire in the icy heart. I watched the earnest, enthusiastic\nsacrifice. I saw the pure resolve, the generous faith, the fine scorn\nof doubt, the impatience of suspicion. I watched the grace, the ardor,\nthe glory of devotion. Through those strange spectacles how often I\nsaw the noblest heart renouncing all other hope, all other ambition,\nall other life, than the possible love of some one of those statues.\nAh! me, it was terrible, but they had not the love to give. The Parian\nface was so polished and smooth, because there was no sorrow upon the\nheart,--and, drearily often, no heart to be touched. I could not\nwonder that the noble heart of devotion was broken, for it had dashed\nitself against a stone. I wept, until my spectacles were dimmed for\nthat hopeless sorrow; but there was a pang beyond tears for those icy\nstatues.\n\n\"Still a boy, I was thus too much a man in knowledge,--I did not\ncomprehend the sights I was compelled to see. I used to tear my\nglasses away from my eyes, and, frightened at myself, run to escape my\nown consciousness. Reaching the small house where we then lived, I\nplunged into my grandmother's room and, throwing myself upon the\nfloor, buried my face in her lap; and sobbed myself to sleep with\npremature grief. But when I awakened, and felt her cool hand upon my\nhot forehead, and heard the low, sweet song, or the gentle story, or\nthe tenderly told parable from the Bible, with which she tried to\nsoothe me, I could not resist the mystic fascination that lured me, as\nI lay in her lap, to steal a glance at her through the spectacles.\n\n\"Pictures of the Madonna have not her rare and pensive beauty. Upon\nthe tranquil little islands her life had been eventless, and all the\nfine possibilities of her nature were like flowers that never bloomed.\nPlacid were all her years; yet I have read of no heroine, of no woman\ngreat in sudden crises, that it did not seem to me she might have\nbeen. The wife and widow of a man who loved his own home better than\nthe homes of others, I have yet heard of no queen, no belle, no\nimperial beauty, whom in grace, and brilliancy, and persuasive\ncourtesy, she might not have surpassed.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Titbottom to my wife, whose heart hung upon his story;\n\"your husband's young friend, Aurelia, wears sometimes a camelia in\nher hair, and no diamond in the ball-room seems so costly as that\nperfect flower, which women envy, and for whose least and withered\npetal men sigh; yet, in the tropical solitudes of Brazil, how many a\ncamelia bud drops from a bush that no eye has ever seen, which, had it\nflowered and been noticed, would have gilded all hearts with its\nmemory.\n\n\"When I stole these furtive glances at my grandmother, half fearing\nthat they were wrong, I saw only a calm lake, whose shores were low,\nand over which the sky hung unbroken, so that the least star was\nclearly reflected. It had an atmosphere of solemn twilight\ntranquillity, and so completely did its unruffled surface blend with\nthe cloudless, star-studded sky, that, when I looked through my\nspectacles at my grandmother, the vision seemed to me all heaven and\nstars. Yet, as I gazed and gazed, I felt what stately cities might\nwell have been built upon those shores, and have flashed prosperity\nover the calm, like coruscations of pearls.\n\n\"I dreamed of gorgeous fleets, silken sailed and blown by perfumed\nwinds, drifting over those depthless waters and through those spacious\nskies. I gazed upon the twilight, the inscrutable silence, like a\nGod-fearing discoverer upon a new, and vast, and dim sea, bursting\nupon him through forest glooms, and in the fervor of whose impassioned\ngaze, a millennial and poetic world arises, and man need no longer die\nto be happy.\n\n\"My companions naturally deserted me, for I had grown wearily grave\nand abstracted: and, unable to resist the allurement of my spectacles,\nI was constantly lost in a world, of which those companions were part,\nyet of which they knew nothing. I grew cold and hard, almost morose;\npeople seemed to me blind and unreasonable. They did the wrong thing.\nThey called green, yellow; and black, white. Young men said of a girl,\n'What a lovely, simple creature!' I looked, and there was only a\nglistening wisp of straw, dry and hollow. Or they said, 'What a cold,\nproud beauty!' I looked, and lo! a Madonna, whose heart held the\nworld. Or they said, 'What a wild, giddy girl!' and I saw a glancing,\ndancing mountain stream, pure as the virgin snows whence it flowed,\nsinging through sun and shade, over pearls and gold dust, slipping\nalong unstained by weed, or rain, or heavy foot of cattle, touching\nthe flowers with a dewy kiss,--a beam of grace, a happy song, a line\nof light, in the dim and troubled landscape.\n\n\"My grandmother sent me to school, but I looked at the master, and saw\nthat he was a smooth, round ferule--or an improper noun--or a vulgar\nfraction, and refused to obey him. Or he was a piece of string, a rag,\na willow-wand, and I had a contemptuous pity. But one was a well of\ncool, deep water, and looking suddenly in, one day, I saw the stars.\nHe gave me all my schooling. With him I used to walk by the sea, and,\nas we strolled and the waves plunged in long legions before us, I\nlooked at him through the spectacles, and as his eye dilated with the\nboundless view, and his chest heaved with an impossible desire, I saw\nXerxes and his army tossing and glittering, rank upon rank, multitude\nupon multitude, out of sight, but ever regularly advancing and with\nthe confused roar of ceaseless music, prostrating themselves in abject\nhomage. Or, as with arms outstretched and hair streaming on the wind,\nhe chanted full lines of the resounding Iliad, I saw Homer pacing the\nAEgean sands in the Greek sunsets of forgotten times.\n\n\"My grandmother died, and I was thrown into the world without\nresources, and with no capital but my spectacles. I tried to find\nemployment, but men were shy of me. There was a vague suspicion that I\nwas either a little crazed, or a good deal in league with the Prince\nof Darkness. My companions who would persist in calling a piece of\npainted muslin a fair and fragrant flower had no difficulty; success\nwaited for them around every corner, and arrived in every ship. I\ntried to teach, for I loved children. But if anything excited my\nsuspicion, and, putting on my spectacles, I saw that I was fondling a\nsnake, or smelling at a bud with a worm in it, I sprang up in horror\nand ran away; or, if it seemed to me through the glasses that a cherub\nsmiled upon me, or a rose was blooming in my buttonhole, then I felt\nmyself imperfect and impure, not fit to be leading and training what\nwas so essentially superior in quality to myself, and I kissed the\nchildren and left them weeping and wondering.\n\n\"In despair I went to a great merchant on the island, and asked him to\nemploy me.\n\n\"'My young friend,' said he, 'I understand that you have some singular\nsecret, some charm, or spell, or gift, or something, I don't know\nwhat, of which people are afraid. Now, you know, my dear,' said the\nmerchant, swelling up, and apparently prouder of his great stomach\nthan of his large fortune, 'I am not of that kind. I am not easily\nfrightened. You may spare yourself the pain of trying to impose upon\nme. People who propose to come to time before I arrive, are accustomed\nto arise very early in the morning,' said he, thrusting his thumbs in\nthe armholes of his waistcoat, and spreading the fingers, like two\nfans, upon his bosom. 'I think I have heard something of your secret.\nYou have a pair of spectacles, I believe, that you value very much,\nbecause your grandmother brought them as a marriage portion to your\ngrandfather. Now, if you think fit to sell me those spectacles, I will\npay you the largest market price for glasses. What do you say?'\n\n\"I told him that I had not the slightest idea of selling my\nspectacles.\n\n\"'My young friend means to eat them, I suppose,' said he with a\ncontemptuous smile.\n\n\"I made no reply, but was turning to leave the office, when the\nmerchant called after me--\n\n\"'My young friend, poor people should never suffer themselves to get\ninto pets. Anger is an expensive luxury, in which only men of a\ncertain income can indulge. A pair of spectacles and a hot temper are\nnot the most promising capital for success in life, Master Titbottom.'\n\n\"I said nothing, but put my hand upon the door to go out, when the\nmerchant said more respectfully,--\n\n\"'Well, you foolish boy, if you will not sell your spectacles, perhaps\nyou will agree to sell the use of them to me. That is, you shall only\nput them on when I direct you, and for my purposes. Hallo! you little\nfool!' cried he impatiently, as he saw that I intended to make no\nreply.\n\n\"But I had pulled out my spectacles, and put them on for my own\npurpose, and against his direction and desire. I looked at him, and\nsaw a huge bald-headed wild boar, with gross chops and a leering\neye--only the more ridiculous for the high-arched, gold-bowed\nspectacles, that straddled his nose. One of his fore hoofs was thrust\ninto the safe, where his bills payable were hived, and the other into\nhis pocket, among the loose change and bills there. His ears were\npricked forward with a brisk, sensitive smartness. In a world where\nprize pork was the best excellence, he would have carried off all the\npremiums.\n\n\"I stepped into the next office in the street, and a mild-faced,\ngenial man, also a large and opulent merchant, asked me my business in\nsuch a tone, that I instantly looked through my spectacles, and saw a\nland flowing with milk and honey. There I pitched my tent, and stayed\ntill the good man died, and his business was discontinued.\n\n\"But while there,\" said Titbottom, and his voice trembled away into a\nsigh, \"I first saw Preciosa. Spite of the spectacles, I saw Preciosa.\nFor days, for weeks, for months, I did not take my spectacles with me.\nI ran away from them, I threw them up on high shelves, I tried to make\nup my mind to throw them into the sea, or down the well. I could not,\nI would not, I dared not look at Preciosa through the spectacles. It\nwas not possible for me deliberately to destroy them; but I awoke in\nthe night, and could almost have cursed my dear old grandfather for\nhis gift. I escaped from the office, and sat for whole days with\nPreciosa. I told her the strange things I had seen with my mystic\nglasses. The hours were not enough for the wild romances which I raved\nin her ear. She listened, astonished and appalled. Her blue eyes\nturned upon me with a sweet deprecation. She clung to me, and then\nwithdrew, and fled fearfully from the room. But she could not stay\naway. She could not resist my voice, in whose tones burned all the\nlove that filled my heart and brain. The very effort to resist the\ndesire of seeing her as I saw everybody else, gave a frenzy and an\nunnatural tension to my feeling and my manner. I sat by her side,\nlooking into her eyes, smoothing her hair, folding her to my heart,\nwhich was sunken and deep--why not forever?--in that dream of peace. I\nran from her presence, and shouted, and leaped with joy, and sat the\nwhole night through, thrilled into happiness by the thought of her\nlove and loveliness, like a wind-harp, tightly strung, and answering\nthe airiest sigh of the breeze with music. Then came calmer days--the\nconviction of deep love settled upon our lives--as after the hurrying,\nheaving days of spring, comes the bland and benignant summer.\n\n\"'It is no dream, then, after all, and we are happy,' I said to her,\none day; and there came no answer, for happiness is speechless.\n\n\"We are happy then,\" I said to myself, \"there is no excitement now.\nHow glad I am that I can now look at her through my spectacles.\"\n\n\"I feared lest some instinct should warn me to beware.\nI escaped from her arms, and ran home and seized the glasses and\nbounded back again to Preciosa. As I entered the room I was heated, my\nhead was swimming with confused apprehension, my eyes must have\nglared. Preciosa was frightened, and rising from her seat, stood with\nan inquiring glance of surprise in her eyes. But I was bent with\nfrenzy upon my purpose. I was merely aware that she was in the room. I\nsaw nothing else. I heard nothing. I cared for nothing, but to see her\nthrough that magic glass, and feel at once, all the fulness of\nblissful perfection which that would reveal. Preciosa stood before the\nmirror, but alarmed at my wild and eager movements, unable to\ndistinguish what I had in my hands, and seeing me raise them suddenly\nto my face, she shrieked with terror, and fell fainting upon the\nfloor, at the very moment that I placed the glasses before my eyes,\nand beheld--myself, reflected in the mirror, before which she had been\nstanding.\n\n\"Dear madam,\" cried Titbottom, to my wife, springing up and falling\nback again in his chair, pale and trembling, while Prue ran to him and\ntook his hand, and I poured out a glass of water--\"I saw myself.\"\n\nThere was silence for many minutes. Prue laid her hand gently upon the\nhead of our guest, whose eyes were closed, and who breathed softly,\nlike an infant in sleeping. Perhaps, in all the long years of anguish\nsince that hour, no tender hand had touched his brow, nor wiped away\nthe damps of a bitter sorrow. Perhaps the tender, maternal fingers of\nmy wife soothed his weary head with the conviction that he felt the\nhand of his mother playing with the long hair of her boy in the soft\nWest Indian morning. Perhaps it was only the natural relief of\nexpressing a pent-up sorrow. When he spoke again, it was with the old,\nsubdued tone, and the air of quaint solemnity.\n\n\"These things were matters of long, long ago, and I came to this\ncountry soon after. I brought with me, premature age, a past of\nmelancholy memories, and the magic spectacles. I had become their\nslave. I had nothing more to fear. Having seen myself, I was compelled\nto see others, properly to understand my relations to them. The lights\nthat cheer the future of other men had gone out for me. My eyes were\nthose of an exile turned backwards upon the receding shore, and not\nforwards with hope upon the ocean. I mingled with men, but with little\npleasure. There are but many varieties of a few types. I did not find\nthose I came to clearer sighted than those I had left behind. I heard\nmen called shrewd and wise, and report said they were highly\nintelligent and successful. But when I looked at them through my\nglasses, I found no halo of real manliness. My finest sense detected\nno aroma of purity and principle; but I saw only a fungus that had\nfattened and spread in a night. They all went to the theater to see\nactors upon the stage. I went to see actors in the boxes, so\nconsummately cunning, that the others did not know they were acting,\nand they did not suspect it themselves.\n\n\"Perhaps you wonder it did not make me misanthropical. My dear\nfriends, do not forget that I had seen myself. It made me\ncompassionate, not cynical. Of course I could not value highly the\nordinary standards of success and excellence. When I went to church\nand saw a thin, blue, artificial flower, or a great sleepy cushion\nexpounding the beauty of holiness to pews full of eagles, half-eagles,\nand threepences, however adroitly concealed in broadcloth and boots:\nor saw an onion in an Easter bonnet weeping over the sins of Magdalen,\nI did not feel as they felt who saw in all this, not only propriety,\nbut piety. Or when at public meetings an eel stood up on end, and\nwriggled and squirmed lithely in every direction, and declared that,\nfor his part, he went in for rainbows and hot water--how could I help\nseeing that he was still black and loved a slimy pool?\n\n\"I could not grow misanthropical when I saw in the eyes of so many who\nwere called old, the gushing fountains of eternal youth, and the light\nof an immortal dawn, or when I saw those who were esteemed\nunsuccessful and aimless, ruling a fair realm of peace and plenty,\neither in themselves, or more perfectly in another--a realm and\nprincely possession for which they had well renounced a hopeless\nsearch and a belated triumph. I knew one man who had been for years a\nby-word for having sought the philosopher's stone. But I looked at him\nthrough the spectacles and saw a satisfaction in concentrated\nenergies, and a tenacity arising from devotion to a noble dream, which\nwas not apparent in the youths who pitied him in the aimless\neffeminacy of clubs, nor in the clever gentlemen who cracked their\nthin jokes upon him over a gossiping dinner.\n\n\"And there was your neighbor over the way, who passes for a woman who\nhas failed in her career, because she is an old maid. People wag\nsolemn heads of pity, and say that she made so great a mistake in not\nmarrying the brilliant and famous man who was for long years her\nsuitor. It is clear that no orange flower will ever bloom for her. The\nyoung people make tender romances about her as they watch her, and\nthink of her solitary hours of bitter regret, and wasting longing,\nnever to be satisfied. When I first came to town I shared this\nsympathy, and pleased my imagination with fancying her hard struggle\nwith the conviction that she had lost all that made life beautiful. I\nsupposed that if I looked at her through my spectacles, I should see\nthat it was only her radiant temper which so illuminated her dress,\nthat we did not see it to be heavy sables. But when, one day, I did\nraise my glasses and glanced at her, I did not see the old maid whom\nwe all pitied for a secret sorrow, but a woman whose nature was a\ntropic, in which the sun shone, and birds sang, and flowers bloomed\nforever. There were no regrets, no doubts and half wishes, but a calm\nsweetness, a transparent peace. I saw her blush when that old lover\npassed by, or paused to speak to her, but it was only the sign of\ndelicate feminine consciousness. She knew his love, and honored it,\nalthough she could not understand it nor return it. I looked closely\nat her, and I saw that although all the world had exclaimed at her\nindifference to such homage, and had declared it was astonishing she\nshould lose so fine a match, she would only say simply and quietly--\n\n\"'If Shakespeare loved me and I did not love him, how could I marry\nhim?'\n\n\"Could I be misanthropical when I saw such fidelity, and dignity, and\nsimplicity?\n\n\"You may believe that I was especially curious to look at that old\nlover of hers, through my glasses. He was no longer young, you know,\nwhen I came, and his fame and fortune were secure. Certainly I have\nheard of few men more beloved, and of none more worthy to be loved. He\nhad the easy manner of a man of the world, the sensitive grace of a\npoet, and the charitable judgment of a wide traveller. He was\naccounted the most successful and most unspoiled of men. Handsome,\nbrilliant, wise, tender, graceful, accomplished, rich, and famous, I\nlooked at him, without the spectacles, in surprise, and admiration,\nand wondered how your neighbor over the way had been so entirely\nuntouched by his homage. I watched their intercourse in society, I saw\nher gay smile, her cordial greeting; I marked his frank address, his\nlofty courtesy. Their manner told no tales. The eager world was\nbalked, and I pulled out my spectacles.\n\n\"I had seen her, already, and now I saw him. He lived only in memory,\nand his memory was a spacious and stately palace. But he did not\noftenest frequent the banqueting hall, where were endless hospitality\nand feasting--nor did he loiter much in reception rooms, where a\nthrong of new visitors was forever swarming--nor did he feed his\nvanity by haunting the apartment in which were stored the trophies of\nhis varied triumphs--nor dream much in the great gallery hung with\npictures of his travels. But from all these lofty halls of memory he\nconstantly escaped to a remote and solitary chamber, into which no one\nhad ever penetrated. But my fatal eyes, behind the glasses, followed\nand entered with him, and saw that the chamber was a chapel. It was\ndim, and silent, and sweet with perpetual incense that burned upon an\naltar before a picture forever veiled. There, whenever I chanced to\nlook, I saw him kneel and pray; and there, by day and by night, a\nfuneral hymn was chanted.\n\n\"I do not believe you will be surprised that I have been content to\nremain deputy bookkeeper. My spectacles regulated my ambition, and I\nearly learned that there were better gods than Plutus. The glasses\nhave lost much of their fascination now, and I do not often use them.\nSometimes the desire is irresistible. Whenever I am greatly\ninterested, I am compelled to take them out and see what it is that I\nadmire.\n\n\"And yet--and yet,\" said Titbottom, after a pause, \"I am not sure that\nI thank my grandfather.\"\n\nPrue had long since laid away her work, and had heard every word of\nthe story. I saw that the dear woman had yet one question to ask, and\nhad been earnestly hoping to hear something that would spare her the\nnecessity of asking. But Titbottom had resumed his usual tone, after\nthe momentary excitement, and made no further allusion to himself. We\nall sat silently; Titbottom's eyes fastened musingly upon the carpet:\nPrue looking wistfully at him, and I regarding both.\n\nIt was past midnight, and our guest arose to go. He shook hands\nquietly, made his grave Spanish bow to Prue, and taking his hat, went\ntowards the front door. Prue and I accompanied him. I saw in her eyes\nthat she would ask her question. And as Titbottom opened the door, I\nheard the low words:\n\n\"And Preciosa?\"\n\nTitbottom paused. He had just opened the door and the moonlight\nstreamed over him as he stood, turning back to us.\n\n\"I have seen her but once since. It was in church, and she was\nkneeling with her eyes closed, so that she did not see me. But I\nrubbed the glasses well, and looked at her, and saw a white lily,\nwhose stem was broken, but which was fresh; and luminous, and\nfragrant, still.\"\n\n\"That was a miracle,\" interrupted Prue.\n\n\"Madam, it was a miracle,\" replied Titbottom, \"and for that one sight\nI am devoutly grateful for my grandfather's gift. I saw, that although\na flower may have lost its hold upon earthly moisture, it may still\nbloom as sweetly, fed by the dews of heaven.\"\n\nThe door closed, and he was gone. But as Prue put her arm in mine and\nwe went upstairs together, she whispered in my ear:\n\n\"How glad I am that you don't wear spectacles.\"\n\n\n\nMY DOUBLE; AND HOW HE UNDID ME\n\nBy Edward Everett Hale (1822-1909)\n\n[From _The Atlantic Monthly_, September, 1859. Republished in the\nvolume, _The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales_ (1868), by Edward\nEverett Hale (Little, Brown & Co.).]\n\nIt is not often that I trouble the readers of _The Atlantic Monthly_.\nI should not trouble them now, but for the importunities of my wife,\nwho \"feels to insist\" that a duty to society is unfulfilled, till I\nhave told why I had to have a double, and how he undid me. She is\nsure, she says, that intelligent persons cannot understand that\npressure upon public servants which alone drives any man into the\nemployment of a double. And while I fear she thinks, at the bottom of\nher heart, that my fortunes will never be re-made, she has a faint\nhope, that, as another Rasselas, I may teach a lesson to future\npublics, from which they may profit, though we die. Owing to the\nbehavior of my double, or, if you please, to that public pressure\nwhich compelled me to employ him, I have plenty of leisure to write\nthis communication.\n\nI am, or rather was, a minister, of the Sandemanian connection. I was\nsettled in the active, wide-awake town of Naguadavick, on one of the\nfinest water-powers in Maine. We used to call it a Western town in the\nheart of the civilization of New England. A charming place it was and\nis. A spirited, brave young parish had I; and it seemed as if we might\nhave all \"the joy of eventful living\" to our hearts' content.\n\nAlas! how little we knew on the day of my ordination, and in those\nhalcyon moments of our first housekeeping! To be the confidential\nfriend in a hundred families in the town--cutting the social trifle,\nas my friend Haliburton says, \"from the top of the whipped-syllabub to\nthe bottom of the sponge-cake, which is the foundation\"--to keep\nabreast of the thought of the age in one's study, and to do one's best\non Sunday to interweave that thought with the active life of an active\ntown, and to inspirit both and make both infinite by glimpses of the\nEternal Glory, seemed such an exquisite forelook into one's life!\nEnough to do, and all so real and so grand! If this vision could only\nhave lasted.\n\nThe truth is, that this vision was not in itself a delusion, nor,\nindeed, half bright enough. If one could only have been left to do his\nown business, the vision would have accomplished itself and brought\nout new paraheliacal visions, each as bright as the original. The\nmisery was and is, as we found out, I and Polly, before long, that,\nbesides the vision, and besides the usual human and finite failures in\nlife (such as breaking the old pitcher that came over in the\nMayflower, and putting into the fire the alpenstock with which her\nfather climbed Mont Blanc)--besides, these, I say (imitating the style\nof Robinson Crusoe), there were pitchforked in on us a great\nrowen-heap of humbugs, handed down from some unknown seed-time, in\nwhich we were expected, and I chiefly, to fulfil certain public\nfunctions before the community, of the character of those fulfilled by\nthe third row of supernumeraries who stand behind the Sepoys in the\nspectacle of the _Cataract of the Ganges_. They were the duties, in a\nword, which one performs as member of one or another social class or\nsubdivision, wholly distinct from what one does as A. by himself A.\nWhat invisible power put these functions on me, it would be very hard\nto tell. But such power there was and is. And I had not been at work a\nyear before I found I was living two lives, one real and one merely\nfunctional--for two sets of people, one my parish, whom I loved, and\nthe other a vague public, for whom I did not care two straws. All this\nwas in a vague notion, which everybody had and has, that this second\nlife would eventually bring out some great results, unknown at\npresent, to somebody somewhere.\n\nCrazed by this duality of life, I first read Dr. Wigan on the _Duality\nof the Brain_, hoping that I could train one side of my head to do\nthese outside jobs, and the other to do my intimate and real duties.\nFor Richard Greenough once told me that, in studying for the statue of\nFranklin, he found that the left side of the great man's face was\nphilosophic and reflective, and the right side funny and smiling. If\nyou will go and look at the bronze statue, you will find he has\nrepeated this observation there for posterity. The eastern profile is\nthe portrait of the statesman Franklin, the western of Poor Richard.\nBut Dr. Wigan does not go into these niceties of this subject, and I\nfailed. It was then that, on my wife's suggestion, I resolved to look\nout for a Double.\n\nI was, at first, singularly successful. We happened to be recreating\nat Stafford Springs that summer. We rode out one day, for one of the\nrelaxations of that watering-place, to the great Monsonpon House. We\nwere passing through one of the large halls, when my destiny was\nfulfilled! I saw my man!\n\nHe was not shaven. He had on no spectacles. He was dressed in a green\nbaize roundabout and faded blue overalls, worn sadly at the knee. But\nI saw at once that he was of my height, five feet four and a half. He\nhad black hair, worn off by his hat. So have and have not I. He\nstooped in walking. So do I. His hands were large, and mine.\nAnd--choicest gift of Fate in all--he had, not \"a strawberry-mark on\nhis left arm,\" but a cut from a juvenile brickbat over his right eye,\nslightly affecting the play of that eyebrow. Reader, so have I!--My\nfate was sealed!\n\nA word with Mr. Holley, one of the inspectors, settled the whole\nthing. It proved that this Dennis Shea was a harmless, amiable fellow,\nof the class known as shiftless, who had sealed his fate by marrying a\ndumb wife, who was at that moment ironing in the laundry. Before I\nleft Stafford, I had hired both for five years. We had applied to\nJudge Pynchon, then the probate judge at Springfield, to change the\nname of Dennis Shea to Frederic Ingham. We had explained to the Judge,\nwhat was the precise truth, that an eccentric gentleman wished to\nadopt Dennis under this new name into his family. It never occurred to\nhim that Dennis might be more than fourteen years old. And thus, to\nshorten this preface, when we returned at night to my parsonage at\nNaguadavick, there entered Mrs. Ingham, her new dumb laundress,\nmyself, who am Mr. Frederic Ingham, and my double, who was Mr.\nFrederic Ingham by as good right as I.\n\nOh, the fun we had the next morning in shaving his beard to my\npattern, cutting his hair to match mine, and teaching him how to wear\nand how to take off gold-bowed spectacles! Really, they were\nelectroplate, and the glass was plain (for the poor fellow's eyes were\nexcellent). Then in four successive afternoons I taught him four\nspeeches. I had found these would be quite enough for the\nsupernumerary-Sepoy line of life, and it was well for me they were.\nFor though he was good-natured, he was very shiftless, and it was, as\nour national proverb says, \"like pulling teeth\" to teach him. But at\nthe end of the next week he could say, with quite my easy and frisky\nair:\n\n1. \"Very well, thank you. And you?\" This for an answer to casual\nsalutations.\n\n2. \"I am very glad you liked it.\"\n\n3. \"There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well said, that\nI will not occupy the time.\"\n\n4. \"I agree, in general, with my friend on the other side of the\nroom.\"\n\nAt first I had a feeling that I was going to be at great cost for\nclothing him. But it proved, of course, at once, that, whenever he was\nout, I should be at home. And I went, during the bright period of his\nsuccess, to so few of those awful pageants which require a black\ndress-coat and what the ungodly call, after Mr. Dickens, a white\nchoker, that in the happy retreat of my own dressing-gowns and jackets\nmy days went by as happily and cheaply as those of another Thalaba.\nAnd Polly declares there was never a year when the tailoring cost so\nlittle. He lived (Dennis, not Thalaba) in his wife's room over the\nkitchen. He had orders never to show himself at that window. When he\nappeared in the front of the house, I retired to my sanctissimum and\nmy dressing-gown. In short, the Dutchman and, his wife, in the old\nweather-box, had not less to do with, each other than he and I. He\nmade the furnace-fire and split the wood before daylight; then he went\nto sleep again, and slept late; then came for orders, with a red silk\nbandanna tied round his head, with his overalls on, and his dress-coat\nand spectacles off. If we happened to be interrupted, no one guessed\nthat he was Frederic Ingham as well as I; and, in the neighborhood,\nthere grew up an impression that the minister's Irishman worked\nday-times in the factory village at New Coventry. After I had given\nhim his orders, I never saw him till the next day.\n\nI launched him by sending him to a meeting of the Enlightenment Board.\nThe Enlightenment Board consists of seventy-four members, of whom\nsixty-seven are necessary to form a quorum. One becomes a member under\nthe regulations laid down in old Judge Dudley's will. I became one by\nbeing ordained pastor of a church in Naguadavick. You see you cannot\nhelp yourself, if you would. At this particular time we had had four\nsuccessive meetings, averaging four hours each--wholly occupied in\nwhipping in a quorum. At the first only eleven men were present; at\nthe next, by force of three circulars, twenty-seven; at the third,\nthanks to two days' canvassing by Auchmuty and myself, begging men to\ncome, we had sixty. Half the others were in Europe. But without a\nquorum we could do nothing. All the rest of us waited grimly for our\nfour hours, and adjourned without any action. At the fourth meeting we\nhad flagged, and only got fifty-nine together. But on the first\nappearance of my double--whom I sent on this fatal Monday to the fifth\nmeeting--he was the _sixty-seventh_ man who entered the room. He was\ngreeted with a storm of applause! The poor fellow had missed his\nway--read the street signs ill through his spectacles (very ill, in\nfact, without them)--and had not dared to inquire. He entered the\nroom--finding the president and secretary holding to their chairs two\njudges of the Supreme Court, who were also members _ex officio_, and\nwere begging leave to go away. On his entrance all was changed.\n_Presto_, the by-laws were amended, and the Western property was given\naway. Nobody stopped to converse with him. He voted, as I had charged\nhim to do, in every instance, with the minority. I won new laurels as\na man of sense, though a little unpunctual--and Dennis, _alias_\nIngham, returned to the parsonage, astonished to see with how little\nwisdom the world is governed. He cut a few of my parishioners in the\nstreet; but he had his glasses off, and I am known to be nearsighted.\nEventually he recognized them more readily than I.\n\nI \"set him again\" at the exhibition of the New Coventry Academy; and\nhere he undertook a \"speaking part\"--as, in my boyish, worldly days, I\nremember the bills used to say of Mlle. Celeste. We are all trustees\nof the New Coventry Academy; and there has lately been \"a good deal of\nfeeling\" because the Sandemanian trustees did not regularly attend the\nexhibitions. It has been intimated, indeed, that the Sandemanians are\nleaning towards Free-Will, and that we have, therefore, neglected\nthese semi-annual exhibitions, while there is no doubt that Auchmuty\nlast year went to Commencement at Waterville. Now the head master at\nNew Coventry is a real good fellow, who knows a Sanskrit root when he\nsees it, and often cracks etymologies with me--so that, in strictness,\nI ought to go to their exhibitions. But think, reader, of sitting\nthrough three long July days in that Academy chapel, following the\nprogram from\n\n  Tuesday Morning. English Composition. Sunshine. Miss Jones,\n\nround to\n\n  Trio on Three Pianos. Duel from opera of Midshipman Easy. Marryatt.\n\ncoming in at nine, Thursday evening! Think of this, reader, for men\nwho know the world is trying to go backward, and who would give their\nlives if they could help it on! Well! The double had succeeded so well\nat the Board, that I sent him to the Academy. (Shade of Plato,\npardon!) He arrived early on Tuesday, when, indeed, few but mothers\nand clergymen are generally expected, and returned in the evening to\nus, covered with honors. He had dined at the right hand of the\nchairman, and he spoke in high terms of the repast. The chairman had\nexpressed his interest in the French conversation. \"I am very glad you\nliked it,\" said Dennis; and the poor chairman, abashed, supposed the\naccent had been wrong. At the end of the day, the gentlemen present\nhad been called upon for speeches--the Rev. Frederic Ingham first, as\nit happened; upon which Dennis had risen, and had said, \"There has\nbeen so much said, and, on the whole, so well said, that I will not\noccupy the time.\" The girls were delighted, because Dr. Dabney, the\nyear before, had given them at this occasion a scolding on impropriety\nof behavior at lyceum lectures. They all declared Mr. Ingham was a\nlove--and _so_ handsome! (Dennis is good-looking.) Three of them, with\narms behind the others' waists, followed him up to the wagon he rode\nhome in; and a little girl with a blue sash had been sent to give him\na rosebud. After this debut in speaking, he went to the exhibition for\ntwo days more, to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned. Indeed,\nPolly reported that he had pronounced the trustees' dinners of a\nhigher grade than those of the parsonage. When the next term began, I\nfound six of the Academy girls had obtained permission to come across\nthe river and attend our church. But this arrangement did not long\ncontinue.\n\nAfter this he went to several Commencements for me, and ate the\ndinners provided; he sat through three of our Quarterly Conventions\nfor me--always voting judiciously, by the simple rule mentioned above,\nof siding with the minority. And I, meanwhile, who had before been\nlosing caste among my friends, as holding myself aloof from the\nassociations of the body, began to rise in everybody's favor.\n\"Ingham's a good fellow--always on hand\"; \"never talks much--but does\nthe right thing at the right time\"; \"is not as unpunctual as he used\nto be--he comes early, and sits through to the end.\" \"He has got over\nhis old talkative habit, too. I spoke to a friend of his about it\nonce; and I think Ingham took it kindly,\" etc., etc.\n\nThis voting power of Dennis was particularly valuable at the quarterly\nmeetings of the Proprietors of the Naguadavick Ferry. My wife\ninherited from her father some shares in that enterprise, which is not\nyet fully developed, though it doubtless will become a very valuable\nproperty. The law of Maine then forbade stockholders to appear by\nproxy at such meetings. Polly disliked to go, not being, in fact, a\n\"hens'-rights hen,\" and transferred her stock to me. I, after going\nonce, disliked it more than she. But Dennis went to the next meeting,\nand liked it very much. He said the armchairs were good, the collation\ngood, and the free rides to stockholders pleasant. He was a little\nfrightened when they first took him upon one of the ferry-boats, but\nafter two or three quarterly meetings he became quite brave.\n\nThus far I never had any difficulty with him. Indeed, being of that\ntype which is called shiftless, he was only too happy to be told daily\nwhat to do, and to be charged not to be forthputting or in any way\noriginal in his discharge of that duty. He learned, however, to\ndiscriminate between the lines of his life, and very much preferred\nthese stockholders' meetings and trustees' dinners and commencement\ncollations to another set of occasions, from which he used to beg off\nmost piteously. Our excellent brother, Dr. Fillmore, had taken a\nnotion at this time that our Sandemanian churches needed more\nexpression of mutual sympathy. He insisted upon it that we were\nremiss. He said, that, if the Bishop came to preach at Naguadavick,\nall the Episcopal clergy of the neighborhood were present; if Dr. Pond\ncame, all the Congregational clergymen turned out to hear him; if Dr.\nNichols, all the Unitarians; and he thought we owed it to each other\nthat, whenever there was an occasional service at a Sandemanian\nchurch, the other brethren should all, if possible, attend. \"It looked\nwell,\" if nothing more. Now this really meant that I had not been to\nhear one of Dr. Fillmore's lectures on the Ethnology of Religion. He\nforgot that he did not hear one of my course on the Sandemanianism of\nAnselm. But I felt badly when he said it; and afterwards I always made\nDennis go to hear all the brethren preach, when I was not preaching\nmyself. This was what he took exceptions to--the only thing, as I\nsaid, which he ever did except to. Now came the advantage of his long\nmorning-nap, and of the green tea with which Polly supplied the\nkitchen. But he would plead, so humbly, to be let off, only from one\nor two! I never excepted him, however. I knew the lectures were of\nvalue, and I thought it best he should be able to keep the connection.\n\nPolly is more rash than I am, as the reader has observed in the outset\nof this memoir. She risked Dennis one night under the eyes of her own\nsex. Governor Gorges had always been very kind to us; and when he gave\nhis great annual party to the town, asked us. I confess I hated to go.\nI was deep in the new volume of Pfeiffer's _Mystics_, which Haliburton\nhad just sent me from Boston. \"But how rude,\" said Polly, \"not to\nreturn the Governor's civility and Mrs. Gorges's, when they will be\nsure to ask why you are away!\" Still I demurred, and at last she, with\nthe wit of Eve and of Semiramis conjoined, let me off by saying that,\nif I would go in with her, and sustain the initial conversations with\nthe Governor and the ladies staying there, she would risk Dennis for\nthe rest of the evening. And that was just what we did. She took\nDennis in training all that afternoon, instructed him in fashionable\nconversation, cautioned him against the temptations of the\nsupper-table--and at nine in the evening he drove us all down in the\ncarryall. I made the grand star-entree with Polly and the pretty\nWalton girls, who were staying with us. We had put Dennis into a great\nrough top-coat, without his glasses--and the girls never dreamed, in\nthe darkness, of looking at him. He sat in the carriage, at the door,\nwhile we entered. I did the agreeable to Mrs. Gorges, was introduced\nto her niece. Miss Fernanda--I complimented Judge Jeffries on his\ndecision in the great case of D'Aulnay _vs._ Laconia Mining Co.--I\nstepped into the dressing-room for a moment--stepped out for\nanother--walked home, after a nod with Dennis, and tying the horse to\na pump--and while I walked home, Mr. Frederic Ingham, my double,\nstepped in through the library into the Gorges's grand saloon.\n\nOh! Polly died of laughing as she told me of it at midnight! And even\nhere, where I have to teach my hands to hew the beech for stakes to\nfence our cave, she dies of laughing as she recalls it--and says that\nsingle occasion was worth all we have paid for it. Gallant Eve that\nshe is! She joined Dennis at the library door, and in an instant\npresented him to Dr. Ochterlong, from Baltimore, who was on a visit in\ntown, and was talking with her, as Dennis came in. \"Mr. Ingham would\nlike to hear what you were telling us about your success among the\nGerman population.\" And Dennis bowed and said, in spite of a scowl\nfrom Polly, \"I'm very glad you liked it.\" But Dr. Ochterlong did not\nobserve, and plunged into the tide of explanation, Dennis listening\nlike a prime-minister, and bowing like a mandarin--which is, I\nsuppose, the same thing. Polly declared it was just like Haliburton's\nLatin conversation with the Hungarian minister, of which he is very\nfond of telling. \"_Quoene sit historia Reformationis in Ungaria?_\"\nquoth Haliburton, after some thought. And his _confrere_ replied\ngallantly, \"_In seculo decimo tertio,_\" etc., etc., etc.; and from\n_decimo tertio_ [Which means, \"In the thirteenth century,\" my dear\nlittle bell-and-coral reader. You have rightly guessed that the\nquestion means, \"What is the history of the Reformation in Hungary?\"]\nto the nineteenth century and a half lasted till the oysters came. So\nwas it that before Dr. Ochterlong came to the \"success,\" or near it,\nGovernor Gorges came to Dennis and asked him to hand Mrs. Jeffries\ndown to supper, a request which he heard with great joy.\n\nPolly was skipping round the room, I guess, gay as a lark. Auchmuty\ncame to her \"in pity for poor Ingham,\" who was so bored by the stupid\npundit--and Auchmuty could not understand why I stood it so long. But\nwhen Dennis took Mrs. Jeffries down, Polly could not resist standing\nnear them. He was a little flustered, till the sight of the eatables\nand drinkables gave him the same Mercian courage which it gave\nDiggory. A little excited then, he attempted one or two of his\nspeeches to the Judge's lady. But little he knew how hard it was to\nget in even a _promptu_ there edgewise. \"Very well, I thank you,\" said\nhe, after the eating elements were adjusted; \"and you?\" And then did\nnot he have to hear about the mumps, and the measles, and arnica, and\nbelladonna, and chamomile-flower, and dodecathem, till she changed\noysters for salad--and then about the old practice and the new, and\nwhat her sister said, and what her sister's friend said, and what the\nphysician to her sister's friend said, and then what was said by the\nbrother of the sister of the physician of the friend of her sister,\nexactly as if it had been in Ollendorff? There was a moment's pause,\nas she declined champagne. \"I am very glad you liked it,\" said Dennis\nagain, which he never should have said, but to one who complimented a\nsermon. \"Oh! you are so sharp, Mr. Ingham! No! I never drink any wine\nat all--except sometimes in summer a little currant spirits--from our\nown currants, you know. My own mother--that is, I call her my own\nmother, because, you know, I do not remember,\" etc., etc., etc.; till\nthey came to the candied orange at the end of the feast--when Dennis,\nrather confused, thought he must say something, and tried No. 4--\"I\nagree, in general, with my friend the other side of the room\"--which\nhe never should have said but at a public meeting. But Mrs. Jeffries,\nwho never listens expecting to understand, caught him up instantly\nwith, \"Well, I'm sure my husband returns the compliment; he always\nagrees with you--though we do worship with the Methodists--but you\nknow, Mr. Ingham,\" etc., etc., etc., till the move was made upstairs;\nand as Dennis led her through the hall, he was scarcely understood by\nany but Polly, as he said, \"There has been so much said, and, on the\nwhole, so well said, that I will not occupy the time.\"\n\nHis great resource the rest of the evening was standing in the\nlibrary, carrying on animated conversations with one and another in\nmuch the same way. Polly had initiated him in the mysteries of a\ndiscovery of mine, that it is not necessary to finish your sentence in\na crowd, but by a sort of mumble, omitting sibilants and dentals.\nThis, indeed, if your words fail you, answers even in public extempore\nspeech--but better where other talking is going on. Thus: \"We missed\nyou at the Natural History Society, Ingham.\" Ingham replies: \"I am\nvery gligloglum, that is, that you were m-m-m-m-m.\" By gradually\ndropping the voice, the interlocutor is compelled to supply the\nanswer. \"Mrs. Ingham, I hope your friend Augusta is better.\" Augusta\nhas not been ill. Polly cannot think of explaining, however, and\nanswers: \"Thank you, ma'am; she is very rearason wewahwewob,\" in lower\nand lower tones. And Mrs. Throckmorton, who forgot the subject of\nwhich she spoke, as soon as she asked the question, is quite\nsatisfied. Dennis could see into the card-room, and came to Polly to\nask if he might not go and play all-fours. But, of course, she sternly\nrefused. At midnight they came home delightedly: Polly, as I said,\nwild to tell me the story of victory; only both the pretty Walton\ngirls said: \"Cousin Frederic, you did not come near me all the\nevening.\"\n\nWe always called him Dennis at home, for convenience, though his real\nname was Frederic Ingham, as I have explained. When the election day\ncame round, however, I found that by some accident there was only one\nFrederic Ingham's name on the voting-list; and, as I was quite busy\nthat day in writing some foreign letters to Halle, I thought I would\nforego my privilege of suffrage, and stay quietly at home, telling\nDennis that he might use the record on the voting-list and vote. I\ngave him a ticket, which I told him he might use, if he liked to. That\nwas that very sharp election in Maine which the readers of _The\nAtlantic_ so well remember, and it had been intimated in public that\nthe ministers would do well not to appear at the polls. Of course,\nafter that, we had to appear by self or proxy. Still, Naguadavick was\nnot then a city, and this standing in a double queue at townmeeting\nseveral hours to vote was a bore of the first water; and so, when I\nfound that there was but one Frederic Ingham on the list, and that one\nof us must give up, I stayed at home and finished the letters (which,\nindeed, procured for Fothergill his coveted appointment of Professor\nof Astronomy at Leavenworth), and I gave Dennis, as we called him, the\nchance. Something in the matter gave a good deal of popularity to the\nFrederic Ingham name; and at the adjourned election, next week,\nFrederic Ingham was chosen to the legislature. Whether this was I or\nDennis, I never really knew. My friends seemed to think it was I; but\nI felt, that, as Dennis had done the popular thing, he was entitled to\nthe honor; so I sent him to Augusta when the time came, and he took\nthe oaths. And a very valuable member he made. They appointed him on\nthe Committee on Parishes; but I wrote a letter for him, resigning, on\nthe ground that he took an interest in our claim to the stumpage in\nthe minister's sixteenths of Gore A, next No. 7, in the 10th Range. He\nnever made any speeches, and always voted with the minority, which was\nwhat he was sent to do. He made me and himself a great many good\nfriends, some of whom I did not afterwards recognize as quickly as\nDennis did my parishioners. On one or two occasions, when there was\nwood to saw at home, I kept him at home; but I took those occasions to\ngo to Augusta myself. Finding myself often in his vacant seat at these\ntimes, I watched the proceedings with a good deal of care; and once\nwas so much excited that I delivered my somewhat celebrated speech on\nthe Central School District question, a speech of which the State of\nMaine printed some extra copies. I believe there is no formal rule\npermitting strangers to speak; but no one objected.\n\nDennis himself, as I said, never spoke at all. But our experience this\nsession led me to think, that if, by some such \"general understanding\"\nas the reports speak of in legislation daily, every member of Congress\nmight leave a double to sit through those deadly sessions and answer\nto roll-calls and do the legitimate party-voting, which appears\nstereotyped in the regular list of Ashe, Bocock, Black, etc., we\nshould gain decidedly in working power. As things stand, the saddest\nstate prison I ever visit is that Representatives' Chamber in\nWashington. If a man leaves for an hour, twenty \"correspondents\" may\nbe howling, \"Where was Mr. Prendergast when the Oregon bill passed?\"\nAnd if poor Prendergast stays there! Certainly, the worst use you can\nmake of a man is to put him in prison!\n\nI know, indeed, that public men of the highest rank have resorted to\nthis expedient long ago. Dumas's novel of _The Iron Mask_ turns on the\nbrutal imprisonment of Louis the Fourteenth's double. There seems\nlittle doubt, in our own history, that it was the real General Pierce\nwho shed tears when the delegate from Lawrence explained to him the\nsufferings of the people there--and only General Pierce's double who\nhad given the orders for the assault on that town, which was invaded\nthe next day. My charming friend, George Withers, has, I am almost\nsure, a double, who preaches his afternoon sermons for him. This is\nthe reason that the theology often varies so from that of the\nforenoon. But that double is almost as charming as the original. Some\nof the most well-defined men, who stand out most prominently on the\nbackground of history, are in this way stereoscopic men; who owe their\ndistinct relief to the slight differences between the doubles. All\nthis I know. My present suggestion is simply the great extension of\nthe system, so that all public machine-work may be done by it.\n\nBut I see I loiter on my story, which is rushing to the plunge. Let me\nstop an instant more, however, to recall, were it only to myself, that\ncharming year while all was yet well. After the double had become a\nmatter of course, for nearly twelve months before he undid me, what a\nyear it was! Full of active life, full of happy love, of the hardest\nwork, of the sweetest sleep, and the fulfilment of so many of the\nfresh aspirations and dreams of boyhood! Dennis went to every\nschool-committee meeting, and sat through all those late wranglings\nwhich used to keep me up till midnight and awake till morning. He\nattended all the lectures to which foreign exiles sent me tickets\nbegging me to come for the love of Heaven and of Bohemia. He accepted\nand used all the tickets for charity concerts which were sent to me.\nHe appeared everywhere where it was specially desirable that \"our\ndenomination,\" or \"our party,\" or \"our class,\" or \"our family,\" or\n\"our street,\" or \"our town,\" or \"our country,\" or \"our state,\" should\nbe fully represented. And I fell back to that charming life which in\nboyhood one dreams of, when he supposes he shall do his own duty and\nmake his own sacrifices, without being tied up with those of other\npeople. My rusty Sanskrit, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French,\nItalian, Spanish, German and English began to take polish. Heavens!\nhow little I had done with them while I attended to my _public_\nduties! My calls on my parishioners became the friendly, frequent,\nhomelike sociabilities they were meant to be, instead of the hard work\nof a man goaded to desperation by the sight of his lists of arrears.\nAnd preaching! what a luxury preaching was when I had on Sunday the\nwhole result of an individual, personal week, from which to speak to a\npeople whom all that week I had been meeting as hand-to-hand friend! I\nnever tired on Sunday, and was in condition to leave the sermon at\nhome, if I chose, and preach it extempore, as all men should do\nalways. Indeed, I wonder, when I think that a sensible people like\nours--really more attached to their clergy than they were in the lost\ndays, when the Mathers and Nortons were noblemen--should choose to\nneutralize so much of their ministers' lives, and destroy so much of\ntheir early training, by this undefined passion for seeing them in\npublic. It springs from our balancing of sects. If a spirited\nEpiscopalian takes an interest in the almshouse, and is put on the\nPoor Board, every other denomination must have a minister there, lest\nthe poorhouse be changed into St. Paul's Cathedral. If a Sandemanian\nis chosen president of the Young Men's Library, there must be a\nMethodist vice-president and a Baptist secretary. And if a\nUniversalist Sunday-School Convention collects five hundred delegates,\nthe next Congregationalist Sabbath-School Conference must be as large,\n\"lest 'they'--whoever _they_ may be--should think 'we'--whoever _we_\nmay be--are going down.\"\n\nFreed from these necessities, that happy year, I began to know my wife\nby sight. We saw each other sometimes. In those long mornings, when\nDennis was in the study explaining to map-peddlers that I had eleven\nmaps of Jerusalem already, and to school-book agents that I would see\nthem hanged before I would be bribed to introduce their textbooks into\nthe schools--she and I were at work together, as in those old dreamy\ndays--and in these of our log-cabin again. But all this could not\nlast--and at length poor Dennis, my double, overtasked in turn, undid\nme.\n\nIt was thus it happened. There is an excellent fellow--once a\nminister--I will call him Isaacs--who deserves well of the world till\nhe dies, and after--because he once, in a real exigency, did the right\nthing, in the right way, at the right time, as no other man could do\nit. In the world's great football match, the ball by chance found him\nloitering on the outside of the field; he closed with it, \"camped\" it,\ncharged, it home--yes, right through the other side--not disturbed,\nnot frightened by his own success--and breathless found himself a\ngreat man--as the Great Delta rang applause. But he did not find\nhimself a rich man; and the football has never come in his way again.\nFrom that moment to this moment he has been of no use, that one can\nsee, at all. Still, for that great act we speak of Isaacs gratefully\nand remember him kindly; and he forges on, hoping to meet the football\nsomewhere again. In that vague hope, he had arranged a \"movement\" for\na general organization of the human family into Debating Clubs, County\nSocieties, State Unions, etc., etc., with a view of inducing all\nchildren to take hold of the handles of their knives and forks,\ninstead of the metal. Children have bad habits in that way. The\nmovement, of course, was absurd; but we all did our best to forward,\nnot it, but him. It came time for the annual county-meeting on this\nsubject to be held at Naguadavick. Isaacs came round, good fellow! to\narrange for it--got the townhall, got the Governor to preside (the\nsaint!--he ought to have triplet doubles provided him by law), and\nthen came to get me to speak. \"No,\" I said, \"I would not speak, if ten\nGovernors presided. I do not believe in the enterprise. If I spoke, it\nshould be to say children should take hold of the prongs of the forks\nand the blades of the knives. I would subscribe ten dollars, but I\nwould not speak a mill.\" So poor Isaacs went his way, sadly, to coax\nAuchmuty to speak, and Delafield. I went out. Not long after, he came\nback, and told Polly that they had promised to speak--the Governor\nwould speak--and he himself would close with the quarterly report, and\nsome interesting anecdotes regarding. Miss Biffin's way of handling\nher knife and Mr. Nellis's way of footing his fork. \"Now if Mr. Ingham\nwill only come and sit on the platform, he need not say one word; but\nit will show well in the paper--it will show that the Sandemanians\ntake as much interest in the movement as the Armenians or the\nMesopotamians, and will be a great favor to me.\" Polly, good soul! was\ntempted, and she promised. She knew Mrs. Isaacs was starving, and the\nbabies--she knew Dennis was at home--and she promised! Night came, and\nI returned. I heard her story. I was sorry. I doubted. But Polly had\npromised to beg me, and I dared all! I told Dennis to hold his peace,\nunder all circumstances, and sent him down.\n\nIt was not half an hour more before he returned, wild with\nexcitement--in a perfect Irish fury--which it was long before I\nunderstood. But I knew at once that he had undone me!\n\nWhat happened was this: The audience got together, attracted by\nGovernor Gorges's name. There were a thousand people. Poor Gorges was\nlate from Augusta. They became impatient. He came in direct from the\ntrain at last, really ignorant of the object of the meeting. He opened\nit in the fewest possible words, and said other gentlemen were present\nwho would entertain them better than he. The audience were\ndisappointed, but waited. The Governor, prompted by Isaacs, said, \"The\nHonorable Mr. Delafield will address you.\" Delafield had forgotten the\nknives and forks, and was playing the Ruy Lopez opening at the chess\nclub. \"The Rev. Mr. Auchmuty will address you.\" Auchmuty had promised\nto speak late, and was at the school committee. \"I see Dr. Stearns in\nthe hall; perhaps he will say a word.\" Dr. Stearns said he had come to\nlisten and not to speak. The Governor and Isaacs whispered. The\nGovernor looked at Dennis, who was resplendent on the platform; but\nIsaacs, to give him his due, shook his head. But the look was enough.\nA miserable lad, ill-bred, who had once been in Boston, thought it\nwould sound well to call for me, and peeped out, \"Ingham!\" A few more\nwretches cried, \"Ingham! Ingham!\" Still Isaacs was firm; but the\nGovernor, anxious, indeed, to prevent a row, knew I would say\nsomething, and said, \"Our friend Mr. Ingham is always prepared--and\nthough we had not relied upon him, he will say a word, perhaps.\"\nApplause followed, which turned Dennis's head. He rose, flattered, and\ntried No. 3: \"There has been so much said, and, on the whole, so well\nsaid, that I will not longer occupy the time!\" and sat down, looking\nfor his hat; for things seemed squally. But the people cried, \"Go on!\ngo on!\" and some applauded. Dennis, still confused, but flattered by\nthe applause, to which neither he nor I are used, rose again, and this\ntime tried No. 2: \"I am very glad you liked it!\" in a sonorous, clear\ndelivery. My best friends stared. All the people who did not know me\npersonally yelled with delight at the aspect of the evening; the\nGovernor was beside himself, and poor Isaacs thought he was undone!\nAlas, it was I! A boy in the gallery cried in a loud tone, \"It's all\nan infernal humbug,\" just as Dennis, waving his hand, commanded\nsilence, and tried No. 4: \"I agree, in general, with my friend the\nother side of the room.\" The poor Governor doubted his senses, and\ncrossed to stop him--not in time, however. The same gallery-boy\nshouted, \"How's your mother?\"--and Dennis, now completely lost, tried,\nas his last shot, No. 1, vainly: \"Very well, thank you; and you?\"\n\nI think I must have been undone already. But Dennis, like another\nLockhard chose \"to make sicker.\" The audience rose in a whirl of\namazement, rage, and sorrow. Some other impertinence, aimed at Dennis,\nbroke all restraint, and, in pure Irish, he delivered himself of an\naddress to the gallery, inviting any person who wished to fight to\ncome down and do so--stating, that they were all dogs and\ncowards--that he would take any five of them single-handed, \"Shure, I\nhave said all his Riverence and the Misthress bade me say,\" cried he,\nin defiance; and, seizing the Governor's cane from his hand,\nbrandished it, quarter-staff fashion, above his head. He was, indeed,\ngot from the hall only with the greatest difficulty by the Governor,\nthe City Marshal, who had been called in, and the Superintendent of my\nSunday School.\n\nThe universal impression, of course, was, that the Rev. Frederic\nIngham had lost all command of himself in some of those haunts of\nintoxication which for fifteen years I have been laboring to destroy.\nTill this moment, indeed, that is the impression in Naguadavick. This\nnumber of _The Atlantic_ will relieve from it a hundred friends of\nmine who have been sadly wounded by that notion now for years--but I\nshall not be likely ever to show my head there again.\n\nNo! My double has undone me.\n\nWe left town at seven the next morning. I came to No. 9, in the Third\nRange, and settled on the Minister's Lot, In the new towns in Maine,\nthe first settled minister has a gift of a hundred acres of land. I am\nthe first settled minister in No. 9. My wife and little Paulina are my\nparish. We raise corn enough to live on in summer. We kill bear's meat\nenough to carbonize it in winter. I work on steadily on my _Traces of\nSandemanianism in the Sixth and Seventh Centuries_, which I hope to\npersuade Phillips, Sampson & Co. to publish next year. We are very\nhappy, but the world thinks we are undone.\n\n\n\nA VISIT TO THE ASYLUM FOR AGED AND DECAYED PUNSTERS\n\nBy Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894)\n\n[From _The Atlantic Monthly_, January, 1861. Republished in _Soundings\nfrom the Atlantic_ (1864), by Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose authorized\npublishers are the Houghton Mifflin Company.]\n\nHaving just returned from a visit to this admirable Institution in\ncompany with a friend who is one of the Directors, we propose giving a\nshort account of what we saw and heard. The great success of the\nAsylum for Idiots and Feeble-minded Youth, several of the scholars\nfrom which have reached considerable distinction, one of them being\nconnected with a leading Daily Paper in this city, and others having\nserved in the State and National Legislatures, was the motive which\nled to the foundation of this excellent charity. Our late\ndistinguished townsman, Noah Dow, Esquire, as is well known,\nbequeathed a large portion of his fortune to this establishment--\n\"being thereto moved,\" as his will expressed it, \"by the desire of\n_N. Dowing_ some public Institution for the benefit of Mankind.\"\nBeing consulted as to the Rules of the Institution and the selection\nof a Superintendent, he replied, that \"all Boards must construct\ntheir own Platforms of operation. Let them select _anyhow_ and he\nshould be pleased.\" N.E. Howe, Esq., was chosen in compliance with\nthis delicate suggestion.\n\nThe Charter provides for the support of \"One hundred aged and decayed\nGentlemen-Punsters.\" On inquiry if there way no provision for\n_females_, my friend called my attention to this remarkable\npsychological fact, namely:\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FEMALE PUNSTER.\n\nThis remark struck me forcibly, and on reflection I found that _I\nnever knew nor heard of one_, though I have once or twice heard a\nwoman make a _single detached_ pun, as I have known a hen to crow.\n\nOn arriving at the south gate of the Asylum grounds, I was about to\nring, but my friend held my arm and begged me to rap with my stick,\nwhich I did. An old man with a very comical face presently opened the\ngate and put out his head.\n\n\"So you prefer _Cane_ to _A bell_, do you?\" he said--and began\nchuckling and coughing at a great rate.\n\nMy friend winked at me.\n\n\"You're here still, Old Joe, I see,\" he said to the old man.\n\n\"Yes, yes--and it's very odd, considering how often I've _bolted_,\nnights.\"\n\nHe then threw open the double gates for us to ride through.\n\n\"Now,\" said the old man, as he pulled the gates after us, \"you've had\na long journey.\"\n\n\"Why, how is that, Old Joe?\" said my friend.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" he answered; \"there's the _East hinges_ on the one\nside of the gate, and there's the _West hinges_ on t'other side--haw!\nhaw! haw!\"\n\nWe had no sooner got into the yard than a feeble little gentleman,\nwith a remarkably bright eye, came up to us, looking very serious, as\nif something had happened.\n\n\"The town has entered a complaint against the Asylum as a gambling\nestablishment,\" he said to my friend, the Director.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said my friend.\n\n\"Why, they complain that there's a _lot o' rye_ on the premises,\" he\nanswered, pointing to a field of that grain--and hobbled away, his\nshoulders shaking with laughter, as he went.\n\nOn entering the main building, we saw the Rules and Regulations for\nthe Asylum conspicuously posted up. I made a few extracts which may be\ninteresting:\n\nSECT. I. OF VERBAL EXERCISES.\n\n5. Each Inmate shall be permitted to make Puns freely from eight in\nthe morning until ten at night, except during Service in the Chapel\nand Grace before Meals.\n\n6. At ten o'clock the gas will be turned off, and no further Puns,\nConundrums, or other play on words will be allowed to be uttered, or\nto be uttered aloud.\n\n9. Inmates who have lost their faculties and cannot any longer make\nPuns shall be permitted to repeat such as may be selected for them by\nthe Chaplain out of the work of _Mr. Joseph Miller_.\n\n10. Violent and unmanageable Punsters, who interrupt others when\nengaged in conversation, with Puns or attempts at the same, shall be\ndeprived of their _Joseph Millers_, and, if necessary, placed in\nsolitary confinement.\n\nSECT. III. OF DEPORTMENT AT MEALS.\n\n4. No Inmate shall make any Pun, or attempt at the same, until the\nBlessing has been asked and the company are decently seated.\n\n7. Certain Puns having been placed on the _Index Expurgatorius_ of the\nInstitution, no Inmate shall be allowed to utter them, on pain of\nbeing debarred the perusal of _Punch_ and _Vanity Fair_, and, if\nrepeated, deprived of his _Joseph Miller_.\n\nAmong these are the following:\n\nAllusions to _Attic salt_, when asked to pass the salt-cellar.\n\nRemarks on the Inmates being _mustered_, etc., etc.\n\nAssociating baked beans with the _bene_-factors of the Institution.\n\nSaying that beef-eating is _befitting_, etc., etc.\n\nThe following are also prohibited, excepting to such Inmates as may\nhave lost their faculties and cannot any longer make Puns of their\nown:\n\n\"----your own _hair_ or a wig\"; \"it will be _long enough_,\" etc.,\netc.; \"little of its age,\" etc., etc.; also, playing upon the\nfollowing words: _hos_pital; _mayor_; _pun_; _pitied_; _bread_;\n_sauce_, etc., etc., etc. _See_ INDEX EXPURGATORIUS, _printed for use\nof Inmates_.\n\nThe subjoined Conundrum is not allowed: Why is Hasty Pudding like the\nPrince? Because it comes attended by its _sweet_; nor this variation\nto it, _to wit_: Because the _'lasses runs after it_.\n\nThe Superintendent, who went round with us, had been a noted punster\nin his time, and well known in the business world, but lost his\ncustomers by making too free with their names--as in the famous story\nhe set afloat in '29 _of four Jerries_ attaching to the names of a\nnoted Judge, an eminent Lawyer, the Secretary of the Board of Foreign\nMissions, and the well-known Landlord at Springfield. One of the _four\nJerries_, he added, was of gigantic magnitude. The play on words was\nbrought out by an accidental remark of Solomons, the well-known\nBanker. \"_Capital punishment_!\" the Jew was overheard saying, with\nreference to the guilty parties. He was understood, as saying, _A\ncapital pun is meant_, which led to an investigation and the relief of\nthe greatly excited public mind.\n\nThe Superintendent showed some of his old tendencies, as he went round\nwith us.\n\n\"Do you know\"--he broke out all at once--\"why they don't take steppes\nin Tartary for establishing Insane Hospitals?\"\n\nWe both confessed ignorance.\n\n\"Because there are _nomad_ people to be found there,\" he said, with a\ndignified smile.\n\nHe proceeded to introduce us to different Inmates. The first was a\nmiddle-aged, scholarly man, who was seated at a table with a\n_Webster's Dictionary_ and a sheet of paper before him.\n\n\"Well, what luck to-day, Mr. Mowzer?\" said the Superintendent.\n\n\"Three or four only,\" said Mr. Mowzer. \"Will you hear 'em now--now I'm\nhere?\"\n\nWe all nodded.\n\n\"Don't you see Webster _ers_ in the words cent_er_ and theat_er_?\n\n\"If he spells leather _lether_, and feather _fether_, isn't there\ndanger that he'll give us a _bad spell of weather_?\n\n\"Besides, Webster is a resurrectionist; he does not allow _u_ to rest\nquietly in the _mould_.\n\n\"And again, because Mr. Worcester inserts an illustration in his text,\nis that any reason why Mr. Webster's publishers should hitch one on in\ntheir appendix? It's what I call a _Connect-a-cut_ trick.\n\n\"Why is his way of spelling like the floor of an oven? Because it is\n_under bread_.\"\n\n\"Mowzer!\" said the Superintendent, \"that word is on the Index!\"\n\n\"I forgot,\" said Mr. Mowzer; \"please don't deprive me of _Vanity Fair_\nthis one time, sir.\"\n\n\"These are all, this morning. Good day, gentlemen.\" Then to the\nSuperintendent: \"Add you, sir!\"\n\nThe next Inmate was a semi-idiotic-looking old man. He had a heap of\nblock-letters before him, and, as we came up, he pointed, without\nsaying a word, to the arrangements he had made with them on the table.\nThey were evidently anagrams, and had the merit of transposing the\nletters of the words employed without addition or subtraction. Here\nare a few of them:\n\n    TIMES.          SMITE!\n    POST.           STOP!\n\n    TRIBUNE.        TRUE NIB.\n    WORLD.          DR. OWL.\n\n    ADVERTISER.  {  RES VERI DAT.\n                 {  IS TRUE. READ!\n\n    ALLOPATHY.      ALL O' TH' PAY.\n    HOMOEOPATHY.    O, THE ----! O! O, MY! PAH!\n\nThe mention of several New York papers led to two or three questions.\nThus: Whether the Editor of _The Tribune_ was _H.G. really_? If the\ncomplexion of his politics were not accounted for by his being _an\neager_ person himself? Whether Wendell _Fillips_ were not a reduced\ncopy of John _Knocks_? Whether a New York _Feuilletoniste_ is not the\nsame thing as a _Fellow down East_?\n\nAt this time a plausible-looking, bald-headed man joined us, evidently\nwaiting to take a part in the conversation.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Riggles,\" said the Superintendent, \"Anything fresh\nthis morning? Any Conundrum?\"\n\n\"I haven't looked at the cattle,\" he answered, dryly.\n\n\"Cattle? Why cattle?\"\n\n\"Why, to see if there's any _corn under 'em_!\" he said; and\nimmediately asked, \"Why is Douglas like the earth?\"\n\nWe tried, but couldn't guess.\n\n\"Because he was _flattened out at the polls_!\" said Mr. Riggles.\n\n\"A famous politician, formerly,\" said the Superintendent. \"His\ngrandfather was a _seize-Hessian-ist_ in the Revolutionary War. By the\nway, I hear the _freeze-oil_ doctrines don't go down at New Bedford.\"\n\nThe next Inmate looked as if he might have been a sailor formerly.\n\n\"Ask him what his calling was,\" said the Superintendent.\n\n\"Followed the sea,\" he replied to the question put by one of us. \"Went\nas mate in a fishing-schooner.\"\n\n\"Why did you give it up?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't like working for _two mast-ers_,\" he replied.\n\nPresently we came upon a group of elderly persons, gathered about a\nvenerable gentleman with flowing locks, who was propounding questions\nto a row of Inmates.\n\n\"Can any Inmate give me a motto for M. Berger?\" he said.\n\nNobody responded for two or three minutes. At last one old man, whom I\nat once recognized as a Graduate of our University (Anno 1800) held up\nhis hand.\n\n\"Rem _a cue_ tetigit.\"\n\n\"Go to the head of the class, Josselyn,\" said the venerable patriarch.\n\nThe successful Inmate did as he was told, but in a very rough way,\npushing against two or three of the Class.\n\n\"How is this?\" said the Patriarch.\n\n\"You told me to go up _jostlin'_,\" he replied.\n\nThe old gentlemen who had been shoved about enjoyed the pun too much\nto be angry.\n\nPresently the Patriarch asked again:\n\n\"Why was M. Berger authorized to go to the dances given to the\nPrince?\"\n\nThe Class had to give up this, and he answered it himself:\n\n\"Because every one of his carroms was a _tick-it_ to the ball.\"\n\n\"Who collects the money to defray the expenses of the last campaign in\nItaly?\" asked the Patriarch.\n\nHere again the Class failed.\n\n\"The war-cloud's rolling _Dun_,\" he answered.\n\n\"And what is mulled wine made with?\"\n\nThree or four voices exclaimed at once:\n\n\"_Sizzle-y_ Madeira!\"\n\nHere a servant entered, and said, \"Luncheon-time.\" The old gentlemen,\nwho have excellent appetites, dispersed at once, one of them politely\nasking us if we would not stop and have a bit of bread and a little\nmite of cheese.\n\n\"There is one thing I have forgotten to show you,\" said the\nSuperintendent, \"the cell for the confinement of violent and\nunmanageable Punsters.\"\n\nWe were very curious to see it, particularly with reference to the\nalleged absence of every object upon which a play of words could\npossibly be made.\n\nThe Superintendent led us up some dark stairs to a corridor, then\nalong a narrow passage, then down a broad flight of steps into another\npassageway, and opened a large door which looked out on the main\nentrance.\n\n\"We have not seen the cell for the confinement of 'violent and\nunmanageable' Punsters,\" we both exclaimed.\n\n\"This is the _sell_!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the outside prospect.\n\nMy friend, the Director, looked me in the face so good-naturedly that\nI had to laugh.\n\n\"We like to humor the Inmates,\" he said. \"It has a bad effect, we\nfind, on their health and spirits to disappoint them of their little\npleasantries. Some of the jests to which we have listened are not new\nto me, though I dare say you may not have heard them often before. The\nsame thing happens in general society, with this additional\ndisadvantage, that there is no punishment provided for 'violent and\nunmanageable' Punsters, as in our Institution.\"\n\nWe made our bow to the Superintendent and walked to the place where\nour carriage was waiting for us. On our way, an exceedingly decrepit\nold man moved slowly toward us, with a perfectly blank look on his\nface, but still appearing as if he wished to speak.\n\n\"Look!\" said the Director--\"that is our Centenarian.\"\n\nThe ancient man crawled toward us, cocked one eye, with which he\nseemed to see a little, up at us, and said:\n\n\"Sarvant, young Gentlemen.

Republished in _The\nCelebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches_\n(1867), by Mark Twain, all of whose works are published by Harper &\nBrothers.]\n\nIn compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from\nthe East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and\ninquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to\ndo, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that\n_Leonidas W_. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a\npersonage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler\nabout him, it would remind him of his infamous _Jim Smiley_, and he\nwould go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating\nreminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to\nme. If that was the design, it succeeded.\n\nI found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the\ndilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and I\nnoticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of\nwinning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He\nroused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissioned\nme to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood\nnamed _Leonidas W_. Smiley--_Rev. Leonidas W._ Smiley, a young\nminister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident of\nAngel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about\nthis Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to\nhim.\n\nSimon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his\nchair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which\nfollows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he never\nchanged his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned his\ninitial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of\nenthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a\nvein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly\nthat, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or\nfunny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter,\nand admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in _finesse_.\nI let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.\n\n\"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here once\nby the name of _Jim_ Smiley, in the winter of '49--or may be it was\nthe spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what\nmakes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big\nflume warn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, he\nwas the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up\nyou ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if\nhe couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would\nsuit _him_--any way just so's he got a bet, _he_ was satisfied. But\nstill he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He\nwas always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no\nsolit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and\ntake any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a\nhorse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end\nof it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a\ncat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on\nit; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you\nwhich one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be\nthere reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best\nexhorter about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see a\nstraddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would\ntake him to get to--to wherever he _was_ going to, and if you took him\nup, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find\nout where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of\nthe boys here has seen that Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, it\nnever made no difference to _him_--he'd bet on _any_ thing--the\ndangest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good\nwhile, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one\nmorning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he\nsaid she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nit'\nmercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence\nshe'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll\nrisk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'\"\n\nThish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute\nnag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she was\nfaster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she\nwas so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the\nconsumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or\nthree hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always at\nthe fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate-like, and come\ncavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,\nsometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the\nfences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with\nher coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at\nthe stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it\ndown.\n\nAnd he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he\nwarn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a\nchance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a\ndifferent dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'-castle\nof a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the\nfurnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him,\nand throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew\nJackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let\non but what _he_ was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and\nthe bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time,\ntill the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that\nother dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not\nchaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed\nup the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that\npup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs,\nbecause they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing\nhad gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to\nmake a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been\nimposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak,\nand he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like,\nand didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out\nbad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and\nit was _his_ fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for\nhim to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and\nthen he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup,\nwas that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if\nhe'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it,\nbecause he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to\nreason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them\ncircumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry\nwhen I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.\n\nWell, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and\ntom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and\nyou couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He\nketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to\neducate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in\nhis back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he _did_\nlearn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next\nminute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see\nhim turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start,\nand come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so\nin the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant,\nthat he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley\nsaid all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most\nanything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down\nhere on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing\nout, \"Flies, Dan'l, flies!\" and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring\nstraight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on\nthe floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the\nside of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no\nidea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a\nfrog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so\ngifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level,\nhe could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his\nbreed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you\nunderstand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on\nhim as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog,\nand well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been\neverywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever _they_ see.\n\nWell, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to\nfetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller--a\nstranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:\n\n\"What might be that you've got in the box?\"\n\nAnd Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, \"It might be a parrot, or it\nmight be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.\"\n\nAnd the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round\nthis way and that, and says, \"H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's _he_ good\nfor?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Smiley says, easy and careless, \"he's good enough for _one_\nthing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county.\"\n\nThe feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,\nand give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, \"Well,\" he\nsays, \"I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any\nother frog.\"\n\n\"Maybe you don't,\" Smiley says. \"Maybe you understand frogs and maybe\nyou don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you\nain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got _my_ opinion and\nI'll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras\nCounty.\"\n\nAnd the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,\n\"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had\na frog, I'd bet you.\"\n\nAnd then Smiley says, \"That's all right--that's all right--if you'll\nhold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.\" And so the feller\ntook the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and\nset down to wait.\n\nSo he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, and\nthen he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon\nand filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to his\nchin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and\nslopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a\nfrog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:\n\n\"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his forepaws\njust even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.\" Then he says,\n\"One--two--three--_git_!\" and him and the feller touched up the frogs\nfrom behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give a\nheave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it\nwarn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church,\nand he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a\ngood deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no\nidea what the matter was, of course.\n\nThe feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out\nat the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at\nDan'l, and says again, very deliberate, \"Well,\" he says, \"_I_ don't\nsee no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.\"\n\nSmiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long\ntime, and at last says, \"I do wonder what in the nation that frog\nthrowed off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with\nhim--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.\" And he ketched Dan'l up\nby the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, \"Why blame my cats\nif he don't weigh five pounds!\" and turned him upside down and he\nbelched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and\nhe was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that\nfeller, but he never ketched him. And----\n\n(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got\nup to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, he\nsaid: \"Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going\nto be gone a second.\"\n\nBut, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history\nof the enterprising vagabond _Jim_ Smiley would be likely to afford me\nmuch information concerning the Rev. _Leonidas W._ Smiley, and so I\nstarted away.\n\nAt the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed\nme and recommenced:\n\n\"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn't have no\ntail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----\"\n\nHowever, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear\nabout the afflicted cow, but took my leave.\n\n\n\nELDER BROWN'S BACKSLIDE\n\nBy Harry Stillwell Edwards (1855- )\n\n[From _Harper's Magazine_, August, 1885; copyright, 1885, by Harper &\nBros.; republished in the volume, _Two Runaways, and Other Stories_\n(1889), by Harry Stillwell Edwards (The Century Co.).]\n\nElder Brown told his wife good-by at the farmhouse door as\nmechanically as though his proposed trip to Macon, ten miles away, was\nan everyday affair, while, as a matter of fact, many years had elapsed\nsince unaccompanied he set foot in the city. He did not kiss her. Many\nvery good men never kiss their wives. But small blame attaches to the\nelder for his omission on this occasion, since his wife had long ago\ndiscouraged all amorous demonstrations on the part of her liege lord,\nand at this particular moment was filling the parting moments with a\nrattling list of directions concerning thread, buttons, hooks,\nneedles, and all the many etceteras of an industrious housewife's\nbasket. The elder was laboriously assorting these postscript\ncommissions in his memory, well knowing that to return with any one of\nthem neglected would cause trouble in the family circle.\n\nElder Brown mounted his patient steed that stood sleepily motionless\nin the warm sunlight, with his great pointed ears displayed to the\nright and left, as though their owner had grown tired of the life\nburden their weight inflicted upon him, and was, old soldier fashion,\nready to forego the once rigid alertness of early training for the\npleasures of frequent rest on arms.\n\n\"And, elder, don't you forgit them caliker scraps, or you'll be\nwantin' kiver soon an' no kiver will be a-comin'.\"\n\nElder Brown did not turn his head, but merely let the whip hand, which\nhad been checked in its backward motion, fall as he answered\nmechanically. The beast he bestrode responded with a rapid whisking of\nits tail and a great show of effort, as it ambled off down the sandy\nroad, the rider's long legs seeming now and then to touch the ground.\n\nBut as the zigzag panels of the rail fence crept behind him, and he\nfelt the freedom of the morning beginning to act upon his well-trained\nblood, the mechanical manner of the old man's mind gave place to a\nmild exuberance. A weight seemed to be lifting from it ounce by ounce\nas the fence panels, the weedy corners, the persimmon sprouts and\nsassafras bushes crept away behind him, so that by the time a mile lay\nbetween him and the life partner of his joys and sorrows he was in a\nreasonably contented frame of mind, and still improving.\n\nIt was a queer figure that crept along the road that cheery May\nmorning. It was tall and gaunt, and had been for thirty years or more.\nThe long head, bald on top, covered behind with iron-gray hair, and in\nfront with a short tangled growth that curled and kinked in every\ndirection, was surmounted by an old-fashioned stove-pipe hat, worn and\nstained, but eminently impressive. An old-fashioned Henry Clay cloth\ncoat, stained and threadbare, divided itself impartially over the\ndonkey's back and dangled on his sides. This was all that remained of\nthe elder's wedding suit of forty years ago. Only constant care, and\nuse of late years limited to extra occasions, had preserved it so\nlong. The trousers had soon parted company with their friends. The\nsubstitutes were red jeans, which, while they did not well match his\ncourt costume, were better able to withstand the old man's abuse, for\nif, in addition to his frequent religious excursions astride his\nbeast, there ever was a man who was fond of sitting down with his feet\nhigher than his head, it was this selfsame Elder Brown.\n\nThe morning expanded, and the old man expanded with it; for while a\nvigorous leader in his church, the elder at home was, it must be\nadmitted, an uncomplaining slave. To the intense astonishment of the\nbeast he rode, there came new vigor into the whacks which fell upon\nhis flanks; and the beast allowed astonishment to surprise him into\nreal life and decided motion. Somewhere in the elder's expanding soul\na tune had begun to ring. Possibly he took up the far, faint tune that\ncame from the straggling gang of negroes away off in the field, as\nthey slowly chopped amid the threadlike rows of cotton plants which\nlined the level ground, for the melody he hummed softly and then sang\nstrongly, in the quavering, catchy tones of a good old country\nchurchman, was \"I'm glad salvation's free.\"\n\nIt was during the singing of this hymn that Elder Brown's regular\nmotion-inspiring strokes were for the first time varied. He began to\nhold his hickory up at certain pauses in the melody, and beat the\nchanges upon the sides of his astonished steed. The chorus under this\narrangement was:\n\n  I'm _glad_ salvation's _free_,\n  I'm _glad_ salvation's _free_,\n  I'm _glad_ salvation's _free_ for _all_,\n  I'm _glad_ salvation's _free_.\n\nWherever there is an italic, the hickory descended. It fell about as\nregularly and after the fashion of the stick beating upon the bass\ndrum during a funeral march. But the beast, although convinced that\nsomething serious was impending, did not consider a funeral march\nappropriate for the occasion. He protested, at first, with vigorous\nwhiskings of his tail and a rapid shifting of his ears. Finding these\ndemonstrations unavailing, and convinced that some urgent cause for\nhurry had suddenly invaded the elder's serenity, as it had his own, he\nbegan to cover the ground with frantic leaps that would have surprised\nhis owner could he have realized what was going on. But Elder Brown's\neyes were half closed, and he was singing at the top of his voice.\nLost in a trance of divine exaltation, for he felt the effects of the\ninvigorating motion, bent only on making the air ring with the lines\nwhich he dimly imagined were drawing upon him the eyes of the whole\nfemale congregation, he was supremely unconscious that his beast was\nhurrying.\n\nAnd thus the excursion proceeded, until suddenly a shote, surprised in\nhis calm search for roots in a fence corner, darted into the road, and\nstood for an instant gazing upon the newcomers with that idiotic stare\nwhich only a pig can imitate. The sudden appearance of this\nunlooked-for apparition acted strongly upon the donkey. With one\nsupreme effort he collected himself into a motionless mass of matter,\nbracing his front legs wide apart; that is to say, he stopped short.\nThere he stood, returning the pig's idiotic stare with an interest\nwhich must have led to the presumption that never before in all his\nvaried life had he seen such a singular little creature. End over end\nwent the man of prayer, finally bringing up full length in the sand,\nstriking just as he should have shouted \"free\" for the fourth time in\nhis glorious chorus.\n\nFully convinced that his alarm had been well founded, the shote sped\nout from under the gigantic missile hurled at him by the donkey, and\nscampered down the road, turning first one ear and then the other to\ndetect any sounds of pursuit. The donkey, also convinced that the\nobject before which he had halted was supernatural, started back\nviolently upon seeing it apparently turn to a man. But seeing that it\nhad turned to nothing but a man, he wandered up into the deserted\nfence corner, and began to nibble refreshment from a scrub oak.\n\nFor a moment the elder gazed up into the sky, half impressed with the\nidea that the camp-meeting platform had given way. But the truth\nforced its way to the front in his disordered understanding at last,\nand with painful dignity he staggered into an upright position, and\nregained his beaver. He was shocked again. Never before in all the\nlong years it had served him had he seen it in such shape. The truth\nis, Elder Brown had never before tried to stand on his head in it. As\ncalmly as possible he began to straighten it out, caring but little\nfor the dust upon his garments. The beaver was his special crown of\ndignity. To lose it was to be reduced to a level with the common\nwoolhat herd. He did his best, pulling, pressing, and pushing, but the\nhat did not look natural when he had finished. It seemed to have been\nlaid off into counties, sections, and town lots. Like a well-cut\njewel, it had a face for him, view it from whatever point he chose, a\nquality which so impressed him that a lump gathered in his throat, and\nhis eyes winked vigorously.\n\nElder Brown was not, however, a man for tears. He was a man of action.\nThe sudden vision which met his wandering gaze, the donkey calmly\nchewing scrub buds, with the green juice already oozing from the\ncorners of his frothy mouth, acted upon him like magic. He was, after\nall, only human, and when he got hands upon a piece of brush he\nthrashed the poor beast until it seemed as though even its already\nhalf-tanned hide would be eternally ruined. Thoroughly exhausted at\nlast, he wearily straddled his saddle, and with his chin upon his\nbreast resumed the early morning tenor of his way.\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"Good-mornin', sir.\"\n\nElder Brown leaned over the little pine picket which divided the\nbookkeepers' department of a Macon warehouse from the room in general,\nand surveyed the well-dressed back of a gentleman who was busily\nfiguring at a desk within. The apartment was carpetless, and the dust\nof a decade lay deep on the old books, shelves, and the familiar\nadvertisements of guano and fertilizers which decorated the room. An\nold stove, rusty with the nicotine contributed by farmers during the\nprevious season while waiting by its glowing sides for their cotton to\nbe sold, stood straight up in a bed of sand, and festoons of cobwebs\nclung to the upper sashes of the murky windows. The lower sash of one\nwindow had been raised, and in the yard without, nearly an acre in\nextent, lay a few bales of cotton, with jagged holes in their ends,\njust as the sampler had left them. Elder Brown had time to notice all\nthese familiar points, for the figure at the desk kept serenely at its\ntask, and deigned no reply.\n\n\"Good-mornin', sir,\" said Elder Brown again, in his most dignified\ntones. \"Is Mr. Thomas in?\"\n\n\"Good-morning, sir,\" said the figure. \"I'll wait on you in a minute.\"\nThe minute passed, and four more joined it. Then the desk man turned.\n\n\"Well, sir, what can I do for you?\"\n\nThe elder was not in the best of humor when he arrived, and his state\nof mind had not improved. He waited full a minute as he surveyed the\nman of business.\n\n\"I thought I mout be able to make some arrangements with you to git\nsome money, but I reckon I was mistaken.\" The warehouse man came\nnearer.\n\n\"This is Mr. Brown, I believe. I did not recognize you at once. You\nare not in often to see us.\"\n\n\"No; my wife usually 'tends to the town bizness, while I run the\nchurch and farm. Got a fall from my donkey this morning,\" he said,\nnoticing a quizzical, interrogating look upon the face before him,\n\"and fell squar' on the hat.\" He made a pretense of smoothing it. The\nman of business had already lost interest.\n\n\"How much money will you want, Mr. Brown?\"\n\n\"Well, about seven hundred dollars,\" said the elder, replacing his\nhat, and turning a furtive look upon the warehouse man. The other was\ntapping with his pencil upon the little shelf lying across the rail.\n\n\"I can get you five hundred.\"\n\n\"But I oughter have seven.\"\n\n\"Can't arrange for that amount. Wait till later in the season, and\ncome again. Money is very tight now. How much cotton will you raise?\"\n\n\"Well, I count on a hundr'd bales. An' you can't git the sev'n hundr'd\ndollars?\"\n\n\"Like to oblige you, but can't right now; will fix it for you later\non.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the elder, slowly, \"fix up the papers for five, an' I'll\nmake it go as far as possible.\"\n\nThe papers were drawn. A note was made out for $552.50, for the\ninterest was at one and a half per cent. for seven months, and a\nmortgage on ten mules belonging to the elder was drawn and signed. The\nelder then promised to send his cotton to the warehouse to be sold in\nthe fall, and with a curt \"Anything else?\" and a \"Thankee, that's\nall,\" the two parted.\n\nElder Brown now made an effort to recall the supplemental commissions\nshouted to him upon his departure, intending to execute them first,\nand then take his written list item by item. His mental resolves had\njust reached this point when a new thought made itself known.\nPassersby were puzzled to see the old man suddenly snatch his\nheadpiece off and peer with an intent and awestruck air into its\nirregular caverns. Some of them were shocked when he suddenly and\nvigorously ejaculated:\n\n\"Hannah-Maria-Jemimy! goldarn an' blue blazes!\"\n\nHe had suddenly remembered having placed his memoranda in that hat,\nand as he studied its empty depths his mind pictured the important\nscrap fluttering along the sandy scene of his early-morning tumble. It\nwas this that caused him to graze an oath with less margin that he had\nallowed himself in twenty years. What would the old lady say?\n\nAlas! Elder Brown knew too well. What she would not say was what\npuzzled him. But as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight a sense of\nutter desolation came and dwelt with him. His eye rested upon sleeping\nBalaam anchored to a post in the street, and so as he recalled the\ntreachery that lay at the base of all his affliction, gloom was added\nto the desolation.\n\nTo turn back and search for the lost paper would have been worse than\nuseless. Only one course was open to him, and at it went the leader of\nhis people. He called at the grocery; he invaded the recesses of the\ndry-goods establishments; he ransacked the hardware stores; and\nwherever he went he made life a burden for the clerks, overhauling\nshow-cases and pulling down whole shelves of stock. Occasionally an\nitem of his memoranda would come to light, and thrusting his hand into\nhis capacious pocket, where lay the proceeds of his check, he would\npay for it upon the spot, and insist upon having it rolled up. To the\nsuggestion of the slave whom he had in charge for the time being that\nthe articles be laid aside until he had finished, he would not listen.\n\n\"Now you look here, sonny,\" he said, in the dry-goods store, \"I'm\nconducting this revival, an' I don't need no help in my line. Just you\ntie them stockin's up an' lemme have 'em. Then I _know_ I've _got_\n'em.\" As each purchase was promptly paid for, and change had to be\nsecured, the clerk earned his salary for that day at least.\n\nSo it was when, near the heat of the day, the good man arrived at the\ndrugstore, the last and only unvisited division of trade, he made his\nappearance equipped with half a hundred packages, which nestled in his\narms and bulged out about the sections of his clothing that boasted of\npockets. As he deposited his deck-load upon the counter, great drops\nof perspiration rolled down his face and over his waterlogged collar\nto the floor.\n\nThere was something exquisitely refreshing in the great glasses of\nfoaming soda that a spruce young man was drawing from a marble\nfountain, above which half a dozen polar bears in an ambitious print\nwere disporting themselves. There came a break in the run of\ncustomers, and the spruce young man, having swept the foam from the\nmarble, dexterously lifted a glass from the revolving rack which had\nrinsed it with a fierce little stream of water, and asked\nmechanically, as he caught the intense look of the perspiring elder,\n\"What syrup, sir?\"\n\nNow it had not occurred to the elder to drink soda, but the\nsuggestion, coming as it did in his exhausted state, was overpowering.\nHe drew near awkwardly, put on his glasses, and examined the list of\nsyrups with great care. The young man, being for the moment at\nleisure, surveyed critically the gaunt figure, the faded bandanna, the\nantique clawhammer coat, and the battered stove-pipe hat, with a\ngradually relaxing countenance. He even called the prescription\nclerk's attention by a cough and a quick jerk of the thumb. The\nprescription clerk smiled freely, and continued his assaults upon a\npiece of blue mass.\n\n\"I reckon,\" said the elder, resting his hands upon his knees and\nbending down to the list, \"you may gimme sassprilla an' a little\nstrawberry. Sassprilla's good for the blood this time er year, an'\nstrawberry's good any time.\"\n\nThe spruce young man let the syrup stream into the glass as he smiled\naffably. Thinking, perhaps, to draw out the odd character, he ventured\nupon a jest himself, repeating a pun invented by the man who made the\nfirst soda fountain. With a sweep of his arm he cleared away the swarm\nof insects as he remarked, \"People who like a fly in theirs are easily\naccommodated.\"\n\nIt was from sheer good-nature only that Elder Brown replied, with his\nusual broad, social smile, \"Well, a fly now an' then don't hurt\nnobody.\"\n\nNow if there is anybody in the world who prides himself on knowing a\nthing or two, it is the spruce young man who presides over a soda\nfountain. This particular young gentleman did not even deem a reply\nnecessary. He vanished an instant, and when he returned a close\nobserver might have seen that the mixture in the glass he bore had\nslightly changed color and increased in quantity. But the elder saw\nonly the whizzing stream of water dart into its center, and the rosy\nfoam rise and tremble on the glass's rim. The next instant he was\nholding his breath and sipping the cooling drink.\n\nAs Elder Brown paid his small score he was at peace with the world. I\nfirmly believe that when he had finished his trading, and the little\nblue-stringed packages had been stored away, could the poor donkey\nhave made his appearance at the door, and gazed with his meek,\nfawnlike eyes into his master's, he would have obtained full and free\nforgiveness.\n\nElder Brown paused at the door as he was about to leave. A\nrosy-cheeked school-girl was just lifting a creamy mixture to her lips\nbefore the fountain. It was a pretty picture, and he turned back,\nresolved to indulge in one more glass of the delightful beverage\nbefore beginning his long ride homeward.\n\n\"Fix it up again, sonny,\" he said, renewing his broad, confiding\nsmile, as the spruce young man poised a glass inquiringly. The living\nautomaton went through the same motions as before, and again Elder\nBrown quaffed the fatal mixture.\n\nWhat a singular power is habit! Up to this time Elder Brown had been\nentirely innocent of transgression, but with the old alcoholic fire in\nhis veins, twenty years dropped from his shoulders, and a feeling came\nover him familiar to every man who has been \"in his cups.\" As a matter\nof fact, the elder would have been a confirmed drunkard twenty years\nbefore had his wife been less strong-minded. She took the reins into\nher own hands when she found that his business and strong drink did\nnot mix well, worked him into the church, sustained his resolutions by\nmaking it difficult and dangerous for him to get to his toddy. She\nbecame the business head of the family, and he the spiritual. Only at\nrare intervals did he ever \"backslide\" during the twenty years of the\nnew era, and Mrs. Brown herself used to say that the \"sugar in his'n\nturned to gall before the backslide ended.\" People who knew her never\ndoubted it.\n\nBut Elder Brown's sin during the remainder of the day contained an\nelement of responsibility. As he moved majestically down toward where\nBalaam slept in the sunlight, he felt no fatigue. There was a glow\nupon his cheek-bones, and a faint tinge upon his prominent nose. He\nnodded familiarly to people as he met them, and saw not the look of\namusement which succeeded astonishment upon the various faces. When he\nreached the neighborhood of Balaam it suddenly occurred to him that he\nmight have forgotten some one of his numerous commissions, and he\npaused to think. Then a brilliant idea rose in his mind. He would\nforestall blame and disarm anger with kindness--he would purchase\nHannah a bonnet.\n\nWhat woman's heart ever failed to soften at sight of a new bonnet?\n\nAs I have stated, the elder was a man of action. He entered a store\nnear at hand.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said an affable gentleman with a Hebrew countenance,\napproaching.\n\n\"Good-mornin', good-mornin',\" said the elder, piling his bundles on\nthe counter. \"I hope you are well?\" Elder Brown extended his hand\nfervidly.\n\n\"Quite well, I thank you. What--\"\n\n\"And the little wife?\" said Elder Brown, affectionately retaining the\nJew's hand.\n\n\"Quite well, sir.\"\n\n\"And the little ones--quite well, I hope, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; all well, thank you. Something I can do for you?\"\n\nThe affable merchant was trying to recall his customer's name.\n\n\"Not now, not now, thankee. If you please to let my bundles stay\nuntell I come back--\"\n\n\"Can't I show you something? Hat, coat--\"\n\n\"Not now. Be back bimeby.\"\n\nWas it chance or fate that brought Elder Brown in front of a bar? The\nglasses shone bright upon the shelves as the swinging door flapped\nback to let out a coatless clerk, who passed him with a rush, chewing\nupon a farewell mouthful of brown bread and bologna. Elder Brown\nbeheld for an instant the familiar scene within. The screws of his\nresolution had been loosened. At sight of the glistening bar the whole\nmoral structure of twenty years came tumbling down. Mechanically he\nentered the saloon, and laid a silver quarter upon the bar as he said:\n\n\"A little whiskey an' sugar.\" The arms of the bartender worked like a\nfaker's in a side show as he set out the glass with its little quota\nof \"short sweetening\" and a cut-glass decanter, and sent a\nhalf-tumbler of water spinning along from the upper end of the bar\nwith a dime in change.\n\n\"Whiskey is higher'n used to be,\" said Elder Brown; but the bartender\nwas taking another order, and did not hear him. Elder Brown stirred\naway the sugar, and let a steady stream of red liquid flow into the\nglass. He swallowed the drink as unconcernedly as though his morning\ntod had never been suspended, and pocketed the change. \"But it ain't\nany better than it was,\" he concluded, as he passed out. He did not\neven seem to realize that he had done anything extraordinary.\n\nThere was a millinery store up the street, and thither with uncertain\nstep he wended his way, feeling a little more elate, and altogether\nsociable. A pretty, black-eyed girl, struggling to keep down her\nmirth, came forward and faced him behind the counter. Elder Brown\nlifted his faded hat with the politeness, if not the grace, of a\nCastilian, and made a sweeping bow. Again he was in his element. But\nhe did not speak. A shower of odds and ends, small packages, thread,\nneedles, and buttons, released from their prison, rattled down about\nhim.\n\nThe girl laughed. She could not help it. And the elder, leaning his\nhand on the counter, laughed, too, until several other girls came\nhalf-way to the front. Then they, hiding behind counters and suspended\ncloaks, laughed and snickered until they reconvulsed the elder's\nvis-a-vis, who had been making desperate efforts to resume her demure\nappearance.\n\n\"Let me help you, sir,\" she said, coming from behind the counter, upon\nseeing Elder Brown beginning to adjust his spectacles for a search. He\nwaved her back majestically. \"No, my dear, no; can't allow it. You\nmout sile them purty fingers. No, ma'am. No gen'l'man'll 'low er lady\nto do such a thing.\" The elder was gently forcing the girl back to her\nplace. \"Leave it to me. I've picked up bigger things 'n them. Picked\nmyself up this mornin'. Balaam--you don't know Balaam; he's my\ndonkey--he tumbled me over his head in the sand this mornin'.\" And\nElder Brown had to resume an upright position until his paroxysm of\nlaughter had passed. \"You see this old hat?\" extending it, half full\nof packages; \"I fell clear inter it; jes' as clean inter it as them\nthings thar fell out'n it.\" He laughed again, and so did the girls.\n\"But, my dear, I whaled half the hide off'n him for it.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir! how could you? Indeed, sir. I think you did wrong. The poor\nbrute did not know what he was doing, I dare say, and probably he has\nbeen a faithful friend.\" The girl cast her mischievous eyes towards\nher companions, who snickered again. The old man was not conscious of\nthe sarcasm. He only saw reproach. His face straightened, and he\nregarded the girl soberly.\n\n\"Mebbe you're right, my dear; mebbe I oughtn't.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said the girl. \"But now don't you want to buy a\nbonnet or a cloak to carry home to your wife?\"\n\n\"Well, you're whistlin' now, birdie; that's my intention; set 'em all\nout.\" Again the elder's face shone with delight. \"An' I don't want no\none-hoss bonnet neither.\"\n\n\"Of course not. Now here is one; pink silk, with delicate pale blue\nfeathers. Just the thing for the season. We have nothing more elegant\nin stock.\" Elder Brown held it out, upside down, at arm's-length.\n\n\"Well, now, that's suthin' like. Will it soot a sorter redheaded\n'ooman?\"\n\nA perfectly sober man would have said the girl's corsets must have\nundergone a terrible strain, but the elder did not notice her dumb\nconvulsion. She answered, heroically:\n\n\"Perfectly, sir. It is an exquisite match.\"\n\n\"I think you're whistlin' again. Nancy's head's red, red as a\nwoodpeck's. Sorrel's only half-way to the color of her top-knot, an'\nit do seem like red oughter to soot red. Nancy's red an' the hat's\nred; like goes with like, an' birds of a feather flock together.\" The\nold man laughed until his cheeks were wet.\n\nThe girl, beginning to feel a little uneasy, and seeing a customer\nentering, rapidly fixed up the bonnet, took fifteen dollars out of a\ntwenty-dollar bill, and calmly asked the elder if he wanted anything\nelse. He thrust his change somewhere into his clothes, and beat a\nretreat. It had occurred to him that he was nearly drunk.\n\nElder Brown's step began to lose its buoyancy. He found himself\nutterly unable to walk straight. There was an uncertain straddle in\nhis gait that carried him from one side of the walk to the other, and\ncaused people whom he met to cheerfully yield him plenty of room.\n\nBalaam saw him coming. Poor Balaam. He had made an early start that\nday, and for hours he stood in the sun awaiting relief. When he opened\nhis sleepy eyes and raised his expressive ears to a position of\nattention, the old familiar coat and battered hat of the elder were\nbefore him. He lifted up his honest voice and cried aloud for joy.\n\nThe effect was electrical for one instant. Elder Brown surveyed the\nbeast with horror, but again in his understanding there rang out the\ntrumpet words.\n\n\"Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, -er-unc, -unc, -unc.\"\n\nHe stooped instinctively for a missile with which to smite his\naccuser, but brought up suddenly with a jerk and a handful of sand.\nStraightening himself up with a majestic dignity, he extended his\nright hand impressively.\n\n\"You're a goldarn liar, Balaam, and, blast your old buttons, you kin\nwalk home by yourself, for I'm danged if you sh'll ride me er step.\"\n\nSurely Coriolanus never turned his back upon Rome with a grander\ndignity than sat upon the old man's form as he faced about and left\nthe brute to survey with anxious eyes the new departure of his master.\n\nHe saw the elder zigzag along the street, and beheld him about to turn\na friendly corner. Once more he lifted up his mighty voice:\n\n\"Drunk, drunk, drunk, drer-unc, drer-unc, -erunc, -unc, -unc.\"\n\nOnce more the elder turned with lifted hand and shouted back:\n\n\"You're a liar, Balaam, goldarn you! You're er iffamous liar.\" Then he\npassed from view.\n\n\nIII\n\nMrs. Brown stood upon the steps anxiously awaiting the return of her\nliege lord. She knew he had with him a large sum of money, or should\nhave, and she knew also that he was a man without business methods.\nShe had long since repented of the decision which sent him to town.\nWhen the old battered hat and flour-covered coat loomed up in the\ngloaming and confronted her, she stared with terror. The next instant\nshe had seized him.\n\n\"For the Lord sakes, Elder Brown, what ails you? As I live, if the man\nain't drunk! Elder Brown! Elder Brown! for the life of me can't I make\nyou hear? You crazy old hypocrite! you desavin' old sinner! you\nblack-hearted wretch! where have you ben?\"\n\nThe elder made an effort to wave her off.\n\n\"Woman,\" he said, with grand dignity, \"you forgit yus-sef; shu know\nware I've ben 'swell's I do. Ben to town, wife, an' see yer wat I've\nbrought--the fines' hat, ole woman, I could git. Look't the color.\nLike goes 'ith like; it's red an' you're red, an' it's a dead match.\nWhat yer mean? Hey! hole on! ole woman!--you! Hannah!--you.\" She\nliterally shook him into silence.\n\n\"You miserable wretch! you low-down drunken sot! what do you mean by\ncoming home and insulting your wife?\" Hannah ceased shaking him from\npure exhaustion.\n\n\"Where is it, I say? where is it?\"\n\nBy this time she was turning his pockets wrong side out. From one she\ngot pills, from another change, from another packages.\n\n\"The Lord be praised, and this is better luck than I hoped! Oh, elder!\nelder! elder! what did you do it for? Why, man, where is Balaam?\"\n\nThought of the beast choked off the threatened hysterics.\n\n\"Balaam? Balaam?\" said the elder, groggily. \"He's in town. The\ninfernal ole fool 'sulted me, an' I lef' him to walk home.\"\n\nHis wife surveyed him. Really at that moment she did think his mind\nwas gone; but the leer upon the old man's face enraged her beyond\nendurance.\n\n\"You did, did you? Well, now, I reckon you'll laugh for some cause,\nyou will. Back you go, sir--straight back; an' don't you come home\n'thout that donkey, or you'll rue it, sure as my name is Hannah Brown.\nAleck!--you Aleck-k-k!\"\n\nA black boy darted round the corner, from behind which, with several\nothers, he had beheld the brief but stirring scene.\n\n\"Put a saddle on er mule. The elder's gwine back to town. And don't\nyou be long about it neither.\"\n\n\"Yessum.\" Aleck's ivories gleamed in the darkness as he disappeared.\n\nElder Brown was soberer at that moment than he had been for hours.\n\n\"Hannah, you don't mean it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I do. Back you go to town as sure as my name is Hannah\nBrown.\"\n\nThe elder was silent. He had never known his wife to relent on any\noccasion after she had affirmed her intention, supplemented with \"as\nsure as my name is Hannah Brown.\" It was her way of swearing. No\naffidavit would have had half the claim upon her as that simple\nenunciation.\n\nSo back to town went Elder Brown, not in the order of the early morn,\nbut silently, moodily, despairingly, surrounded by mental and actual\ngloom.\n\nThe old man had turned a last appealing glance upon the angry woman,\nas he mounted with Aleck's assistance, and sat in the light that\nstreamed from out the kitchen window. She met the glance without a\nwaver.\n\n\"She means it, as sure as my name is Elder Brown,\" he said, thickly.\nThen he rode on.\n\nIV\n\nTo say that Elder Brown suffered on this long journey back to Macon\nwould only mildly outline his experience. His early morning's fall had\nbegun to make itself felt. He was sore and uncomfortable. Besides, his\nstomach was empty, and called for two meals it had missed for the\nfirst time in years.\n\nWhen, sore and weary, the elder entered the city, the electric lights\nshone above it like jewels in a crown. The city slept; that is, the\nbetter portion of it did. Here and there, however, the lower lights\nflashed out into the night. Moodily the elder pursued his journey, and\nas he rode, far off in the night there rose and quivered a plaintive\ncry. Elder Brown smiled wearily: it was Balaam's appeal, and he\nrecognized it. The animal he rode also recognized it, and replied,\nuntil the silence of the city was destroyed. The odd clamor and\nconfusion drew from a saloon near by a group of noisy youngsters, who\nhad been making a night of it. They surrounded Elder Brown as he began\nto transfer himself to the hungry beast to whose motion he was more\naccustomed, and in the \"hail fellow well met\" style of the day began\nto bandy jests upon his appearance. Now Elder Brown was not in a\njesting humor. Positively he was in the worst humor possible. The\nresult was that before many minutes passed the old man was swinging\nseveral of the crowd by their collars, and breaking the peace of the\ncity. A policeman approached, and but for the good-humored party, upon\nwhom the elder's pluck had made a favorable impression, would have run\nthe old man into the barracks. The crowd, however, drew him laughingly\ninto the saloon and to the bar. The reaction was too much for his\nhalf-rallied senses. He yielded again. The reviving liquor passed his\nlips. Gloom vanished. He became one of the boys.\n\nThe company into which Elder Brown had fallen was what is known as\n\"first-class.\" To such nothing is so captivating as an adventure out\nof the common run of accidents. The gaunt countryman, with his\nbattered hat and claw-hammer coat, was a prize of an extraordinary\nnature. They drew him into a rear room, whose gilded frames and\npolished tables betrayed the character and purpose of the place, and\nplied him with wine until ten thousand lights danced about him. The\nfun increased. One youngster made a political speech from the top of\nthe table; another impersonated Hamlet; and finally Elder Brown was\nlifted into a chair, and sang a camp-meeting song. This was rendered\nby him with startling effect. He stood upright, with his hat jauntily\nknocked to one side, and his coat tails ornamented with a couple of\nshow-bills, kindly pinned on by his admirers. In his left hand he\nwaved the stub of a cigar, and on his back was an admirable\nrepresentation of Balaam's head, executed by some artist with billiard\nchalk.\n\nAs the elder sang his favorite hymn, \"I'm glad salvation's free,\" his\nstentorian voice awoke the echoes. Most of the company rolled upon the\nfloor in convulsions of laughter.\n\nThe exhibition came to a close by the chair overturning. Again Elder\nBrown fell into his beloved hat. He arose and shouted: \"Whoa, Balaam!\"\nAgain he seized the nearest weapon, and sought satisfaction. The young\ngentleman with political sentiments was knocked under the table, and\nHamlet only escaped injury by beating the infuriated elder into the\nstreet.\n\nWhat next? Well, I hardly know. How the elder found Balaam is a\nmystery yet: not that Balaam was hard to find, but that the old man\nwas in no condition to find anything. Still he did, and climbing\nlaboriously into the saddle, he held on stupidly while the hungry\nbeast struck out for home.\n\nV\n\nHannah Brown did not sleep that night. Sleep would not come. Hour\nafter hour passed, and her wrath refused to be quelled. She tried\nevery conceivable method, but time hung heavily. It was not quite peep\nof day, however, when she laid her well-worn family Bible aside. It\nhad been her mother's, and amid all the anxieties and tribulations\nincident to the life of a woman who had free negroes and a miserable\nhusband to manage, it had been her mainstay and comfort. She had\nfrequently read it in anger, page after page, without knowing what was\ncontained in the lines. But eventually the words became intelligible\nand took meaning. She wrested consolation from it by mere force of\nwill.\n\nAnd so on this occasion when she closed the book the fierce anger was\ngone.\n\nShe was not a hard woman naturally. Fate had brought her conditions\nwhich covered up the woman heart within her, but though it lay deep,\nit was there still. As she sat with folded hands her eyes fell\nupon--what?\n\nThe pink bonnet with the blue plume!\n\nIt may appear strange to those who do not understand such natures, but\nto me her next action was perfectly natural. She burst into a\nconvulsive laugh; then, seizing the queer object, bent her face upon\nit and sobbed hysterically. When the storm was over, very tenderly she\nlaid the gift aside, and bare-headed passed out into the night.\n\nFor a half-hour she stood at the end of the lane, and then hungry\nBalaam and his master hove in sight. Reaching out her hand, she\nchecked the beast.\n\n\"William,\" said she, very gently, \"where is the mule?\"\n\nThe elder had been asleep. He woke and gazed upon her blankly.\n\n\"What mule, Hannah?\"\n\n\"The mule you rode to town.\"\n\nFor one full minute the elder studied her face. Then it burst from his\nlips:\n\n\"Well, bless me! if I didn't bring Balaam and forgit the mule!\"\n\nThe woman laughed till her eyes ran water.\n\n\"William,\" said she, \"you're drunk.\"\n\n\"Hannah,\" said he, meekly, \"I know it. The truth is, Hannah, I--\"\n\n\"Never mind, now, William,\" she said, gently. \"You are tired and\nhungry. Come into the house, husband.\"\n\nLeading Balaam, she disappeared down the lane; and when, a few minutes\nlater, Hannah Brown and her husband entered through the light that\nstreamed out of the open door her arms were around him, and her face\nupturned to his.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MR. PINK FLUKER\n\nBY RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON (1822-1898)\n\n[From _The Century Magazine_, June, 1886; copyright, 1886, by The\nCentury Co.; republished in the volume, _Mr. Absalom Billingslea, and\nOther Georgia Folk_ (1888), by Richard Malcolm Johnston (Harper &\nBrothers).]\n\nI\n\nMr. Peterson Fluker, generally called Pink, for his fondness for as\nstylish dressing as he could afford, was one of that sort of men who\nhabitually seem busy and efficient when they are not. He had the\nbustling activity often noticeable in men of his size, and in one way\nand another had made up, as he believed, for being so much smaller\nthan most of his adult acquaintance of the male sex. Prominent among\nhis achievements on that line was getting married to a woman who,\namong other excellent gifts, had that of being twice as big as her\nhusband.\n\n\"Fool who?\" on the day after his marriage he had asked, with a look at\nthose who had often said that he was too little to have a wife.\n\nThey had a little property to begin with, a couple of hundreds of\nacres, and two or three negroes apiece. Yet, except in the natural\nincrease of the latter, the accretions of worldly estate had been\ninconsiderable till now, when their oldest child, Marann, was some\nfifteen years old. These accretions had been saved and taken care of\nby Mrs. Fluker, who was as staid and silent as he was mobile and\nvoluble.\n\nMr. Fluker often said that it puzzled him how it was that he made\nsmaller crops than most of his neighbors, when, if not always\nconvincing, he could generally put every one of them to silence in\ndiscussions upon agricultural topics. This puzzle had led him to not\nunfrequent ruminations in his mind as to whether or not his vocation\nmight lie in something higher than the mere tilling of the ground.\nThese ruminations had lately taken a definite direction, and it was\nafter several conversations which he had held with his friend Matt\nPike.\n\nMr. Matt Pike was a bachelor of some thirty summers, a foretime clerk\nconsecutively in each of the two stores of the village, but latterly a\ntrader on a limited scale in horses, wagons, cows, and similar objects\nof commerce, and at all times a politician. His hopes of holding\noffice had been continually disappointed until Mr. John Sanks became\nsheriff, and rewarded with a deputyship some important special service\nrendered by him in the late very close canvass. Now was a chance to\nrise, Mr. Pike thought. All he wanted, he had often said, was a start.\nPolitics, I would remark, however, had been regarded by Mr. Pike as a\nmeans rather than an end. It is doubtful if he hoped to become\ngovernor of the state, at least before an advanced period in his\ncareer. His main object now was to get money, and he believed that\nofficial position would promote him in the line of his ambition faster\nthan was possible to any private station, by leading him into more\nextensive acquaintance with mankind, their needs, their desires, and\ntheir caprices. A deputy sheriff, provided that lawyers were not too\nindulgent in allowing acknowledgment of service of court processes, in\npostponing levies and sales, and in settlement of litigated cases,\nmight pick up three hundred dollars, a good sum for those times, a\nfact which Mr. Pike had known and pondered long.\n\nIt happened just about then that the arrears of rent for the village\nhotel had so accumulated on Mr. Spouter, the last occupant, that the\nowner, an indulgent man, finally had said, what he had been expected\nfor years and years to say, that he could not wait on Mr. Spouter\nforever and eternally. It was at this very nick, so to speak, that Mr.\nPike made to Mr. Fluker the suggestion to quit a business so far\nbeneath his powers, sell out, or rent out, or tenant out, or do\nsomething else with his farm, march into town, plant himself upon the\nruins of Jacob Spouter, and begin his upward soar.\n\nNow Mr. Fluker had many and many a time acknowledged that he had\nambition; so one night he said to his wife:\n\n\"You see how it is here, Nervy. Farmin' somehow don't suit my talons.\nI need to be flung more 'mong people to fetch out what's in me. Then\nthar's Marann, which is gittin' to be nigh on to a growd-up woman; an'\nthe child need the s'iety which you 'bleeged to acknowledge is sca'ce\nabout here, six mile from town. Your brer Sam can stay here an' raise\nbutter, chickens, eggs, pigs, an'--an'--an' so forth. Matt Pike say he\njes' know they's money in it, an' special with a housekeeper keerful\nan' equinomical like you.\"\n\nIt is always curious the extent of influence that some men have upon\nwives who are their superiors. Mrs. Fluker, in spite of accidents, had\never set upon her husband a value that was not recognized outside of\nhis family. In this respect there seems a surprising compensation in\nhuman life. But this remark I make only in passing. Mrs. Fluker,\nadmitting in her heart that farming was not her husband's forte,\nhoped, like a true wife, that it might be found in the new field to\nwhich he aspired. Besides, she did not forget that her brother Sam had\nsaid to her several times privately that if his brer Pink wouldn't\nhave so many notions and would let him alone in his management, they\nwould all do better. She reflected for a day or two, and then said:\n\n\"Maybe it's best, Mr. Fluker. I'm willin' to try it for a year,\nanyhow. We can't lose much by that. As for Matt Pike, I hain't the\nconfidence in him you has. Still, he bein' a boarder and deputy\nsheriff, he might accidentally do us some good. I'll try it for a year\nprovidin' you'll fetch me the money as it's paid in, for you know I\nknow how to manage that better'n you do, and you know I'll try to\nmanage it and all the rest of the business for the best.\"\n\nTo this provision Mr. Fluker gave consent, qualified by the claim that\nhe was to retain a small margin for indispensable personal exigencies.\nFor he contended, perhaps with justice, that no man in the responsible\nposition he was about to take ought to be expected to go about, or sit\nabout, or even lounge about, without even a continental red in his\npocket.\n\nThe new house--I say _new_ because tongue could not tell the amount of\nscouring, scalding, and whitewashing that that excellent housekeeper\nhad done before a single stick of her furniture went into it--the new\nhouse, I repeat, opened with six eating boarders at ten dollars a\nmonth apiece, and two eating and sleeping at eleven, besides Mr. Pike,\nwho made a special contract. Transient custom was hoped to hold its\nown, and that of the county people under the deputy's patronage and\ninfluence to be considerably enlarged.\n\nIn words and other encouragement Mr. Pike was pronounced. He could\ncommend honestly, and he did so cordially.\n\n\"The thing to do, Pink, is to have your prices reg'lar, and make\npeople pay up reg'lar. Ten dollars for eatin', jes' so; eleb'n for\neatin' _an_' sleepin'; half a dollar for dinner, jes' so; quarter\napiece for breakfast, supper, and bed, is what I call reason'ble bo'd.\nAs for me, I sca'cely know how to rig'late, because, you know, I'm a'\nofficer now, an' in course I natchel _has_ to be away sometimes an' on\nexpenses at 'tother places, an' it seem like some 'lowance ought by\ngood rights to be made for that; don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Why, matter o' course, Matt; what you think? I ain't so powerful good\nat figgers. Nervy is. S'posen you speak to her 'bout it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's perfec' unuseless, Pink. I'm a' officer o' the law, Pink,\nan' the law consider women--well, I may say the law, _she_ deal 'ith\n_men_, not women, an' she expect her officers to understan' figgers,\nan' if I hadn't o' understood figgers Mr. Sanks wouldn't or darsnt' to\n'p'int me his dep'ty. Me 'n' you can fix them terms. Now see here,\nreg'lar bo'd--eatin' bo'd, I mean--is ten dollars, an' sleepin' and\nsinguil meals is 'cordin' to the figgers you've sot for 'em. Ain't\nthat so? Jes' so. Now, Pink, you an' me'll keep a runnin' account, you\na-chargin' for reg'lar bo'd, an' I a'lowin' to myself credics for my\nabsentees, accordin' to transion customers an' singuil mealers an'\nsleepers. Is that fa'r, er is it not fa'r?\"\n\nMr. Fluker turned his head, and after making or thinking he had made a\ncalculation, answered:\n\n\"That's--that seem fa'r, Matt.\"\n\n\"Cert'nly 'tis, Pink; I knowed you'd say so, an' you know I'd never\nwish to be nothin' but fa'r 'ith people I like, like I do you an' your\nwife. Let that be the understandin', then, betwix' us. An' Pink, let\nthe understandin' be jes' betwix' _us_, for I've saw enough o' this\nworld to find out that a man never makes nothin' by makin' a blowin'\nhorn o' his business. You make the t'others pay up spuntial, monthly.\nYou 'n' me can settle whensomever it's convenant, say three months\nfrom to-day. In course I shall talk up for the house whensomever and\nwharsomever I go or stay. You know that. An' as for my bed,\" said Mr.\nPike finally, \"whensomever I ain't here by bed-time, you welcome to\nput any transion person in it, an' also an' likewise, when transion\ncustom is pressin', and you cramped for beddin', I'm willin' to give\nit up for the time bein'; an' rather'n you should be cramped too bad,\nI'll take my chances somewhars else, even if I has to take a pallet at\nthe head o' the sta'r-steps.\"\n\n\"Nervy,\" said Mr. Fluker to his wife afterwards, \"Matt Pike's a\nsensibler an' a friendlier an' a 'commodatiner feller'n I thought.\"\n\nThen, without giving details of the contract, he mentioned merely the\nwillingness of their boarder to resign his bed on occasions of\npressing emergency.\n\n\"He's talked mighty fine to me and Marann,\" answered Mrs. Fluker.\n\"We'll see how he holds out. One thing I do not like of his doin', an'\nthat's the talkin' 'bout Sim Marchman to Marann, an' makin' game o'\nhis country ways, as he call 'em. Sech as that ain't right.\"\n\nIt may be as well to explain just here that Simeon Marchman, the\nperson just named by Mrs. Fluker, a stout, industrious young farmer,\nresiding with his parents in the country near by where the Flukers had\ndwelt before removing to town, had been eying Marann for a year or\ntwo, and waiting upon her fast-ripening womanhood with intentions\nthat, he believed to be hidden in his own breast, though he had taken\nless pains to conceal them from Marann than from the rest of his\nacquaintance. Not that he had ever told her of them in so many words,\nbut--Oh, I need not stop here in the midst of this narration to\nexplain how such intentions become known, or at least strongly\nsuspected by girls, even those less bright than Marann Fluker. Simeon\nhad not cordially indorsed the movement into town, though, of course,\nknowing it was none of his business, he had never so much as hinted\nopposition. I would not be surprised, also, if he reflected that there\nmight be some selfishness in his hostility, or at least that it was\nheightened by apprehensions personal to himself.\n\nConsidering the want of experience in the new tenants, matters went on\nremarkably well. Mrs. Fluker, accustomed to rise from her couch long\nbefore the lark, managed to the satisfaction of all,--regular\nboarders, single-meal takers, and transient people. Marann went to the\nvillage school, her mother dressing her, though with prudent economy,\nas neatly and almost as tastefully as any of her schoolmates; while,\nas to study, deportment, and general progress, there was not a girl in\nthe whole school to beat her, I don't care who she was.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nDuring a not inconsiderable period Mr. Fluker indulged the honorable\nconviction that at last he had found the vein in which his best\ntalents lay, and he was happy in foresight of the prosperity and\nfelicity which that discovery promised to himself and his family. His\nnative activity found many more objects for its exertion than before.\nHe rode out to the farm, not often, but sometimes, as a matter of\nduty, and was forced to acknowledge that Sam was managing better than\ncould have been expected in the absence of his own continuous\nguidance. In town he walked about the hotel, entertained the guests,\ncarved at the meals, hovered about the stores, the doctors' offices,\nthe wagon and blacksmith shops, discussed mercantile, medical,\nmechanical questions with specialists in all these departments,\nthrowing into them all more and more of politics as the intimacy\nbetween him and his patron and chief boarder increased.\n\nNow as to that patron and chief boarder. The need of extending his\nacquaintance seemed to press upon Mr. Pike with ever-increasing\nweight. He was here and there, all over the county; at the\ncounty-seat, at the county villages, at justices' courts, at\nexecutors' and administrators' sales, at quarterly and protracted\nreligious meetings, at barbecues of every dimension, on hunting\nexcursions and fishing frolics, at social parties in all\nneighborhoods. It got to be said of Mr. Pike that a freer acceptor of\nhospitable invitations, or a better appreciator of hospitable\nintentions, was not and needed not to be found possibly in the whole\nstate. Nor was this admirable deportment confined to the county in\nwhich he held so high official position. He attended, among other\noccasions less public, the spring sessions of the supreme and county\ncourts in the four adjoining counties: the guest of acquaintance old\nand new over there. When starting upon such travels, he would\nsometimes breakfast with his traveling companion in the village, and,\nif somewhat belated in the return, sup with him also.\n\nYet, when at Flukers', no man could have been a more cheerful and\notherwise satisfactory boarder than Mr. Matt Pike. He praised every\ndish set before him, bragged to their very faces of his host and\nhostess, and in spite of his absences was the oftenest to sit and chat\nwith Marann when her mother would let her go into the parlor. Here and\neverywhere about the house, in the dining-room, in the passage, at the\nfoot of the stairs, he would joke with Marann about her country beau,\nas he styled poor Sim Marchman, and he would talk as though he was\nrather ashamed of Sim, and wanted Marann to string her bow for higher\ngame.\n\nBrer Sam did manage well, not only the fields, but the yard. Every\nSaturday of the world he sent in something or other to his sister. I\ndon't know whether I ought to tell it or not, but for the sake of what\nis due to pure veracity I will. On as many as three different\noccasions Sim Marchman, as if he had lost all self-respect, or had not\na particle of tact, brought in himself, instead of sending by a negro,\na bucket of butter and a coop of spring chickens as a free gift to\nMrs. Fluker. I do think, on my soul, that Mr. Matt Pike was much\namused by such degradation--however, he must say that they were all\nfirst-rate. As for Marann, she was very sorry for Sim, and wished he\nhad not brought these good things at all.\n\nNobody knew how it came about; but when the Flukers had been in town\nsomewhere between two and three months, Sim Marchman, who (to use his\nown words) had never bothered her a great deal with his visits, began\nto suspect that what few he made were received by Marann lately with\nless cordiality than before; and so one day, knowing no better, in his\nawkward, straightforward country manners, he wanted to know the reason\nwhy. Then Marann grew distant, and asked Sim the following question:\n\n\"You know where Mr. Pike's gone, Mr. Marchman?\"\n\nNow the fact was, and she knew it, that Marann Fluker had never\nbefore, not since she was born, addressed that boy as _Mister_.\n\nThe visitor's face reddened and reddened.\n\n\"No,\" he faltered in answer; \"no--no--_ma'am_, I should say. I--I\ndon't know where Mr. Pike's gone.\"\n\nThen he looked around for his hat, discovered it in time, took it into\nhis hands, turned it around two or three times, then, bidding good-bye\nwithout shaking hands, took himself off.\n\nMrs. Fluker liked all the Marchmans, and she was troubled somewhat\nwhen she heard of the quickness and manner of Sim's departure; for he\nhad been fully expected by her to stay to dinner.\n\n\"Say he didn't even shake hands, Marann? What for? What you do to\nhim?\"\n\n\"Not one blessed thing, ma; only he wanted to know why I wasn't\ngladder to see him.\" Then Marann looked indignant.\n\n\"Say them words, Marann?\"\n\n\"No, but he hinted 'em.\"\n\n\"What did you say then?\"\n\n\"I just asked, a-meaning nothing in the wide world, ma--I asked him if\nhe knew where Mr. Pike had gone.\"\n\n\"And that were answer enough to hurt his feelin's. What you want to\nknow where Matt Pike's gone for, Marann?\"\n\n\"I didn't care about knowing, ma, but I didn't like the way Sim\ntalked.\"\n\n\"Look here, Marann. Look straight at me. You'll be mighty fur off your\nfeet if you let Matt Pike put things in your head that hain't no\nbusiness a-bein' there, and special if you find yourself a-wantin' to\nknow where he's a-perambulatin' in his everlastin' meanderin's. Not a\ncent has he paid for his board, and which your pa say he have a'\nunderstandin' with him about allowin' for his absentees, which is all\nright enough, but which it's now goin' on to three mont's, and what is\ncomin' to us I need and I want. He ought, your pa ought to let me\nbargain with Matt Pike, because he know he don't understan' figgers\nlike Matt Pike. He don't know exactly what the bargain were; for I've\nasked him, and he always begins with a multiplyin' of words and never\nanswers me.\"\n\nOn his next return from his travels Mr. Pike noticed a coldness in\nMrs. Fluker's manner, and this enhanced his praise of the house. The\nlast week of the third month came. Mr. Pike was often noticed, before\nand after meals, standing at the desk in the hotel office (called in\nthose times the bar-room) engaged in making calculations. The day\nbefore the contract expired Mrs. Fluker, who had not indulged herself\nwith a single holiday since they had been in town, left Marann in\ncharge of the house, and rode forth, spending part of the day with\nMrs. Marchman, Sim's mother. All were glad to see her, of course, and\nshe returned smartly, freshened by the visit. That night she had a\ntalk with Marann, and oh, how Marann did cry!\n\nThe very last day came. Like insurance policies, the contract was to\nexpire at a certain hour. Sim Marchman came just before dinner, to\nwhich he was sent for by Mrs. Fluker, who had seen him as he rode into\ntown.\n\n\"Hello, Sim,\" said Mr. Pike as he took his seat opposite him. \"You\nhere? What's the news in the country? How's your health? How's crops?\"\n\n\"Jest mod'rate, Mr. Pike. Got little business with you after dinner,\nef you can spare time.\"\n\n\"All right. Got a little matter with Pink here first. 'Twon't take\nlong. See you arfter amejiant, Sim.\"\n\nNever had the deputy been more gracious and witty. He talked and\ntalked, outtalking even Mr. Fluker; he was the only man in town who\ncould do that. He winked at Marann as he put questions to Sim, some of\nthe words employed in which Sim had never heard before. Yet Sim held\nup as well as he could, and after dinner followed Marann with some\nlittle dignity into the parlor. They had not been there more than ten\nminutes when Mrs. Fluker was heard to walk rapidly along the passage\nleading from the dining-room, to enter her own chamber for only a\nmoment, then to come out and rush to the parlor door with the gig-whip\nin her hand. Such uncommon conduct in a woman like Mrs. Pink Fluker of\ncourse needs explanation.\n\nWhen all the other boarders had left the house, the deputy and Mr.\nFluker having repaired to the bar-room, the former said:\n\n\"Now, Pink, for our settlement, as you say your wife think we better\nhave one. I'd 'a' been willin' to let accounts keep on a-runnin',\nknowin' what a straightforrards sort o' man you was. Your count, ef I\nain't mistakened, is jes' thirty-three dollars, even money. Is that\nso, or is it not?\"\n\n\"That's it, to a dollar, Matt. Three times eleben make thirty-three,\ndon't it?\"\n\n\"It do, Pink, or eleben times three, jes' which you please. Now here's\nmy count, on which you'll see, Pink, that not nary cent have I charged\nfor infloonce. I has infloonced a consider'ble custom to this house,\nas you know, bo'din' and transion. But I done that out o' my respects\nof you an' Missis Fluker, an' your keepin' of a fa'r--I'll say, as\nI've said freckwent, a _very_ fa'r house. I let them infloonces go to\nfriendship, ef you'll take it so. Will you, Pink Fluker?\"\n\n\"Cert'nly, Matt, an' I'm a thousand times obleeged to you, an'--\"\n\n\"Say no more, Pink, on that p'int o' view. Ef I like a man, I know how\nto treat him. Now as to the p'ints o' absentees, my business as dep'ty\nsheriff has took me away from this inconsider'ble town freckwent,\nhain't it?\"\n\n\"It have, Matt, er somethin' else, more'n I were a expectin', an'--\"\n\n\"Jes' so. But a public officer, Pink, when jooty call on him to go, he\ngot to go; in fack he got to _goth_, as the Scripture say, ain't that\nso?\"\n\n\"I s'pose so, Matt, by good rights, a--a official speakin'.\"\n\nMr. Fluker felt that he was becoming a little confused.\n\n\"Jes' so. Now, Pink, I were to have credics for my absentees 'cordin'\nto transion an' single-meal bo'ders an' sleepers; ain't that so?\"\n\n\"I--I--somethin' o' that sort, Matt,\" he answered vaguely.\n\n\"Jes' so. Now look here,\" drawing from his pocket a paper. \"Itom one.\nTwenty-eight dinners at half a dollar makes fourteen dollars, don't\nit? Jes' so. Twenty-five breakfasts at a quarter makes six an' a\nquarter, which make dinners an' breakfasts twenty an' a quarter.\nFoller me up, as I go up, Pink. Twenty-five suppers at a quarter makes\nsix an' a quarter, an' which them added to the twenty an' a quarter\nmakes them twenty-six an' a half. Foller, Pink, an' if you ketch me in\nany mistakes in the kyarin' an' addin', p'int it out. Twenty-two an' a\nhalf beds--an' I say _half_, Pink, because you 'member one night when\nthem A'gusty lawyers got here 'bout midnight on their way to co't,\nrather'n have you too bad cramped, I ris to make way for two of 'em;\nyit as I had one good nap, I didn't think I ought to put that down but\nfor half. Them makes five dollars half an' seb'n pence, an' which\nkyar'd on to the t'other twenty-six an' a half, fetches the whole\ncabool to jes' thirty-two dollars an' seb'n pence. But I made up my\nmind I'd fling out that seb'n pence, an' jes' call it a dollar even\nmoney, an' which here's the solid silver.\"\n\nIn spite of the rapidity with which this enumeration of\ncounter-charges was made, Mr. Fluker commenced perspiring at the first\nitem, and when the balance was announced his face was covered with\nhuge drops.\n\nIt was at this juncture that Mrs. Fluker, who, well knowing her\nhusband's unfamiliarity with complicated accounts, had felt her duty\nto be listening near the bar-room door, left, and quickly afterwards\nappeared before Marann and Sim as I have represented.\n\n\"You think Matt Pike ain't tryin' to settle with your pa with a\ndollar? I'm goin' to make him keep his dollar, an' I'm goin' to give\nhim somethin' to go 'long with it.\"\n\n\"The good Lord have mercy upon us!\" exclaimed Marann, springing up and\ncatching hold of her mother's skirts, as she began her advance towards\nthe bar-room. \"Oh, ma! for the Lord's sake!--Sim, Sim, Sim, if you\ncare _any_thing for me in this wide world, don't let ma go into that\nroom!\"\n\n\"Missis Fluker,\" said Sim, rising instantly, \"wait jest two minutes\ntill I see Mr. Pike on some pressin' business; I won't keep you over\ntwo minutes a-waitin'.\"\n\nHe took her, set her down in a chair trembling, looked at her a moment\nas she began to weep, then, going out and closing the door, strode\nrapidly to the bar-room.\n\n\"Let me help you settle your board-bill, Mr. Pike, by payin' you a\nlittle one I owe you.\"\n\nDoubling his fist, he struck out with a blow that felled the deputy to\nthe floor. Then catching him by his heels, he dragged him out of the\nhouse into the street. Lifting his foot above his face, he said:\n\n\"You stir till I tell you, an' I'll stomp your nose down even with the\nbalance of your mean face. 'Tain't exactly my business how you cheated\nMr. Fluker, though, 'pon my soul, I never knowed a trifliner,\nlowdowner trick. But _I_ owed you myself for your talkin' 'bout and\nyour lyin' 'bout me, and now I've paid you; an' ef you only knowed it,\nI've saved you from a gig-whippin'. Now you may git up.\"\n\n\"Here's his dollar, Sim,\" said Mr. Fluker, throwing it out of the\nwindow. \"Nervy say make him take it.\"\n\nThe vanquished, not daring to refuse, pocketed the coin, and slunk\naway amid the jeers of a score of villagers who had been drawn to the\nscene.\n\nIn all human probability the late omission of the shaking of Sim's and\nMarann's hands was compensated at their parting that afternoon. I am\nmore confident on this point because at the end of the year those\nhands were joined inseparably by the preacher. But this was when they\nhad all gone back to their old home; for if Mr. Fluker did not become\nfully convinced that his mathematical education was not advanced quite\nenough for all the exigencies of hotel-keeping, his wife declared that\nshe had had enough of it, and that she and Marann were going home. Mr.\nFluker may be said, therefore, to have followed, rather than led, his\nfamily on the return.\n\nAs for the deputy, finding that if he did not leave it voluntarily he\nwould be drummed out of the village, he departed, whither I do not\nremember if anybody ever knew.\n\n\n\nTHE NICE PEOPLE\n\nBy Henry Cuyler Bunner (1855-1896)\n\n[From _Puck_, July 30, 1890. Republished in the volume, _Short Sixes:\nStories to Be Read While the Candle Burns_ (1891), by Henry Cuyler\nBunner; copyright, 1890, by Alice Larned Bunner; reprinted by\npermission of the publishers, Charles Scribner'a Sons.]\n\n\"They certainly are nice people,\" I assented to my wife's observation,\nusing the colloquial phrase with a consciousness that it was anything\nbut \"nice\" English, \"and I'll bet that their three children are better\nbrought up than most of----\"\n\n\"_Two_ children,\" corrected my wife.\n\n\"Three, he told me.\"\n\n\"My dear, she said there were _two_.\"\n\n\"He said three.\"\n\n\"You've simply forgotten. I'm _sure_ she told me they had only two--a\nboy and a girl.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't enter into particulars.\"\n\n\"No, dear, and you couldn't have understood him. Two children.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said; but I did not think it was all right. As a\nnear-sighted man learns by enforced observation to recognize persons\nat a distance when the face is not visible to the normal eye, so the\nman with a bad memory learns, almost unconsciously, to listen\ncarefully and report accurately. My memory is bad; but I had not had\ntime to forget that Mr. Brewster Brede had told me that afternoon that\nhe had three children, at present left in the care of his\nmother-in-law, while he and Mrs. Brede took their summer vacation.\n\n\"Two children,\" repeated my wife; \"and they are staying with his aunt\nJenny.\"\n\n\"He told me with his mother-in-law,\" I put in. My wife looked at me\nwith a serious expression. Men may not remember much of what they are\ntold about children; but any man knows the difference between an aunt\nand a mother-in-law.\n\n\"But don't you think they're nice people?\" asked my wife.\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" I replied. \"Only they seem to be a little mixed up\nabout their children.\"\n\n\"That isn't a nice thing to say,\" returned my wife. I could not deny\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd yet, the next morning, when the Bredes came down and seated\nthemselves opposite us at table, beaming and smiling in their natural,\npleasant, well-bred fashion, I knew, to a social certainty, that they\nwere \"nice\" people. He was a fine-looking fellow in his neat\ntennis-flannels, slim, graceful, twenty-eight or thirty years old,\nwith a Frenchy pointed beard. She was \"nice\" in all her pretty\nclothes, and she herself was pretty with that type of prettiness which\noutwears most other types--the prettiness that lies in a rounded\nfigure, a dusky skin, plump, rosy cheeks, white teeth and black eyes.\nShe might have been twenty-five; you guessed that she was prettier\nthan she was at twenty, and that she would be prettier still at forty.\n\nAnd nice people were all we wanted to make us happy in Mr. Jacobus's\nsummer boarding-house on top of Orange Mountain. For a week we had\ncome down to breakfast each morning, wondering why we wasted the\nprecious days of idleness with the company gathered around the Jacobus\nboard. What joy of human companionship was to be had out of Mrs. Tabb\nand Miss Hoogencamp, the two middle-aged gossips from Scranton,\nPa.--out of Mr. and Mrs. Biggle, an indurated head-bookkeeper and his\nprim and censorious wife--out of old Major Halkit, a retired business\nman, who, having once sold a few shares on commission, wrote for\ncirculars of every stock company that was started, and tried to induce\nevery one to invest who would listen to him? We looked around at those\ndull faces, the truthful indices of mean and barren minds, and decided\nthat we would leave that morning. Then we ate Mrs. Jacobus's biscuit,\nlight as Aurora's cloudlets, drank her honest coffee, inhaled the\nperfume of the late azaleas with which she decked her table, and\ndecided to postpone our departure one more day. And then we wandered\nout to take our morning glance at what we called \"our view\"; and it\nseemed to us as if Tabb and Hoogencamp and Halkit and the Biggleses\ncould not drive us away in a year.\n\nI was not surprised when, after breakfast, my wife invited the Bredes\nto walk with us to \"our view.\" The Hoogencamp-Biggle-Tabb-Halkit\ncontingent never stirred off Jacobus's veranda; but we both felt that\nthe Bredes would not profane that sacred scene. We strolled slowly\nacross the fields, passed through the little belt of woods and, as I\nheard Mrs. Brede's little cry of startled rapture, I motioned to Brede\nto look up.\n\n\"By Jove!\" he cried, \"heavenly!\"\n\nWe looked off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen miles of\nbillowing green, to where, far across a far stretch of pale blue lay a\ndim purple line that we knew was Staten Island. Towns and villages lay\nbefore us and under us; there were ridges and hills, uplands and\nlowlands, woods and plains, all massed and mingled in that great\nsilent sea of sunlit green. For silent it was to us, standing in the\nsilence of a high place--silent with a Sunday stillness that made us\nlisten, without taking thought, for the sound of bells coming up from\nthe spires that rose above the tree-tops--the tree-tops that lay as\nfar beneath us as the light clouds were above us that dropped great\nshadows upon our heads and faint specks of shade upon the broad sweep\nof land at the mountain's foot.\n\n\"And so that is _your_ view?\" asked Mrs. Brede, after a moment; \"you\nare very generous to make it ours, too.\"\n\nThen we lay down on the grass, and Brede began to talk, in a gentle\nvoice, as if he felt the influence of the place. He had paddled a\ncanoe, in his earlier days, he said, and he knew every river and creek\nin that vast stretch of landscape. He found his landmarks, and pointed\nout to us where the Passaic and the Hackensack flowed, invisible to\nus, hidden behind great ridges that in our sight were but combings of\nthe green waves upon which we looked down. And yet, on the further\nside of those broad ridges and rises were scores of villages--a little\nworld of country life, lying unseen under our eyes.\n\n\"A good deal like looking at humanity,\" he said; \"there is such a\nthing as getting so far above our fellow men that we see only one side\nof them.\"\n\nAh, how much better was this sort of talk than the chatter and gossip\nof the Tabb and the Hoogencamp--than the Major's dissertations upon\nhis everlasting circulars! My wife and I exchanged glances.\n\n\"Now, when I went up the Matterhorn\" Mr. Brede began.\n\n\"Why, dear,\" interrupted his wife, \"I didn't know you ever went up the\nMatterhorn.\"\n\n\"It--it was five years ago,\" said Mr. Brede, hurriedly. \"I--I didn't\ntell you--when I was on the other side, you know--it was rather\ndangerous--well, as I was saying--it looked--oh, it didn't look at all\nlike this.\"\n\nA cloud floated overhead, throwing its great shadow over the field\nwhere we lay. The shadow passed over the mountain's brow and\nreappeared far below, a rapidly decreasing blot, flying eastward over\nthe golden green. My wife and I exchanged glances once more.\n\nSomehow, the shadow lingered over us all. As we went home, the Bredes\nwent side by side along the narrow path, and my wife and I walked\ntogether.\n\n\"_Should you think_,\" she asked me, \"that a man would climb the\nMatterhorn the very first year he was married?\"\n\n\"I don't know, my dear,\" I answered, evasively; \"this isn't the first\nyear I have been married, not by a good many, and I wouldn't climb\nit--for a farm.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean,\" she said.\n\nI did.\n\n       *        *        *        *        *\n\nWhen we reached the boarding-house, Mr. Jacobus took me aside.\n\n\"You know,\" he began his discourse, \"my wife she uset to live in N'\nYork!\"\n\nI didn't know, but I said \"Yes.\"\n\n\"She says the numbers on the streets runs criss-cross-like.\nThirty-four's on one side o' the street an' thirty-five on t'other.\nHow's that?\"\n\n\"That is the invariable rule, I believe.\"\n\n\"Then--I say--these here new folk that you 'n' your wife seem so\nmighty taken up with--d'ye know anything about 'em?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about the character of your boarders, Mr. Jacobus,\" I\nreplied, conscious of some irritability. \"If I choose to associate\nwith any of them----\"\n\n\"Jess so--jess so!\" broke in Jacobus. \"I hain't nothin' to say ag'inst\nyer sosherbil'ty. But do ye _know_ them?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly not,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well--that was all I wuz askin' ye. Ye see, when _he_ come here to\ntake the rooms--you wasn't here then--he told my wife that he lived at\nnumber thirty-four in his street. An' yistiddy _she_ told her that\nthey lived at number thirty-five. He said he lived in an\napartment-house. Now there can't be no apartment-house on two sides of\nthe same street, kin they?\"\n\n\"What street was it?\" I inquired, wearily.\n\n\"Hundred 'n' twenty-first street.\"\n\n\"May be,\" I replied, still more wearily. \"That's Harlem. Nobody knows\nwhat people will do in Harlem.\"\n\nI went up to my wife's room.\n\n\"Don't you think it's queer?\" she asked me.\n\n\"I think I'll have a talk with that young man to-night,\" I said, \"and\nsee if he can give some account of himself.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" my wife said, gravely, \"_she_ doesn't know whether\nthey've had the measles or not.\"\n\n\"Why, Great Scott!\" I exclaimed, \"they must have had them when they\nwere children.\"\n\n\"Please don't be stupid,\" said my wife. \"I meant _their_ children.\"\n\nAfter dinner that night--or rather, after supper, for we had dinner in\nthe middle of the day at Jacobus's--I walked down the long verandah to\nask Brede, who was placidly smoking at the other end, to accompany me\non a twilight stroll. Half way down I met Major Halkit.\n\n\"That friend of yours,\" he said, indicating the unconscious figure at\nthe further end of the house, \"seems to be a queer sort of a Dick. He\ntold me that he was out of business, and just looking round for a\nchance to invest his capital. And I've been telling him what an\neverlasting big show he had to take stock in the Capitoline Trust\nCompany--starts next month--four million capital--I told you all about\nit. 'Oh, well,' he says, 'let's wait and think about it.' 'Wait!' says\nI, 'the Capitoline Trust Company won't wait for _you_, my boy. This is\nletting you in on the ground floor,' says I, 'and it's now or never.'\n'Oh, let it wait,' says he. I don't know what's in-_to_ the man.\"\n\n\"I don't know how well he knows his own business, Major,\" I said as I\nstarted again for Brede's end of the veranda. But I was troubled none\nthe less. The Major could not have influenced the sale of one share of\nstock in the Capitoline Company. But that stock was a great\ninvestment; a rare chance for a purchaser with a few thousand dollars.\nPerhaps it was no more remarkable that Brede should not invest than\nthat I should not--and yet, it seemed to add one circumstance more to\nthe other suspicious circumstances.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I went upstairs that evening, I found my wife putting her hair to\nbed--I don't know how I can better describe an operation familiar to\nevery married man. I waited until the last tress was coiled up, and\nthen I spoke:\n\n\"I've talked with Brede,\" I said, \"and I didn't have to catechize him.\nHe seemed to feel that some sort of explanation was looked for, and he\nwas very outspoken. You were right about the children--that is, I must\nhave misunderstood him. There are only two. But the Matterhorn episode\nwas simple enough. He didn't realize how dangerous it was until he had\ngot so far into it that he couldn't back out; and he didn't tell her,\nbecause he'd left her here, you see, and under the circumstances----\"\n\n\"Left her here!\" cried my wife. \"I've been sitting with her the whole\nafternoon, sewing, and she told me that he left her at Geneva, and\ncame back and took her to Basle, and the baby was born there--now I'm\nsure, dear, because I asked her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was mistaken when I thought he said she was on this side of\nthe water,\" I suggested, with bitter, biting irony.\n\n\"You poor dear, did I abuse you?\" said my wife. \"But, do you know,\nMrs. Tabb said that _she_ didn't know how many lumps of sugar he took\nin his coffee. Now that seems queer, doesn't it?\"\n\nIt did. It was a small thing. But it looked queer, Very queer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning, it was clear that war was declared against the\nBredes. They came down to breakfast somewhat late, and, as soon as\nthey arrived, the Biggleses swooped up the last fragments that\nremained on their plates, and made a stately march out of the\ndining-room, Then Miss Hoogencamp arose and departed, leaving a whole\nfish-ball on her plate. Even as Atalanta might have dropped an apple\nbehind her to tempt her pursuer to check his speed, so Miss Hoogencamp\nleft that fish-ball behind her, and between her maiden self and\ncontamination.\n\nWe had finished our breakfast, my wife and I, before the Bredes\nappeared. We talked it over, and agreed that we were glad that we had\nnot been obliged to take sides upon such insufficient testimony.\n\nAfter breakfast, it was the custom of the male half of the Jacobus\nhousehold to go around the corner of the building and smoke their\npipes and cigars where they would not annoy the ladies. We sat under a\ntrellis covered with a grapevine that had borne no grapes in the\nmemory of man. This vine, however, bore leaves, and these, on that\npleasant summer morning, shielded from us two persons who were in\nearnest conversation in the straggling, half-dead flower-garden at the\nside of the house.\n\n\"I don't want,\" we heard Mr. Jacobus say, \"to enter in no man's\n_pry_-vacy; but I do want to know who it may be, like, that I hev in\nmy house. Now what I ask of _you_, and I don't want you to take it as\nin no ways _personal_, is--hev you your merridge-license with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" we heard the voice of Mr. Brede reply. \"Have you yours?\"\n\nI think it was a chance shot; but it told all the same. The Major (he\nwas a widower) and Mr. Biggle and I looked at each other; and Mr.\nJacobus, on the other side of the grape-trellis, looked at--I don't\nknow what--and was as silent as we were.\n\nWhere is _your_ marriage-license, married reader? Do you know? Four\nmen, not including Mr. Brede, stood or sat on one side or the other of\nthat grape-trellis, and not one of them knew where his\nmarriage-license was. Each of us had had one--the Major had had three.\nBut where were they? Where is _yours?_ Tucked in your best-man's\npocket; deposited in his desk--or washed to a pulp in his white\nwaistcoat (if white waistcoats be the fashion of the hour), washed out\nof existence--can you tell where it is? Can you--unless you are one of\nthose people who frame that interesting document and hang it upon\ntheir drawing-room walls?\n\nMr. Brede's voice arose, after an awful stillness of what seemed like\nfive minutes, and was, probably, thirty seconds:\n\n\"Mr. Jacobus, will you make out your bill at once, and let me pay it?\nI shall leave by the six o'clock train. And will you also send the\nwagon for my trunks?\"\n\n\"I hain't said I wanted to hev ye leave----\" began Mr. Jacobus; but\nBrede cut him short.\n\n\"Bring me your bill.\"\n\n\"But,\" remonstrated Jacobus, \"ef ye ain't----\"\n\n\"Bring me your bill!\" said Mr. Brede.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy wife and I went out for our morning's walk. But it seemed to us,\nwhen we looked at \"our view,\" as if we could only see those invisible\nvillages of which Brede had told us--that other side of the ridges and\nrises of which we catch no glimpse from lofty hills or from the\nheights of human self-esteem. We meant to stay out until the Bredes\nhad taken their departure; but we returned just in time to see Pete,\nthe Jacobus darkey, the blacker of boots, the brasher of coats, the\ngeneral handy-man of the house, loading the Brede trunks on the\nJacobus wagon.\n\nAnd, as we stepped upon the verandah, down came Mrs. Brede, leaning on\nMr. Brede's arm, as though she were ill; and it was clear that she had\nbeen crying. There were heavy rings about her pretty black eyes.\n\nMy wife took a step toward her.\n\n\"Look at that dress, dear,\" she whispered; \"she never thought anything\nlike this was going to happen when she put _that_ on.\"\n\nIt was a pretty, delicate, dainty dress, a graceful, narrow-striped\naffair. Her hat was trimmed with a narrow-striped silk of the same\ncolors--maroon and white--and in her hand she held a parasol that\nmatched her dress.\n\n\"She's had a new dress on twice a day,\" said my wife, \"but that's the\nprettiest yet. Oh, somehow--I'm _awfully_ sorry they're going!\"\n\nBut going they were. They moved toward the steps. Mrs. Brede looked\ntoward my wife, and my wife moved toward Mrs. Brede. But the\nostracized woman, as though she felt the deep humiliation of her\nposition, turned sharply away, and opened her parasol to shield her\neyes from the sun. A shower of rice--a half-pound shower of rice--fell\ndown over her pretty hat and her pretty dress, and fell in a\nspattering circle on the floor, outlining her skirts--and there it lay\nin a broad, uneven band, bright in the morning sun.\n\nMrs. Brede was in my wife's arms, sobbing as if her young heart would\nbreak.\n\n\"Oh, you poor, dear, silly children!\" my wife cried, as Mrs. Brede\nsobbed on her shoulder, \"why _didn't_ you tell us?\"\n\n\"W-W-W-We didn't want to be t-t-taken for a b-b-b-b-bridal couple,\"\nsobbed Mrs. Brede; \"and we d-d-didn't _dream_ what awful lies we'd\nhave to tell, and all the aw-awful mixed-up-ness of it. Oh, dear,\ndear, dear!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Pete!\" commanded Mr. Jacobus, \"put back them trunks. These folks\nstays here's long's they wants ter. Mr. Brede\"--he held out a large,\nhard hand--\"I'd orter've known better,\" he said. And my last doubt of\nMr. Brede vanished as he shook that grimy hand in manly fashion.\n\nThe two women were walking off toward \"our view,\" each with an arm\nabout the other's waist--touched by a sudden sisterhood of sympathy.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Brede, addressing Jacobus, Biggle, the Major and\nme, \"there is a hostelry down the street where they sell honest New\nJersey beer. I recognize the obligations of the situation.\"\n\nWe five men filed down the street. The two women went toward the\npleasant slope where the sunlight gilded the forehead of the great\nhill. On Mr. Jacobus's veranda lay a spattered circle of shining\ngrains of rice. Two of Mr. Jacobus's pigeons flew down and picked up\nthe shining grains, making grateful noises far down in their throats.\n\n\n\nTHE BULLER-PODINGTON COMPACT\n\nBY FRANK RICHARD STOCKTON (1834-1902)\n\n[From _Scribner's Magazine_, August, 1897. Republished in _Afield and\nAfloat_, by Frank Richard Stockton; copyright, 1900, by Charles\nScribner's Sons. Reprinted by permission of the publishers.]\n\n\"I tell you, William,\" said Thomas Buller to his friend Mr. Podington,\n\"I am truly sorry about it, but I cannot arrange for it this year.\nNow, as to _my_ invitation--that is very different.\"\n\n\"Of course it is different,\" was the reply, \"but I am obliged to say,\nas I said before, that I really cannot accept it.\"\n\nRemarks similar to these had been made by Thomas Buller and William\nPodington at least once a year for some five years. They were old\nfriends; they had been schoolboys together and had been associated in\nbusiness since they were young men. They had now reached a vigorous\nmiddle age; they were each married, and each had a house in the\ncountry in which he resided for a part of the year. They were warmly\nattached to each other, and each was the best friend which the other\nhad in this world. But during all these years neither of them had\nvisited the other in his country home.\n\nThe reason for this avoidance of each other at their respective rural\nresidences may be briefly stated. Mr. Buller's country house was\nsituated by the sea, and he was very fond of the water. He had a good\ncat-boat, which he sailed himself with much judgment and skill, and it\nwas his greatest pleasure to take his friends and visitors upon little\nexcursions on the bay. But Mr. Podington was desperately afraid of the\nwater, and he was particularly afraid of any craft sailed by an\namateur. If his friend Buller would have employed a professional\nmariner, of years and experience, to steer and manage his boat,\nPodington might have been willing to take an occasional sail; but as\nBuller always insisted upon sailing his own boat, and took it ill if\nany of his visitors doubted his ability to do so properly, Podington\ndid not wish to wound the self-love of his friend, and he did not wish\nto be drowned. Consequently he could not bring himself to consent to\ngo to Buller's house by the sea.\n\nTo receive his good friend Buller at his own house in the beautiful\nupland region in which he lived would have been a great joy to Mr.\nPodington; but Buller could not be induced to visit him. Podington was\nvery fond of horses and always drove himself, while Buller was more\nafraid of horses than he was of elephants or lions. To one or more\nhorses driven by a coachman of years and experience he did not always\nobject, but to a horse driven by Podington, who had much experience\nand knowledge regarding mercantile affairs, but was merely an amateur\nhorseman, he most decidedly and strongly objected. He did not wish to\nhurt his friend's feelings by refusing to go out to drive with him,\nbut he would not rack his own nervous system by accompanying him.\nTherefore it was that he had not yet visited the beautiful upland\ncountry residence of Mr. Podington.\n\nAt last this state of things grew awkward. Mrs. Buller and Mrs.\nPodington, often with their families, visited each other at their\ncountry houses, but the fact that on these occasions they were never\naccompanied by their husbands caused more and more gossip among their\nneighbors both in the upland country and by the sea.\n\nOne day in spring as the two sat in their city office, where Mr.\nPodington had just repeated his annual invitation, his friend replied\nto him thus:\n\n\"William, if I come to see you this summer, will you visit me? The\nthing is beginning to look a little ridiculous, and people are talking\nabout it.\"\n\nMr. Podington put his hand to his brow and for a few moments closed\nhis eyes. In his mind he saw a cat-boat upon its side, the sails\nspread out over the water, and two men, almost entirely immersed in\nthe waves, making efforts to reach the side of the boat. One of these\nwas getting on very well--that was Buller. The other seemed about to\nsink, his arms were uselessly waving in the air--that was himself. But\nhe opened his eyes and looked bravely out of the window; it was time\nto conquer all this; it was indeed growing ridiculous. Buller had been\nsailing many years and had never been upset.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he; \"I will do it; I am ready any time you name.\"\n\nMr. Buller rose and stretched out his hand.\n\n\"Good!\" said he; \"it is a compact!\"\n\nBuller was the first to make the promised country visit. He had not\nmentioned the subject of horses to his friend, but he knew through\nMrs. Buller that Podington still continued to be his own driver. She\nhad informed him, however, that at present he was accustomed to drive\na big black horse which, in her opinion, was as gentle and reliable as\nthese animals ever became, and she could not imagine how anybody could\nbe afraid of him. So when, the next morning after his arrival, Mr.\nBuller was asked by his host if he would like to take a drive, he\nsuppressed a certain rising emotion and said that it would please him\nvery much.\n\nWhen the good black horse had jogged along a pleasant road for half an\nhour Mr. Buller began to feel that, perhaps, for all these years he\nhad been laboring under a misconception. It seemed to be possible that\nthere were some horses to which surrounding circumstances in the shape\nof sights and sounds were so irrelevant that they were to a certain\ndegree entirely safe, even when guided and controlled by an amateur\nhand. As they passed some meadow-land, somebody behind a hedge fired a\ngun; Mr. Buller was frightened, but the horse was not.\n\n\"William,\" said Buller, looking cheerfully around him,\n\n\"I had no idea that you lived in such a pretty country. In fact, I\nmight almost call it beautiful. You have not any wide stretch of\nwater, such as I like so much, but here is a pretty river, those\nrolling hills are very charming, and, beyond, you have the blue of the\nmountains.\"\n\n\"It is lovely,\" said his friend; \"I never get tired of driving through\nthis country. Of course the seaside is very fine, but here we have\nsuch a variety of scenery.\"\n\nMr. Buller could not help thinking that sometimes the seaside was a\nlittle monotonous, and that he had lost a great deal of pleasure by\nnot varying his summers by going up to spend a week or two with\nPodington.\n\n\"William,\" said he, \"how long have you had this horse?\"\n\n\"About two years,\" said Mr. Podington; \"before I got him, I used to\ndrive a pair.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" thought Buller, \"how lucky I was not to come two years\nago!\" And his regrets for not sooner visiting his friend greatly\ndecreased.\n\nNow they came to a place where the stream, by which the road ran, had\nbeen dammed for a mill and had widened into a beautiful pond.\n\n\"There now!\" cried Mr. Buller. \"That's what I like. William, you seem\nto have everything! This is really a very pretty sheet of water, and\nthe reflections of the trees over there make a charming picture; you\ncan't get that at the seaside, you know.\"\n\nMr. Podington was delighted; his face glowed; he was rejoiced at the\npleasure of his friend. \"I tell you, Thomas,\" said he, \"that----\"\n\n\"William!\" exclaimed Buller, with a sudden squirm in his seat, \"what\nis that I hear? Is that a train?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Podington, \"that is the ten-forty, up.\"\n\n\"Does it come near here?\" asked Mr. Buller, nervously. \"Does it go\nover that bridge?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Podington, \"but it can't hurt us, for our road goes under\nthe bridge; we are perfectly safe; there is no risk of accident.\"\n\n\"But your horse! Your horse!\" exclaimed Buller, as the train came\nnearer and nearer. \"What will he do?\"\n\n\"Do?\" said Podington; \"he'll do what he is doing now; he doesn't mind\ntrains.\"\n\n\"But look here, William,\" exclaimed Buller, \"it will get there just as\nwe do; no horse could stand a roaring up in the air like that!\"\n\nPodington laughed. \"He would not mind it in the least,\" said he.\n\n\"Come, come now,\" cried Buller. \"Really, I can't stand this! Just stop\na minute, William, and let me get out. It sets all my nerves\nquivering.\"\n\nMr. Podington smiled with a superior smile. \"Oh, you needn't get out,\"\nsaid he; \"there's not the least danger in the world. But I don't want\nto make you nervous, and I will turn around and drive the other way.\"\n\n\"But you can't!\" screamed Buller. \"This road is not wide enough, and\nthat train is nearly here. Please stop!\"\n\nThe imputation that the road was not wide enough for him to turn was\ntoo much for Mr. Podington to bear. He was very proud of his ability\nto turn a vehicle in a narrow place.\n\n\"Turn!\" said he; \"that's the easiest thing in the world. See; a little\nto the right, then a back, then a sweep to the left and we will be\ngoing the other way.\" And instantly he began the maneuver in which he\nwas such an adept.\n\n\"Oh, Thomas!\" cried Buller, half rising in his seat, \"that train is\nalmost here!\"\n\n\"And we are almost----\" Mr. Podington was about to say \"turned\naround,\" but he stopped. Mr. Buller's exclamations had made him a\nlittle nervous, and, in his anxiety to turn quickly, he had pulled\nupon his horse's bit with more energy than was actually necessary, and\nhis nervousness being communicated to the horse, that animal backed\nwith such extraordinary vigor that the hind wheels of the wagon went\nover a bit of grass by the road and into the water. The sudden jolt\ngave a new impetus to Mr. Buller's fears.\n\n\"You'll upset!\" he cried, and not thinking of what he was about, he\nlaid hold of his friend's arm. The horse, startled by this sudden jerk\nupon his bit, which, combined with the thundering of the train, which\nwas now on the bridge, made him think that something extraordinary was\nabout to happen, gave a sudden and forcible start backward, so that\nnot only the hind wheels of the light wagon, but the fore wheels and\nhis own hind legs went into the water. As the bank at this spot sloped\nsteeply, the wagon continued to go backward, despite the efforts of\nthe agitated horse to find a footing on the crumbling edge of the\nbank.\n\n\"Whoa!\" cried Mr. Buller.\n\n\"Get up!\" exclaimed Mr. Podington, applying his whip upon the plunging\nbeast.\n\nBut exclamations and castigations had no effect upon the horse. The\noriginal bed of the stream ran close to the road, and the bank was so\nsteep and the earth so soft that it was impossible for the horse to\nadvance or even maintain his footing. Back, back he went, until the\nwhole equipage was in the water and the wagon was afloat.\n\nThis vehicle was a road wagon, without a top, and the joints of its\nbox-body were tight enough to prevent the water from immediately\nentering it; so, somewhat deeply sunken, it rested upon the water.\nThere was a current in this part of the pond and it turned the wagon\ndownstream. The horse was now entirely immersed in the water, with the\nexception of his head and the upper part of his neck, and, unable to\nreach the bottom with his feet, he made vigorous efforts to swim.\n\nMr. Podington, the reins and whip in his hands, sat horrified and\npale; the accident was so sudden, he was so startled and so frightened\nthat, for a moment, he could not speak a word. Mr. Buller, on the\nother hand, was now lively and alert. The wagon had no sooner floated\naway from the shore than he felt himself at home. He was upon his\nfavorite element; water had no fears for him. He saw that his friend\nwas nearly frightened out of his wits, and that, figuratively\nspeaking, he must step to the helm and take charge of the vessel. He\nstood up and gazed about him.\n\n\"Put her across stream!\" he shouted; \"she can't make headway against\nthis current. Head her to that clump of trees on the other side; the\nbank is lower there, and we can beach her. Move a little the other\nway, we must trim boat. Now then, pull on your starboard rein.\"\n\nPodington obeyed, and the horse slightly changed his direction.\n\n\"You see,\" said Buller, \"it won't do to sail straight across, because\nthe current would carry us down and land us below that spot.\"\n\nMr. Podington said not a word; he expected every moment to see the\nhorse sink into a watery grave.\n\n\"It isn't so bad after all, is it, Podington? If we had a rudder and a\nbit of a sail it would be a great help to the horse. This wagon is not\na bad boat.\"\n\nThe despairing Podington looked at his feet. \"It's coming in,\" he said\nin a husky voice. \"Thomas, the water is over my shoes!\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Buller. \"I am so used to water I didn't notice it.\nShe leaks. Do you carry anything to bail her out with?\"\n\n\"Bail!\" cried Podington, now finding his voice. \"Oh, Thomas, we are\nsinking!\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Buller; \"she leaks like a sieve.\"\n\nThe weight of the running-gear and of the two men was entirely too\nmuch for the buoyancy of the wagon body. The water rapidly rose toward\nthe top of its sides.\n\n\"We are going to drown!\" cried Podington, suddenly rising.\n\n\"Lick him! Lick him!\" exclaimed Buller. \"Make him swim faster!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to lick,\" cried Podington, vainly lashing at the\nwater, for he could not reach the horse's head. The poor man was\ndreadfully frightened; he had never even imagined it possible that he\nshould be drowned in his own wagon.\n\n\"Whoop!\" cried Buller, as the water rose over the sides. \"Steady\nyourself, old boy, or you'll go overboard!\" And the next moment the\nwagon body sunk out of sight.\n\nBut it did not go down very far. The deepest part of the channel of\nthe stream had been passed, and with a bump the wheels struck the\nbottom.\n\n\"Heavens!\" exclaimed Buller, \"we are aground.\"\n\n\"Aground!\" exclaimed Podington, \"Heaven be praised!\"\n\nAs the two men stood up in the submerged wagon the water was above\ntheir knees, and when Podington looked out over the surface of the\npond, now so near his face, it seemed like a sheet of water he had\nnever seen before. It was something horrible, threatening to rise and\nenvelop him. He trembled so that he could scarcely keep his footing.\n\n\"William,\" said his companion, \"you must sit down; if you don't,\nyou'll tumble overboard and be drowned. There is nothing for you to\nhold to.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Podington, gazing blankly at the water around him, \"I\ncan't do that!\"\n\nAt this moment the horse made a slight movement. Having touched bottom\nafter his efforts in swimming across the main bed of the stream, with\na floating wagon in tow, he had stood for a few moments, his head and\nneck well above water, and his back barely visible beneath the\nsurface. Having recovered his breath, he now thought it was time to\nmove on.\n\nAt the first step of the horse Mr. Podington began to totter.\nInstinctively he clutched Buller.\n\n\"Sit down!\" cried the latter, \"or you'll have us both overboard.\"\nThere was no help for it; down sat Mr. Podington; and, as with a great\nsplash he came heavily upon the seat, the water rose to his waist.\n\n\"Ough!\" said he. \"Thomas, shout for help.\"\n\n\"No use doing that,\" replied Buller, still standing on his nautical\nlegs; \"I don't see anybody, and I don't see any boat. We'll get out\nall right. Just you stick tight to the thwart.\"\n\n\"The what?\" feebly asked the other.\n\n\"Oh, the seat, I mean. We can get to the shore all right if you steer\nthe horse straight. Head him more across the pond.\"\n\n\"I can't head him,\" cried Podington. \"I have dropped the reins!\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Mr. Buller, \"that's bad. Can't you steer him by\nshouting 'Gee' and 'Haw'?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Podington, \"he isn't an ox; but perhaps I can stop him.\"\nAnd with as much voice as he could summon, he called out: \"Whoa!\" and\nthe horse stopped.\n\n\"If you can't steer him any other way,\" said Buller, \"we must get the\nreins. Lend me your whip.\"\n\n\"I have dropped that too,\" said Podington; \"there it floats.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear,\" said Buller, \"I guess I'll have to dive for them; if he\nwere to run away, we should be in an awful fix.\"\n\n\"Don't get out! Don't get out!\" exclaimed Podington. \"You can reach\nover the dashboard.\"\n\n\"As that's under water,\" said Buller, \"it will be the same thing as\ndiving; but it's got to be done, and I'll try it. Don't you move now;\nI am more used to water than you are.\"\n\nMr. Buller took off his hat and asked his friend to hold it. He\nthought of his watch and other contents of his pockets, but there was\nno place to put them, so he gave them no more consideration. Then\nbravely getting on his knees in the water, he leaned over the\ndashboard, almost disappearing from sight. With his disengaged hand\nMr. Podington grasped the submerged coat-tails of his friend.\n\nIn a few seconds the upper part of Mr. Buller rose from the water. He\nwas dripping and puffing, and Mr. Podington could not but think what a\ndifference it made in the appearance of his friend to have his hair\nplastered close to his head.\n\n\"I got hold of one of them,\" said the sputtering Buller, \"but it was\nfast to something and I couldn't get it loose.\"\n\n\"Was it thick and wide?\" asked Podington.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer; \"it did seem so.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was a trace,\" said Podington; \"I don't want that; the reins\nare thinner and lighter.\"\n\n\"Now I remember they are,\" said Buller. \"I'll go down again.\"\n\nAgain Mr. Buller leaned over the dashboard, and this time he remained\ndown longer, and when he came up he puffed and sputtered more than\nbefore.\n\n\"Is this it?\" said he, holding up a strip of wet leather.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Podington, \"you've got the reins.\"\n\n\"Well, take them, and steer. I would have found them sooner if his\ntail had not got into my eyes. That long tail's floating down there\nand spreading itself out like a fan; it tangled itself all around my\nhead. It would have been much easier if he had been a bob-tailed\nhorse.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" said Podington, \"take your hat, Thomas, and I'll try to\ndrive.\"\n\nMr. Buller put on his hat, which was the only dry thing about him, and\nthe nervous Podington started the horse so suddenly that even the\nsea-legs of Buller were surprised, and he came very near going\nbackward into the water; but recovering himself, he sat down.\n\n\"I don't wonder you did not like to do this, William,\" said he. \"Wet\nas I am, it's ghastly!\"\n\nEncouraged by his master's voice, and by the feeling of the familiar\nhand upon his bit, the horse moved bravely on.\n\nBut the bottom was very rough and uneven. Sometimes the wheels struck\na large stone, terrifying Mr. Buller, who thought they were going to\nupset; and sometimes they sank into soft mud, horrifying Mr.\nPodington, who thought they were going to drown.\n\nThus proceeding, they presented a strange sight. At first Mr.\nPodington held his hands above the water as he drove, but he soon\nfound this awkward, and dropped them to their usual position, so that\nnothing was visible above the water but the head and neck of a horse\nand the heads and shoulders of two men.\n\nNow the submarine equipage came to a low place in the bottom, and even\nMr. Buller shuddered as the water rose to his chin. Podington gave a\nhowl of horror, and the horse, with high, uplifted head, was obliged\nto swim. At this moment a boy with a gun came strolling along the\nroad, and hearing Mr. Podington's cry, he cast his eyes over the\nwater. Instinctively he raised his weapon to his shoulder, and then,\nin an instant, perceiving that the objects he beheld were not aquatic\nbirds, he dropped his gun and ran yelling down the road toward the\nmill.\n\nBut the hollow in the bottom was a narrow one, and when it was passed\nthe depth of the water gradually decreased. The back of the horse came\ninto view, the dashboard became visible, and the bodies and the\nspirits of the two men rapidly rose. Now there was vigorous splashing\nand tugging, and then a jet black horse, shining as if he had been\nnewly varnished, pulled a dripping wagon containing two well-soaked\nmen upon a shelving shore.\n\n\"Oh, I am chilled to the bones!\" said Podington.\n\n\"I should think so,\" replied his friend; \"if you have got to be wet,\nit is a great deal pleasanter under the water.\"\n\nThere was a field-road on this side of the pond which Podington well\nknew, and proceeding along this they came to the bridge and got into\nthe main road.\n\n\"Now we must get home as fast as we can,\" cried Podington, \"or we\nshall both take cold. I wish I hadn't lost my whip. Hi now! Get\nalong!\"\n\nPodington was now full of life and energy, his wheels were on the hard\nroad, and he was himself again.\n\nWhen he found his head was turned toward his home, the horse set off\nat a great rate.\n\n\"Hi there!\" cried Podington. \"I am so sorry I lost my whip.\"\n\n\"Whip!\" said Buller, holding fast to the side of the seat; \"surely you\ndon't want him to go any faster than this. And look here, William,\" he\nadded, \"it seems to me we are much more likely to take cold in our wet\nclothes if we rush through the air in this way. Really, it seems to me\nthat horse is running away.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" cried Podington. \"He wants to get home, and he\nwants his dinner. Isn't he a fine horse? Look how he steps out!\"\n\n\"Steps out!\" said Buller, \"I think I'd like to step out myself. Don't\nyou think it would be wiser for me to walk home, William? That will\nwarm me up.\"\n\n\"It will take you an hour,\" said his friend. \"Stay where you are, and\nI'll have you in a dry suit of clothes in less than fifteen minutes.\"\n\n\"I tell you, William,\" said Mr. Buller, as the two sat smoking after\ndinner, \"what you ought to do; you should never go out driving without\na life-preserver and a pair of oars; I always take them. It would make\nyou feel safer.\"\n\nMr. Buller went home the next day, because Mr. Podington's clothes did\nnot fit him, and his own outdoor suit was so shrunken as to be\nuncomfortable. Besides, there was another reason, connected with the\ndesire of horses to reach their homes, which prompted his return. But\nhe had not forgotten his compact with his friend, and in the course of\na week he wrote to Podington, inviting him to spend some days with\nhim. Mr. Podington was a man of honor, and in spite of his recent\nunfortunate water experience he would not break his word. He went to\nMr. Buller's seaside home at the time appointed.\n\nEarly on the morning after his arrival, before the family were up, Mr.\nPodington went out and strolled down to the edge of the bay. He went\nto look at Buller's boat. He was well aware that he would be asked to\ntake a sail, and as Buller had driven with him, it would be impossible\nfor him to decline sailing with Buller; but he must see the boat.\nThere was a train for his home at a quarter past seven; if he were not\non the premises he could not be asked to sail. If Buller's boat were a\nlittle, flimsy thing, he would take that train--but he would wait and\nsee.\n\nThere was only one small boat anchored near the beach, and a\nman--apparently a fisherman--informed Mr. Podington that it belonged\nto Mr. Buller. Podington looked at it eagerly; it was not very small\nand not flimsy.\n\n\"Do you consider that a safe boat?\" he asked the fisherman.\n\n\"Safe?\" replied the man. \"You could not upset her if you tried. Look\nat her breadth of beam! You could go anywhere in that boat! Are you\nthinking of buying her?\"\n\nThe idea that he would think of buying a boat made Mr. Podington\nlaugh. The information that it would be impossible to upset the little\nvessel had greatly cheered him, and he could laugh.\n\nShortly after breakfast Mr. Buller, like a nurse with a dose of\nmedicine, came to Mr. Podington with the expected invitation to take a\nsail.\n\n\"Now, William,\" said his host, \"I understand perfectly your feeling\nabout boats, and what I wish to prove to you is that it is a feeling\nwithout any foundation. I don't want to shock you or make you nervous,\nso I am not going to take you out today on the bay in my boat. You are\nas safe on the bay as you would be on land--a little safer, perhaps,\nunder certain circumstances, to which we will not allude--but still it\nis sometimes a little rough, and this, at first, might cause you some\nuneasiness, and so I am going to let you begin your education in the\nsailing line on perfectly smooth water. About three miles back of us\nthere is a very pretty lake several miles long. It is part of the\ncanal system which connects the town with the railroad. I have sent my\nboat to the town, and we can walk up there and go by the canal to the\nlake; it is only about three miles.\"\n\nIf he had to sail at all, this kind of sailing suited Mr. Podington. A\ncanal, a quiet lake, and a boat which could not be upset. When they\nreached the town the boat was in the canal, ready for them.\n\n\"Now,\" said Mr. Buller, \"you get in and make yourself comfortable. My\nidea is to hitch on to a canal-boat and be towed to the lake. The\nboats generally start about this time in the morning, and I will go\nand see about it.\"\n\nMr. Podington, under the direction of his friend, took a seat in the\nstern of the sailboat, and then he remarked:\n\n\"Thomas, have you a life-preserver on board? You know I am not used to\nany kind of vessel, and I am clumsy. Nothing might happen to the boat,\nbut I might trip and fall overboard, and I can't swim.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Buller; \"here's a life-preserver, and you can put it\non. I want you to feel perfectly safe. Now I will go and see about the\ntow.\"\n\nBut Mr. Buller found that the canal-boats would not start at their\nusual time; the loading of one of them was not finished, and he was\ninformed that he might have to wait for an hour or more. This did not\nsuit Mr. Buller at all, and he did not hesitate to show his annoyance.\n\n\"I tell you, sir, what you can do,\" said one of the men in charge of\nthe boats; \"if you don't want to wait till we are ready to start,\nwe'll let you have a boy and a horse to tow you up to the lake. That\nwon't cost you much, and they'll be back before we want 'em.\"\n\nThe bargain was made, and Mr. Buller joyfully returned to his boat\nwith the intelligence that they were not to wait for the canal-boats.\nA long rope, with a horse attached to the other end of it, was\nspeedily made fast to the boat, and with a boy at the head of the\nhorse, they started up the canal.\n\n\"Now this is the kind of sailing I like,\" said Mr. Podington. \"If I\nlived near a canal I believe I would buy a boat and train my horse to\ntow. I could have a long pair of rope-lines and drive him myself; then\nwhen the roads were rough and bad the canal would always be smooth.\"\n\n\"This is all very nice,\" replied Mr. Buller, who sat by the tiller to\nkeep the boat away from the bank, \"and I am glad to see you in a boat\nunder any circumstances. Do you know, William, that although I did not\nplan it, there could not have been a better way to begin your sailing\neducation. Here we glide along, slowly and gently, with no possible\nthought of danger, for if the boat should suddenly spring a leak, as\nif it were the body of a wagon, all we would have to do would be to\nstep on shore, and by the time you get to the end of the canal you\nwill like this gentle motion so much that you will be perfectly ready\nto begin the second stage of your nautical education.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Podington. \"How long did you say this canal is?\"\n\n\"About three miles,\" answered his friend. \"Then we will go into the\nlock and in a few minutes we shall be on the lake.\"\n\n\"So far as I am concerned,\" said Mr. Podington, \"I wish the canal were\ntwelve miles long. I cannot imagine anything pleasanter than this. If\nI lived anywhere near a canal--a long canal, I mean, this one is too\nshort--I'd--\"\n\n\"Come, come now,\" interrupted Buller. \"Don't be content to stay in the\nprimary school just because it is easy. When we get on the lake I will\nshow you that in a boat, with a gentle breeze, such as we are likely\nto have today, you will find the motion quite as pleasing, and ever so\nmuch more inspiriting. I should not be a bit surprised, William, if\nafter you have been two or three times on the lake you will ask\nme--yes, positively ask me--to take you out on the bay!\"\n\nMr. Podington smiled, and leaning backward, he looked up at the\nbeautiful blue sky.\n\n\"You can't give me anything better than this, Thomas,\" said he; \"but\nyou needn't think I am weakening; you drove with me, and I will sail\nwith you.\"\n\nThe thought came into Buller's mind that he had done both of these\nthings with Podington, but he did not wish to call up unpleasant\nmemories, and said nothing.\n\nAbout half a mile from the town there stood a small cottage where\nhouse-cleaning was going on, and on a fence, not far from the canal,\nthere hung a carpet gaily adorned with stripes and spots of red and\nyellow.\n\nWhen the drowsy tow-horse came abreast of the house, and the carpet\ncaught his eye, he suddenly stopped and gave a start toward the canal.\nThen, impressed with a horror of the glaring apparition, he gathered\nhimself up, and with a bound dashed along the tow-path. The astounded\nboy gave a shout, but was speedily left behind. The boat of Mr. Buller\nshot forward as if she had been struck by a squall.\n\nThe terrified horse sped on as if a red and yellow demon were after\nhim. The boat bounded, and plunged, and frequently struck the grassy\nbank of the canal, as if it would break itself to pieces. Mr.\nPodington clutched the boom to keep himself from being thrown out,\nwhile Mr. Buller, both hands upon the tiller, frantically endeavored\nto keep the boat from the bank.\n\n\"William!\" he screamed, \"he is running away with us; we shall be\ndashed to pieces! Can't you get forward and cast off that line?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" cried Podington, as the boom gave a great jerk as\nif it would break its fastenings and drag him overboard.\n\n\"I mean untie the tow-line. We'll be smashed if you don't! I can't\nleave this tiller. Don't try to stand up; hold on to the boom and\ncreep forward. Steady now, or you'll be overboard!\"\n\nMr. Podington stumbled to the bow of the boat, his efforts greatly\nimpeded by the big cork life-preserver tied under his arms, and the\nmotion of the boat was so violent and erratic that he was obliged to\nhold on to the mast with one arm and to try to loosen the knot with\nthe other; but there was a great strain on the rope, and he could do\nnothing with one hand.\n\n\"Cut it! Cut it!\" cried Mr. Buller.\n\n\"I haven't a knife,\" replied Podington.\n\nMr. Buller was terribly frightened; his boat was cutting through the\nwater as never vessel of her class had sped since sail-boats were\ninvented, and bumping against the bank as if she were a billiard-ball\nrebounding from the edge of a table. He forgot he was in a boat; he\nonly knew that for the first time in his life he was in a runaway. He\nlet go the tiller. It was of no use to him.\n\n\"William,\" he cried, \"let us jump out the next time we are near enough\nto shore!\"\n\n\"Don't do that! Don't do that!\" replied Podington. \"Don't jump out in\na runaway; that is the way to get hurt. Stick to your seat, my boy; he\ncan't keep this up much longer. He'll lose his wind!\"\n\nMr. Podington was greatly excited, but he was not frightened, as\nBuller was. He had been in a runaway before, and he could not help\nthinking how much better a wagon was than a boat in such a case.\n\n\"If he were hitched up shorter and I had a snaffle-bit and a stout\npair of reins,\" thought he, \"I could soon bring him up.\"\n\nBut Mr. Buller was rapidly losing his wits. The horse seemed to be\ngoing faster than ever. The boat bumped harder against the bank, and\nat one time Buller thought they could turn over.\n\nSuddenly a thought struck him.\n\n\"William,\" he shouted, \"tip that anchor over the side! Throw it in,\nany way!\"\n\nMr. Podington looked about him, and, almost under his feet, saw the\nanchor. He did not instantly comprehend why Buller wanted it thrown\noverboard, but this was not a time to ask questions. The difficulties\nimposed by the life-preserver, and the necessity of holding on with\none hand, interfered very much with his getting at the anchor and\nthrowing it over the side, but at last he succeeded, and just as the\nboat threw up her bow as if she were about to jump on shore, the\nanchor went out and its line shot after it. There was an irregular\ntrembling of the boat as the anchor struggled along the bottom of the\ncanal; then there was a great shock; the boat ran into the bank and\nstopped; the tow-line was tightened like a guitar-string, and the\nhorse, jerked back with great violence, came tumbling in a heap upon\nthe ground.\n\nInstantly Mr. Podington was on the shore and running at the top of his\nspeed toward the horse. The astounded animal had scarcely begun to\nstruggle to his feet when Podington rushed upon him, pressed his head\nback to the ground, and sat upon it.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" he cried, waving his hat above his head. \"Get out, Buller;\nhe is all right now!\"\n\nPresently Mr. Buller approached, very much shaken up.\n\n\"All right?\" he said. \"I don't call a horse flat in a road with a man\non his head all right; but hold him down till we get him loose from my\nboat. That is the thing to do. William, cast him loose from the boat\nbefore you let him up! What will he do when he gets up?\"\n\n\"Oh. he'll be quiet enough when he gets up,\" said Podington. \"But if\nyou've got a knife you can cut his traces---I mean that rope--but no,\nyou needn't. Here comes the boy. We'll settle this business in very\nshort order now.\"\n\nWhen the horse was on his feet, and all connection between the animal\nand the boat had been severed, Mr. Podington looked at his friend.\n\n\"Thomas,\" said he, \"you seem to have had a hard time of it. You have\nlost your hat and you look as if you had been in a wrestling-match.\"\n\n\"I have,\" replied the other; \"I wrestled with that tiller and I wonder\nit didn't throw me out.\"\n\nNow approached the boy. \"Shall I hitch him on again, sir?\" said he.\n\"He's quiet enough now.\"\n\n\"No,\" cried Mr. Buller; \"I want no more sailing after a horse, and,\nbesides, we can't go on the lake with that boat; she has been battered\nabout so much that she must have opened a dozen seams. The best thing\nwe can do is to walk home.\"\n\nMr. Podington agreed with his friend that walking home was the best\nthing they could do. The boat was examined and found to be leaking,\nbut not very badly, and when her mast had been unshipped and\neverything had been made tight and right on board, she was pulled out\nof the way of tow-lines and boats, and made fast until she could be\nsent for from the town.\n\nMr. Buller and Mr. Podington walked back toward the town. They had not\ngone very far when they met a party of boys, who, upon seeing them,\nburst into unseemly laughter.\n\n\"Mister,\" cried one of them, \"you needn't be afraid of tumbling into\nthe canal. Why don't you take off your life-preserver and let that\nother man put it on his head?\"\n\nThe two friends looked at each other and could not help joining in the\nlaughter of the boys.\n\n\"By George! I forgot all about this,\" said Podington, as he unfastened\nthe cork jacket. \"It does look a little super-timid to wear a\nlife-preserver just because one happens to be walking by the side of a\ncanal.\"\n\nMr. Buller tied a handkerchief on his head, and Mr. Podington rolled\nup his life-preserver and carried it under his arm. Thus they reached\nthe town, where Buller bought a hat, Podington dispensed with his\nbundle, and arrangements were made to bring back the boat.\n\n\"Runaway in a sailboat!\" exclaimed one of the canal boatmen when he\nhad heard about the accident. \"Upon my word! That beats anything that\ncould happen to a man!\"\n\n\"No, it doesn't,\" replied Mr. Buller, quietly. \"I have gone to the\nbottom in a foundered road-wagon.\"\n\nThe man looked at him fixedly.\n\n\"Was you ever struck in the mud in a balloon?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" replied Mr. Buller.\n\nIt required ten days to put Mr. Buller's sailboat into proper\ncondition, and for ten days Mr. Podington stayed with his friend, and\nenjoyed his visit very much. They strolled on the beach, they took\nlong walks in the back country, they fished from the end of a pier,\nthey smoked, they talked, and were happy and content.\n\n\"Thomas,\" said Mr. Podington, on the last evening of his stay, \"I have\nenjoyed myself very much since I have been down here, and now, Thomas,\nif I were to come down again next summer, would you mind--would you\nmind, not----\"\n\n\"I would not mind it a bit,\" replied Buller, promptly. \"I'll never so\nmuch as mention it; so you can come along without a thought of it. And\nsince you have alluded to the subject, William,\" he continued, \"I'd\nlike very much to come and see you again; you know my visit was a very\nshort one this year. That is a beautiful country you live in. Such a\nvariety of scenery, such an opportunity for walks and rambles! But,\nWilliam, if you could only make up your mind not to----\"\n\n\"Oh, that is all right!\" exclaimed Podington. \"I do not need to make\nup my mind. You come to my house and you will never so much as hear of\nit. Here's my hand upon it!\"\n\n\"And here's mine!\" said Mr. Buller.\n\nAnd they shook hands over a new compact.\n\n\n\nCOLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF\n\nBy Bret Harte (1839-1902)\n\n[From _Harper's Magazine_, March, 1901. Republished in the volume,\n_Openings in the Old Trail_ (1902), by Bret Harte; copyright, 1902, by\nHoughton Mifflin Company, the authorized publishers of Bret Harte's\ncomplete works; reprinted by their permission.]\n\nIt had been a day of triumph for Colonel Starbottle. First, for his\npersonality, as it would have been difficult to separate the Colonel's\nachievements from his individuality; second, for his oratorical\nabilities as a sympathetic pleader; and third, for his functions as\nthe leading counsel for the Eureka Ditch Company _versus_ the State of\nCalifornia. On his strictly legal performances in this issue I prefer\nnot to speak; there were those who denied them, although the jury had\naccepted them in the face of the ruling of the half-amused,\nhalf-cynical Judge himself. For an hour they had laughed with the\nColonel, wept with him, been stirred to personal indignation or\npatriotic exaltation by his passionate and lofty periods--what else\ncould they do than give him their verdict? If it was alleged by some\nthat the American eagle, Thomas Jefferson, and the Resolutions of '98\nhad nothing whatever to do with the contest of a ditch company over a\ndoubtfully worded legislative document; that wholesale abuse of the\nState Attorney and his political motives had not the slightest\nconnection with the legal question raised--it was, nevertheless,\ngenerally accepted that the losing party would have been only too glad\nto have the Colonel on their side. And Colonel Starbottle knew this,\nas, perspiring, florid, and panting, he rebuttoned the lower buttons\nof his blue frock-coat, which had become loosed in an oratorical\nspasm, and readjusted his old-fashioned, spotless shirt frill above it\nas he strutted from the court-room amidst the hand-shakings and\nacclamations of his friends.\n\nAnd here an unprecedented thing occurred. The Colonel absolutely\ndeclined spirituous refreshment at the neighboring Palmetto Saloon,\nand declared his intention of proceeding directly to his office in the\nadjoining square. Nevertheless the Colonel quitted the building alone,\nand apparently unarmed except for his faithful gold-headed stick,\nwhich hung as usual from his forearm. The crowd gazed after him with\nundisguised admiration of this new evidence of his pluck. It was\nremembered also that a mysterious note had been handed to him at the\nconclusion of his speech--evidently a challenge from the State\nAttorney. It was quite plain that the Colonel--a practised\nduellist--was hastening home to answer it.\n\nBut herein they were wrong. The note was in a female hand, and simply\nrequested the Colonel to accord an interview with the writer at the\nColonel's office as soon as he left the court. But it was an\nengagement that the Colonel--as devoted to the fair sex as he was to\nthe \"code\"--was no less prompt in accepting. He flicked away the dust\nfrom his spotless white trousers and varnished boots with his\nhandkerchief, and settled his black cravat under his Byron collar as\nhe neared his office. He was surprised, however, on opening the door\nof his private office to find his visitor already there; he was still\nmore startled to find her somewhat past middle age and plainly\nattired. But the Colonel was brought up in a school of Southern\npoliteness, already antique in the republic, and his bow of courtesy\nbelonged to the epoch of his shirt frill and strapped trousers. No one\ncould have detected his disappointment in his manner, albeit his\nsentences were short and incomplete. But the Colonel's colloquial\nspeech was apt to be fragmentary incoherencies of his larger\noratorical utterances.\n\n\"A thousand pardons--for--er--having kept a lady waiting--er!\nBut--er--congratulations of friends--and--er--courtesy due to\nthem--er--interfered with--though perhaps only heightened--by\nprocrastination--pleasure of--ha!\" And the Colonel completed his\nsentence with a gallant wave of his fat but white and well-kept hand.\n\n\"Yes! I came to see you along o' that speech of yours. I was in court.\nWhen I heard you gettin' it off on that jury, I says to myself that's\nthe kind o' lawyer _I_ want. A man that's flowery and convincin'! Just\nthe man to take up our case.\"\n\n\"Ah! It's a matter of business, I see,\" said the Colonel, inwardly\nrelieved, but externally careless. \"And--er--may I ask the nature of\nthe case?\"\n\n\"Well! it's a breach-o'-promise suit,\" said the visitor, calmly.\n\nIf the Colonel had been surprised before, he was now really startled,\nand with an added horror that required all his politeness to conceal.\nBreach-of-promise cases were his peculiar aversion. He had always held\nthem to be a kind of litigation which could have been obviated by the\nprompt killing of the masculine offender--in which case he would have\ngladly defended the killer. But a suit for damages!--_damages!_--with\nthe reading of love-letters before a hilarious jury and court, was\nagainst all his instincts. His chivalry was outraged; his sense of\nhumor was small--and in the course of his career he had lost one or\ntwo important cases through an unexpected development of this quality\nin a jury.\n\nThe woman had evidently noticed his hesitation, but mistook its cause.\n\"It ain't me--but my darter.\"\n\nThe Colonel recovered his politeness. \"Ah! I am relieved, my dear\nmadam! I could hardly conceive a man ignorant enough to--er--er--throw\naway such evident good fortune--or base enough to deceive the\ntrustfulness of womanhood--matured and experienced only in the\nchivalry of our sex, ha!\"\n\nThe woman smiled grimly. \"Yes!--it's my darter, Zaidee Hooker--so ye\nmight spare some of them pretty speeches for _her_--before the jury.\"\n\nThe Colonel winced slightly before this doubtful prospect, but\nsmiled. \"Ha! Yes!--certainly--the jury. But--er--my dear lady, need\nwe go as far as that? Cannot this affair be settled--er--out of\ncourt? Could not this--er--individual--be admonished--told that he\nmust give satisfaction--personal satisfaction--for his dastardly\nconduct--to --er--near relative--or even valued personal friend?\nThe--er--arrangements necessary for that purpose I myself would\nundertake.\"\n\nHe was quite sincere; indeed, his small black eyes shone with that\nfire which a pretty woman or an \"affair of honor\" could alone kindle.\nThe visitor stared vacantly at him, and said, slowly:\n\n\"And what good is that goin' to do _us_?\"\n\n\"Compel him to--er--perform his promise,\" said the Colonel, leaning\nback in his chair.\n\n\"Ketch him doin' it!\" said the woman, scornfully. \"No--that ain't wot\nwe're after. We must make him _pay_! Damages--and nothin' short o'\n_that_.\"\n\nThe Colonel bit his lip. \"I suppose,\" he said, gloomily, \"you have\ndocumentary evidence--written promises and protestations--er--er--\nlove-letters, in fact?\"\n\n\"No--nary a letter! Ye see, that's jest it--and that's where _you_\ncome in. You've got to convince that jury yourself. You've got to show\nwhat it is--tell the whole story your own way. Lord! to a man like you\nthat's nothin'.\"\n\nStartling as this admission might have been to any other lawyer,\nStarbottle was absolutely relieved by it. The absence of any\nmirth-provoking correspondence, and the appeal solely to his own\npowers of persuasion, actually struck his fancy. He lightly put aside\nthe compliment with a wave of his white hand.\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Colonel, confidently, \"there is strongly\npresumptive and corroborative evidence? Perhaps you can give me--er--a\nbrief outline of the affair?\"\n\n\"Zaidee kin do that straight enough, I reckon,\" said the woman; \"what\nI want to know first is, kin you take the case?\"\n\nThe Colonel did not hesitate; his curiosity was piqued. \"I certainly\ncan. I have no doubt your daughter will put me in possession of\nsufficient facts and details--to constitute what we call--er--a\nbrief.\"\n\n\"She kin be brief enough--or long enough--for the matter of that,\"\nsaid the woman, rising. The Colonel accepted this implied witticism\nwith a smile.\n\n\"And when may I have the pleasure of seeing her?\" he asked, politely.\n\n\"Well, I reckon as soon as I can trot out and call her. She's just\noutside, meanderin' in the road--kinder shy, ye know, at first.\"\n\nShe walked to the door. The astounded Colonel nevertheless gallantly\naccompanied her as she stepped out into the street and called,\nshrilly, \"You Zaidee!\"\n\nA young girl here apparently detached herself from a tree and the\nostentatious perusal of an old election poster, and sauntered down\ntowards the office door. Like her mother, she was plainly dressed;\nunlike her, she had a pale, rather refined face, with a demure mouth\nand downcast eyes. This was all the Colonel saw as he bowed profoundly\nand led the way into his office, for she accepted his salutations\nwithout lifting her head. He helped her gallantly to a chair, on which\nshe seated herself sideways, somewhat ceremoniously, with her eyes\nfollowing the point of her parasol as she traced a pattern on the\ncarpet. A second chair offered to the mother that lady, however,\ndeclined. \"I reckon to leave you and Zaidee together to talk it out,\"\nshe said; turning to her daughter, she added, \"Jest you tell him all,\nZaidee,\" and before the Colonel could rise again, disappeared from the\nroom. In spite of his professional experience, Starbottle was for a\nmoment embarrassed. The young girl, however, broke the silence without\nlooking up.\n\n\"Adoniram K. Hotchkiss,\" she began, in a monotonous voice, as if it\nwere a recitation addressed to the public, \"first began to take notice\nof me a year ago. Arter that--off and on----\"\n\n\"One moment,\" interrupted the astounded Colonel; \"do you mean\nHotchkiss the President of the Ditch Company?\" He had recognized the\nname of a prominent citizen--a rigid ascetic, taciturn, middle-aged\nman--a deacon--and more than that, the head of the company he had just\ndefended. It seemed inconceivable.\n\n\"That's him,\" she continued, with eyes still fixed on the parasol and\nwithout changing her monotonous tone--\"off and on ever since. Most of\nthe time at the Free-Will Baptist church--at morning service,\nprayer-meetings, and such. And at home--outside--er--in the road.\"\n\n\"Is it this gentleman--Mr. Adoniram K. Hotchkiss--who--er--promised\nmarriage?\" stammered the Colonel.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe Colonel shifted uneasily in his chair. \"Most extraordinary!\nfor--you see--my dear young lady--this becomes--a--er--most delicate\naffair.\"\n\n\"That's what maw said,\" returned the young woman, simply, yet with the\nfaintest smile playing around her demure lips and downcast cheek.\n\n\"I mean,\" said the Colonel, with a pained yet courteous smile, \"that\nthis--er--gentleman--is in fact--er--one of my clients.\"\n\n\"That's what maw said, too, and of course your knowing him will make\nit all the easier for you,\" said the young woman.\n\nA slight flush crossed the Colonel's cheek as he returned quickly and\na little stiffly, \"On the contrary--er--it may make it impossible for\nme to--er--act in this matter.\"\n\nThe girl lifted her eyes. The Colonel held his breath as the long\nlashes were raised to his level. Even to an ordinary observer that\nsudden revelation of her eyes seemed to transform her face with subtle\nwitchery. They were large, brown, and soft, yet filled with an\nextraordinary penetration and prescience. They were the eyes of an\nexperienced woman of thirty fixed in the face of a child. What else\nthe Colonel saw there Heaven only knows! He felt his inmost secrets\nplucked from him--his whole soul laid bare--his vanity, belligerency,\ngallantry--even his medieval chivalry, penetrated, and yet\nilluminated, in that single glance. And when the eyelids fell again,\nhe felt that a greater part of himself had been swallowed up in them.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, hurriedly. \"I mean--this matter may be\narranged--er--amicably. My interest with--and as you wisely\nsay--my--er--knowledge of my client--er--Mr. Hotchkiss--may affect--a\ncompromise.\"\n\n\"And _damages_,\" said the young girl, readdressing her parasol, as if\nshe had never looked up.\n\nThe Colonel winced. \"And--er--undoubtedly _compensation_--if you do\nnot press a fulfilment of the promise. Unless,\" he said, with an\nattempted return to his former easy gallantry, which, however, the\nrecollection of her eyes made difficult, \"it is a question of--er--the\naffections?\"\n\n\"Which?\" said his fair client, softly.\n\n\"If you still love him?\" explained the Colonel, actually blushing.\n\nZaidee again looked up; again taking the Colonel's breath away with\neyes that expressed not only the fullest perception of what he had\n_said_, but of what he thought and had not said, and with an added\nsubtle suggestion of what he might have thought. \"That's tellin',\" she\nsaid, dropping her long lashes again. The Colonel laughed vacantly.\nThen feeling himself growing imbecile, he forced an equally weak\ngravity. \"Pardon me--I understand there are no letters; may I know the\nway in which he formulated his declaration and promises?\"\n\n\"Hymn-books,\" said the girl, briefly.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the mystified lawyer.\n\n\"Hymn-books--marked words in them with pencil--and passed 'em on to\nme,\" repeated Zaidee. \"Like 'love,' 'dear,' 'precious,' 'sweet,' and\n'blessed,'\" she added, accenting each word with a push of her parasol\non the carpet. \"Sometimes a whole line outer Tate and Brady--and\n_Solomon's Song_, you know, and sich.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" said the Colonel, loftily, \"that the--er--phrases of\nsacred psalmody lend themselves to the language of the affections. But\nin regard to the distinct promise of marriage--was there--er--no\n_other_ expression?\"\n\n\"Marriage Service in the prayer-book--lines and words outer that--all\nmarked,\" said Zaidee. The Colonel nodded naturally and approvingly.\n\"Very good. Were others cognizant of this? Were there any witnesses?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the girl. \"Only me and him. It was generally at\nchurch-time--or prayer-meeting. Once, in passing the plate, he slipped\none o' them peppermint lozenges with the letters stamped on it 'I love\nyou' for me to take.\"\n\nThe Colonel coughed slightly. \"And you have the lozenge?\"\n\n\"I ate it,\" said the girl, simply.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Colonel. After a pause he added, delicately:\n\"But were these attentions--er--confined to--er---sacred precincts?\nDid he meet you elsewhere?\"\n\n\"Useter pass our house on the road,\" returned the girl, dropping into\nher monotonous recital, \"and useter signal.\"\n\n\"Ah, signal?\" repeated the Colonel, approvingly.\n\n\"Yes! He'd say 'Kerrow,' and I'd say 'Kerree.' Suthing like a bird,\nyou know.\"\n\nIndeed, as she lifted her voice in imitation of the call the Colonel\nthought it certainly very sweet and birdlike. At least as _she_ gave\nit. With his remembrance of the grim deacon he had doubts as to the\nmelodiousness of _his_ utterance. He gravely made her repeat it.\n\n\"And after that signal?\" he added, suggestively.\n\n\"He'd pass on,\" said the girl.\n\nThe Colonel coughed slightly, and tapped his desk with his pen-holder.\n\n\"Were there any endearments--er--caresses--er--such as taking your\nhand--er--clasping your waist?\" he suggested, with a gallant yet\nrespectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head;--\"er--\nslight pressure of your fingers in the changes of a dance--I mean,\"\nhe corrected himself, with an apologetic cough--\"in the passing of\nthe plate?\"\n\n\"No;--he was not what you'd call 'fond,'\" returned the girl.\n\n\"Ah! Adoniram K. Hotchkiss was not 'fond' in the ordinary acceptance\nof the word,\" said the Colonel, with professional gravity.\n\nShe lifted her disturbing eyes, and again absorbed his in her own. She\nalso said \"Yes,\" although her eyes in their mysterious prescience of\nall he was thinking disclaimed the necessity of any answer at all. He\nsmiled vacantly. There was a long pause. On which she slowly\ndisengaged her parasol from the carpet pattern and stood up.\n\n\"I reckon that's about all,\" she said.\n\n\"Er--yes--but one moment,\" said the Colonel, vaguely. He would have\nliked to keep her longer, but with her strange premonition of him he\nfelt powerless to detain her, or explain his reason for doing so. He\ninstinctively knew she had told him all; his professional judgment\ntold him that a more hopeless case had never come to his knowledge.\nYet he was not daunted, only embarrassed. \"No matter,\" he said,\nvaguely. \"Of course I shall have to consult with you again.\" Her eyes\nagain answered that she expected he would, but she added, simply,\n\"When?\"\n\n\"In the course of a day or two,\" said the Colonel, quickly. \"I will\nsend you word.\" She turned to go. In his eagerness to open the door\nfor her he upset his chair, and with some confusion, that was actually\nyouthful, he almost impeded her movements in the hall, and knocked his\nbroad-brimmed Panama hat from his bowing hand in a final gallant\nsweep. Yet as her small, trim, youthful figure, with its simple\nLeghorn straw hat confined by a blue bow under her round chin, passed\naway before him, she looked more like a child than ever.\n\nThe Colonel spent that afternoon in making diplomatic inquiries. He\nfound his youthful client was the daughter of a widow who had a small\nranch on the cross-roads, near the new Free-Will Baptist church--the\nevident theatre of this pastoral. They led a secluded life; the girl\nbeing little known in the town, and her beauty and fascination\napparently not yet being a recognized fact. The Colonel felt a\npleasurable relief at this, and a general satisfaction he could not\naccount for. His few inquiries concerning Mr. Hotchkiss only confirmed\nhis own impressions of the alleged lover--a serious-minded,\npractically abstracted man--abstentive of youthful society, and the\nlast man apparently capable of levity of the affections or serious\nflirtation. The Colonel was mystified--but determined of\npurpose--whatever that purpose might have been.\n\nThe next day he was at his office at the same hour. He was alone--as\nusual--the Colonel's office really being his private lodgings,\ndisposed in connecting rooms, a single apartment reserved for\nconsultation. He had no clerk; his papers and briefs being taken by\nhis faithful body-servant and ex-slave \"Jim\" to another firm who did\nhis office-work since the death of Major Stryker--the Colonel's only\nlaw partner, who fell in a duel some years previous. With a fine\nconstancy the Colonel still retained his partner's name on his\ndoor-plate--and, it was alleged by the superstitious, kept a certain\ninvincibility also through the _manes_ of that lamented and somewhat\nfeared man.\n\nThe Colonel consulted his watch, whose heavy gold case still showed\nthe marks of a providential interference with a bullet destined for\nits owner, and replaced it with some difficulty and shortness of\nbreath in his fob. At the same moment he heard a step in the passage,\nand the door opened to Adoniram K. Hotchkiss. The Colonel was\nimpressed; he had a duellist's respect for punctuality.\n\nThe man entered with a nod and the expectant, inquiring look of a busy\nman. As his feet crossed that sacred threshold the Colonel became all\ncourtesy; he placed a chair for his visitor, and took his hat from his\nhalf-reluctant hand. He then opened a cupboard and brought out a\nbottle of whiskey and two glasses.\n\n\"A--er--slight refreshment, Mr. Hotchkiss,\" he suggested, politely. \"I\nnever drink,\" replied Hotchkiss, with the severe attitude of a total\nabstainer. \"Ah--er--not the finest bourbon whiskey, selected by a\nKentucky friend? No? Pardon me! A cigar, then--the mildest Havana.\"\n\n\"I do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form,\" repeated Hotchkiss,\nascetically. \"I have no foolish weaknesses.\"\n\nThe Colonel's moist, beady eyes swept silently over his client's\nsallow face. He leaned back comfortably in his chair, and half\nclosing his eyes as in dreamy reminiscence, said, slowly: \"Your\nreply, Mr. Hotchkiss, reminds me of--er--sing'lar circumstances that\n--er--occurred, in point of fact--at the St. Charles Hotel, New\nOrleans. Pinkey Hornblower--personal friend--invited Senator\nDoolittle to join him in social glass. Received, sing'larly enough,\nreply similar to yours. 'Don't drink nor smoke?' said Pinkey. 'Gad,\nsir, you must be mighty sweet on the ladies.' Ha!\" The Colonel paused\nlong enough to allow the faint flush to pass from Hotchkiss's cheek,\nand went on, half closing his eyes: \"'I allow no man, sir, to discuss\nmy personal habits,' said Doolittle, over his shirt collar. 'Then I\nreckon shootin' must be one of those habits,' said Pinkey, coolly.\nBoth men drove out on the Shell Road back of cemetery next morning.\nPinkey put bullet at twelve paces through Doolittle's temple. Poor\nDoo never spoke again. Left three wives and seven children, they say\n--two of 'em black.\"\n\n\"I got a note from you this morning,\" said Hotchkiss, with badly\nconcealed impatience. \"I suppose in reference to our case. You have\ntaken judgment, I believe.\" The Colonel, without replying, slowly\nfilled a glass of whiskey and water. For a moment he held it dreamily\nbefore him, as if still engaged in gentle reminiscences called up by\nthe act. Then tossing it off, he wiped his lips with a large white\nhandkerchief, and leaning back comfortably in his chair, said, with a\nwave of his hand, \"The interview I requested, Mr. Hotchkiss, concerns\na subject--which I may say is--er--er--at present _not_ of a public\nor business nature--although _later_ it might become--er--er--both.\nIt is an affair of some--er--delicacy.\"\n\nThe Colonel paused, and Mr. Hotchkiss regarded him with increased\nimpatience. The Colonel, however, continued, with unchanged\ndeliberation: \"It concerns--er--a young lady--a beautiful,\nhigh-souled creature, sir, who, apart from her personal loveliness--\ner--er--I may say is of one of the first families of Missouri, and--\ner--not--remotely connected by marriage with one of--er--er--my\nboyhood's dearest friends. The latter, I grieve to say, was a pure\ninvention of the Colonel's--an oratorical addition to the scanty\ninformation he had obtained the previous day. The young lady,\" he\ncontinued, blandly, \"enjoys the further distinction of being the\nobject of such attention from you as would make this interview--\nreally--a confidential matter--er--er--among friends and--er--er--\nrelations in present and future. I need not say that the lady I refer\nto is Miss Zaidee Juno Hooker, only daughter of Almira Ann Hooker,\nrelict of Jefferson Brown Hooker, formerly of Boone County, Kentucky,\nand latterly of--er--Pike County, Missouri.\"\n\nThe sallow, ascetic hue of Mr. Hotchkiss's face had passed through a\nlivid and then a greenish shade, and finally settled into a sullen\nred. \"What's all this about?\" he demanded, roughly. The least touch of\nbelligerent fire came into Starbottle's eye, but his bland courtesy\ndid not change. \"I believe,\" he said, politely, \"I have made myself\nclear as between--er--gentlemen, though perhaps not as clear as I\nshould to--er--er--jury.\"\n\nMr. Hotchkiss was apparently struck with some significance in the\nlawyer's reply. \"I don't know,\" he said, in a lower and more cautious\nvoice, \"what you mean by what you call 'my attentions' to--any one--or\nhow it concerns you. I have not exhausted half a dozen words with--the\nperson you name--have never written her a line--nor even called at her\nhouse.\" He rose with an assumption of ease, pulled down his waistcoat,\nbuttoned his coat, and took up his hat. The Colonel did not move. \"I\nbelieve I have already indicated my meaning in what I have called\n'your attentions,'\" said the Colonel, blandly, \"and given you my\n'concern' for speaking as--er--er mutual friend. As to _your_\nstatement of your relations with Miss Hooker, I may state that it is\nfully corroborated by the statement of the young lady herself in this\nvery office yesterday.\"\n\n\"Then what does this impertinent nonsense mean? Why am I summoned\nhere?\" said Hotchkiss, furiously.\n\n\"Because,\" said the Colonel, deliberately, \"that statement is\ninfamously--yes, damnably to your discredit, sir!\"\n\nMr. Hotchkiss was here seized by one of those important and\ninconsistent rages which occasionally betray the habitually cautious\nand timid man. He caught up the Colonel's stick, which was lying on\nthe table. At the same moment the Colonel, without any apparent\neffort, grasped it by the handle. To Mr. Hotchkiss's astonishment, the\nstick separated in two pieces, leaving the handle and about two feet\nof narrow glittering steel in the Colonel's hand. The man recoiled,\ndropping the useless fragment. The Colonel picked it up, fitting the\nshining blade in it, clicked the spring, and then rising, with a face\nof courtesy yet of unmistakably genuine pain, and with even a slight\ntremor in his voice, said, gravely:\n\n\"Mr. Hotchkiss, I owe you a thousand apologies, sir, that--er--\na weapon should be drawn by me--even through your own inadvertence--\nunder the sacred protection of my roof, and upon an unarmed man. I\nbeg your pardon, sir, and I even withdraw the expressions which\nprovoked that inadvertence. Nor does this apology prevent you from\nholding me responsible--personally responsible--_elsewhere_ for an\nindiscretion committed in behalf of a lady--my--er--client.\"\n\n\"Your client? Do you mean you have taken her case? You, the counsel\nfor the Ditch Company?\" said Mr. Hotchkiss, in trembling indignation.\n\n\"Having won _your_ case, sir,\" said the Colonel, coolly,\n\"the--er--usages of advocacy do not prevent me from espousing the\ncause of the weak and unprotected.\"\n\n\"We shall see, sir,\" said Hotchkiss, grasping the handle of the door\nand backing into the passage. \"There are other lawyers who--\"\n\n\"Permit me to see you out,\" interrupted the Colonel, rising politely.\n\n\"--will be ready to resist the attacks of blackmail,\" continued\nHotchkiss, retreating along the passage.\n\n\"And then you will be able to repeat your remarks to me _in the\nstreet_,\" continued the Colonel, bowing, as he persisted in following\nhis visitor to the door.\n\nBut here Mr. Hotchkiss quickly slammed it behind him, and hurried\naway. The Colonel returned to his office, and sitting down, took a\nsheet of letter paper bearing the inscription \"Starbottle and Stryker,\nAttorneys and Counsellors,\" and wrote the following lines:\n\n  Hooker _versus_ Hotchkiss.\n\n  DEAR MADAM,--Having had a visit from the defendant in\n  above, we should be pleased to have an interview with you at\n  2 p.m. to-morrow. Your obedient servants,\n                                            STARBOTTLE AND STRYKER.\n\nThis he sealed and despatched by his trusted servant Jim, and then\ndevoted a few moments to reflection. It was the custom of the Colonel\nto act first, and justify the action by reason afterwards.\n\nHe knew that Hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival\ncounsel. He knew that they would advise him that Miss Hooker had \"no\ncase\"--that she would be non-suited on her own evidence, and he ought\nnot to compromise, but be ready to stand trial. He believed, however,\nthat Hotchkiss feared that exposure, and although his own instincts\nhad been at first against that remedy, he was now instinctively in\nfavor of it. He remembered his own power with a jury; his vanity and\nhis chivalry alike approved of this heroic method; he was bound by the\nprosaic facts--he had his own theory of the case, which no mere\nevidence could gainsay. In fact, Mrs. Hooker's own words that \"he was\nto tell the story in his own way\" actually appeared to him an\ninspiration and a prophecy.\n\nPerhaps there was something else, due possibly to the lady's wonderful\neyes, of which he had thought much. Yet it was not her simplicity that\naffected him solely; on the contrary, it was her apparent intelligent\nreading of the character of her recreant lover--and of his own! Of all\nthe Colonel's previous \"light\" or \"serious\" loves none had ever before\nflattered him in that way. And it was this, combined with the respect\nwhich he had held for their professional relations, that precluded his\nhaving a more familiar knowledge of his client, through serious\nquestioning, or playful gallantry. I am not sure it was not part of\nthe charm to have a rustic _femme incomprise_ as a client.\n\nNothing could exceed the respect with which he greeted her as she\nentered his office the next day. He even affected not to notice that\nshe had put on her best clothes, and he made no doubt appeared as when\nshe had first attracted the mature yet faithless attentions of Deacon\nHotchkiss at church. A white virginal muslin was belted around her\nslim figure by a blue ribbon, and her Leghorn hat was drawn around her\noval cheek by a bow of the same color. She had a Southern girl's\nnarrow feet, encased in white stockings and kid slippers, which were\ncrossed primly before her as she sat in a chair, supporting her arm by\nher faithful parasol planted firmly on the floor. A faint odor of\nsouthernwood exhaled from her, and, oddly enough, stirred the Colonel\nwith a far-off recollection of a pine-shaded Sunday school on a\nGeorgia hillside and of his first love, aged ten, in a short, starched\nfrock. Possibly it was the same recollection that revived something of\nthe awkwardness he had felt then.\n\nHe, however, smiled vaguely and, sitting down, coughed slightly, and\nplaced his fingertips together. \"I have had an--er--interview with Mr.\nHotchkiss, but--I--er--regret to say there seems to be no prospect\nof--er--compromise.\" He paused, and to his surprise her listless\n\"company\" face lit up with an adorable smile. \"Of course!--ketch him!\"\nshe said. \"Was he mad when you told him?\" She put her knees\ncomfortably together and leaned forward for a reply.\n\nFor all that, wild horses could not have torn from the Colonel a word\nabout Hotchkiss's anger. \"He expressed his intention of employing\ncounsel--and defending a suit,\" returned the Colonel, affably basking\nin her smile. She dragged her chair nearer his desk. \"Then you'll\nfight him tooth and nail?\" she said eagerly; \"you'll show him up?\nYou'll tell the whole story your own way? You'll give him fits?--and\nyou'll make him pay? Sure?\" she went on, breathlessly.\n\n\"I--er--will,\" said the Colonel, almost as breathlessly.\n\nShe caught his fat white hand, which was lying on the table, between\nher own and lifted it to her lips. He felt her soft young fingers even\nthrough the lisle-thread gloves that encased them and the warm\nmoisture of her lips upon his skin. He felt himself flushing--but was\nunable to break the silence or change his position. The next moment\nshe had scuttled back with her chair to her old position.\n\n\"I--er--certainly shall do my best,\" stammered the Colonel, in an\nattempt to recover his dignity and composure.\n\n\"That's enough! You'll _do_ it,\" said the girl, enthusiastically.\n\"Lordy! Just you talk for _me_ as ye did for _his_ old Ditch Company,\nand you'll fetch it--every time! Why, when you made that jury sit up\nthe other day--when you got that off about the Merrikan flag waving\nequally over the rights of honest citizens banded together in peaceful\ncommercial pursuits, as well as over the fortress of official\nproflig--\"\n\n\"Oligarchy,\" murmured the Colonel, courteously.\n\n\"Oligarchy,\" repeated the girl, quickly, \"my breath was just took\naway. I said to maw, 'Ain't he too sweet for anything!' I did, honest\nInjin! And when you rolled it all off at the end--never missing a\nword--(you didn't need to mark 'em in a lesson-book, but had 'em all\nready on your tongue), and walked out--Well! I didn't know you nor the\nDitch Company from Adam, but I could have just run over and kissed you\nthere before the whole court!\"\n\nShe laughed, with her face glowing, although her strange eyes were\ncast down. Alack! the Colonel's face was equally flushed, and his own\nbeady eyes were on his desk. To any other woman he would have voiced\nthe banal gallantry that he should now, himself, look forward to that\nreward, but the words never reached his lips. He laughed, coughed\nslightly, and when he looked up again she had fallen into the same\nattitude as on her first visit, with her parasol point on the floor.\n\n\"I must ask you to--er--direct your memory--to--er--another point; the\nbreaking off of the--er--er--er--engagement. Did he--er--give any\nreason for it? Or show any cause?\"\n\n\"No; he never said anything,\" returned the girl.\n\n\"Not in his usual way?--er--no reproaches out of the hymn-book?--or\nthe sacred writings?\"\n\n\"No; he just _quit_.\"\n\n\"Er--ceased his attentions,\" said the Colonel, gravely. \"And naturally\nyou--er--were not conscious of any cause for his doing so.\" The girl\nraised her wonderful eyes so suddenly and so penetratingly without\nreply in any other way that the Colonel could only hurriedly say: \"I\nsee! None, of course!\"\n\nAt which she rose, the Colonel rising also. \"We--shall begin\nproceedings at once. I must, however, caution you to answer no\nquestions nor say anything about this case to any one until you are in\ncourt.\"\n\nShe answered his request with another intelligent look and a nod. He\naccompanied her to the door. As he took her proffered hand he raised\nthe lisle-thread fingers to his lips with old-fashioned gallantry. As\nif that act had condoned for his first omissions and awkwardness, he\nbecame his old-fashioned self again, buttoned his coat, pulled out his\nshirt frill, and strutted back to his desk.\n\nA day or two later it was known throughout the town that Zaidee Hooker\nhad sued Adoniram Hotchkiss for breach of promise, and that the\ndamages were laid at five thousand dollars. As in those bucolic days\nthe Western press was under the secure censorship of a revolver, a\ncautious tone of criticism prevailed, and any gossip was confined to\npersonal expression, and even then at the risk of the gossiper.\nNevertheless, the situation provoked the intensest curiosity. The\nColonel was approached--until his statement that he should consider\nany attempt to overcome his professional secrecy a personal reflection\nwithheld further advances. The community were left to the more\nostentatious information of the defendant's counsel, Messrs. Kitcham\nand Bilser, that the case was \"ridiculous\" and \"rotten,\" that the\nplaintiff would be nonsuited, and the fire-eating Starbottle would be\ntaught a lesson that he could not \"bully\" the law--and there were some\ndark hints of a conspiracy. It was even hinted that the \"case\" was the\nrevengeful and preposterous outcome of the refusal of Hotchkiss to pay\nStarbottle an extravagant fee for his late services to the Ditch\nCompany. It is unnecessary to say that these words were not reported\nto the Colonel. It was, however, an unfortunate circumstance for the\ncalmer, ethical consideration of the subject that the church sided\nwith Hotchkiss, as this provoked an equal adherence to the plaintiff\nand Starbottle on the part of the larger body of non-church-goers, who\nwere delighted at a possible exposure of the weakness of religious\nrectitude. \"I've allus had my suspicions o' them early candle-light\nmeetings down at that gospel shop,\" said one critic, \"and I reckon\nDeacon Hotchkiss didn't rope in the gals to attend jest for\npsalm-singing.\" \"Then for him to get up and leave the board afore the\ngame's finished and try to sneak out of it,\" said another. \"I suppose\nthat's what they call _religious_.\"\n\nIt was therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three weeks later\nwas crowded with an excited multitude of the curious and sympathizing.\nThe fair plaintiff, with her mother, was early in attendance, and\nunder the Colonel's advice appeared in the same modest garb in which\nshe had first visited his office. This and her downcast modest\ndemeanor were perhaps at first disappointing to the crowd, who had\nevidently expected a paragon of loveliness--as the Circe of the grim\nascetic defendant, who sat beside his counsel. But presently all eyes\nwere fixed on the Colonel, who certainly made up in _his_ appearance\nany deficiency of his fair client. His portly figure was clothed in a\nblue dress-coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat which permitted\nhis frilled shirt front to become erectile above it, a black satin\nstock which confined a boyish turned-down collar around his full neck,\nand immaculate drill trousers, strapped over varnished boots. A murmur\nran round the court. \"Old 'Personally Responsible' had got his\nwar-paint on,\" \"The Old War-Horse is smelling powder,\" were whispered\ncomments. Yet for all that the most irreverent among them recognized\nvaguely, in this bizarre figure, something of an honored past in their\ncountry's history, and possibly felt the spell of old deeds and old\nnames that had once thrilled their boyish pulses. The new District\nJudge returned Colonel Starbottle's profoundly punctilious bow. The\nColonel was followed by his negro servant, carrying a parcel of\nhymn-books and Bibles, who, with a courtesy evidently imitated from\nhis master, placed one before the opposite counsel. This, after a\nfirst curious glance, the lawyer somewhat superciliously tossed aside.\nBut when Jim, proceeding to the jury-box, placed with equal politeness\nthe remaining copies before the jury, the opposite counsel sprang to\nhis feet.\n\n\"I want to direct the attention of the Court to this unprecedented\ntampering with the jury, by this gratuitous exhibition of matter\nimpertinent and irrelevant to the issue.\"\n\nThe Judge cast an inquiring look at Colonel Starbottle.\n\n\"May it please the Court,\" returned Colonel Starbottle with dignity,\nignoring the counsel, \"the defendant's counsel will observe that he is\nalready furnished with the matter--which I regret to say he has\ntreated--in the presence of the Court--and of his client, a deacon of\nthe church--with--er---great superciliousness. When I state to your\nHonor that the books in question are hymn-books and copies of the\n_Holy Scriptures_, and that they are for the instruction of the jury,\nto whom I shall have to refer them in the course of my opening, I\nbelieve I am within my rights.\"\n\n\"The act is certainly unprecedented,\" said the Judge, dryly, \"but\nunless the counsel for the plaintiff expects the jury to _sing_ from\nthese hymn-books, their introduction is not improper, and I cannot\nadmit the objection. As defendant's counsel are furnished with copies\nalso, they cannot plead 'surprise,' as in the introduction of new\nmatter, and as plaintiff's counsel relies evidently upon the jury's\nattention to his opening, he would not be the first person to distract\nit.\" After a pause he added, addressing the Colonel, who remained\nstanding, \"The Court is with you, sir; proceed.\"\n\nBut the Colonel remained motionless and statuesque, with folded arms.\n\n\"I have overruled the objection,\" repeated the Judge; \"you may go on.\"\n\n\"I am waiting, your Honor, for the--er--withdrawal by the defendant's\ncounsel of the word 'tampering,' as refers to myself, and of\n'impertinent,' as refers to the sacred volumes.\"\n\n\"The request is a proper one, and I have no doubt will be acceded to,\"\nreturned the Judge, quietly. The defendant's counsel rose and mumbled\na few words of apology, and the incident closed. There was, however, a\ngeneral feeling that the Colonel had in some way \"scored,\" and if his\nobject had been to excite the greatest curiosity about the books, he\nhad made his point.\n\nBut impassive of his victory, he inflated his chest, with his right\nhand in the breast of his buttoned coat, and began. His usual high\ncolor had paled slightly, but the small pupils of his prominent eyes\nglittered like steel. The young girl leaned forward in her chair with\nan attention so breathless, a sympathy so quick, and an admiration so\nartless and unconscious that in an instant she divided with the\nspeaker the attention of the whole assemblage. It was very hot; the\ncourt was crowded to suffocation; even the open windows revealed a\ncrowd of faces outside the building, eagerly following the Colonel's\nwords.\n\nHe would remind the jury that only a few weeks ago he stood there as\nthe advocate of a powerful company, then represented by the present\ndefendant. He spoke then as the champion of strict justice against\nlegal oppression; no less should he to-day champion the cause of the\nunprotected and the comparatively defenseless--save for that paramount\npower which surrounds beauty and innocence--even though the plaintiff\nof yesterday was the defendant of to-day. As he approached the court a\nmoment ago he had raised his eyes and beheld the starry flag flying\nfrom its dome--and he knew that glorious banner was a symbol of the\nperfect equality, under the Constitution, of the rich and the poor,\nthe strong and the weak--an equality which made the simple citizen\ntaken from the plough in the veld, the pick in the gulch, or from\nbehind the counter in the mining town, who served on that jury, the\nequal arbiters of justice with that highest legal luminary whom they\nwere proud to welcome on the bench to-day. The Colonel paused, with a\nstately bow to the impassive Judge. It was this, he continued, which\nlifted his heart as he approached the building. And yet--he had\nentered it with an uncertain--he might almost say--a timid step. And\nwhy? He knew, gentlemen, he was about to confront a profound--aye! a\nsacred responsibility! Those hymn-books and holy writings handed to\nthe jury were _not_, as his Honor surmised, for the purpose of\nenabling the jury to indulge in--er--preliminary choral exercise! He\nmight, indeed, say \"alas not!\" They were the damning, incontrovertible\nproofs of the perfidy of the defendant. And they would prove as\nterrible a warning to him as the fatal characters upon Belshazzar's\nwall. There was a strong sensation. Hotchkiss turned a sallow green.\nHis lawyers assumed a careless smile.\n\nIt was his duty to tell them that this was not one of those ordinary\n\"breach-of-promise\" cases which were too often the occasion of\nruthless mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom. The jury would\nfind nothing of that here, There were no love-letters with the\nepithets of endearment, nor those mystic crosses and ciphers which, he\nhad been credibly informed, chastely hid the exchange of those mutual\ncaresses known as \"kisses.\" There was no cruel tearing of the veil\nfrom those sacred privacies of the human affection--there was no\nforensic shouting out of those fond confidences meant only for _one_.\nBut there was, he was shocked to say, a new sacrilegious intrusion.\nThe weak pipings of Cupid were mingled with the chorus of the\nsaints--the sanctity of the temple known as the \"meeting-house\" was\ndesecrated by proceedings more in keeping with the shrine of\nVenus--and the inspired writings themselves were used as the medium of\namatory and wanton flirtation by the defendant in his sacred capacity\nas Deacon.\n\nThe Colonel artistically paused after this thunderous denunciation.\nThe jury turned eagerly to the leaves of the hymn-books, but the\nlarger gaze of the audience remained fixed upon the speaker and the\ngirl, who sat in rapt admiration of his periods. After the hush, the\nColonel continued in a lower and sadder voice: \"There are, perhaps,\nfew of us here, gentlemen--with the exception of the defendant--who\ncan arrogate to themselves the title of regular churchgoers, or to\nwhom these humbler functions of the prayer-meeting, the Sunday-school,\nand the Bible class are habitually familiar. Yet\"--more\nsolemnly--\"down in your hearts is the deep conviction of our\nshort-comings and failings, and a laudable desire that others at least\nshould profit by the teachings we neglect. Perhaps,\" he continued,\nclosing his eyes dreamily, \"there is not a man here who does not\nrecall the happy days of his boyhood, the rustic village spire, the\nlessons shared with some artless village maiden, with whom he later\nsauntered, hand in hand, through the woods, as the simple rhyme rose\nupon their lips,\n\n  Always make it a point to have it a rule\n  Never to be late at the Sabbath-school.\"\n\nHe would recall the strawberry feasts, the welcome annual picnic,\nredolent with hunks of gingerbread and sarsaparilla. How would they\nfeel to know that these sacred recollections were now forever profaned\nin their memory by the knowledge that the defendant was capable of\nusing such occasions to make love to the larger girls and teachers,\nwhilst his artless companions were innocently--the Court will pardon\nme for introducing what I am credibly informed is the local expression\n'doing gooseberry'?\" The tremulous flicker of a smile passed over the\nfaces of the listening crowd, and the Colonel slightly winced. But he\nrecovered himself instantly, and continued:\n\n\"My client, the only daughter of a widowed mother--who has for years\nstemmed the varying tides of adversity--in the western precincts of\nthis town--stands before you today invested only in her own innocence.\nShe wears no--er--rich gifts of her faithless admirer--is panoplied in\nno jewels, rings, nor mementoes of affection such as lovers delight to\nhang upon the shrine of their affections; hers is not the glory with\nwhich Solomon decorated the Queen of Sheba, though the defendant, as I\nshall show later, clothed her in the less expensive flowers of the\nking's poetry. No! gentlemen! The defendant exhibited in this affair a\ncertain frugality of--er--pecuniary investment, which I am willing to\nadmit may be commendable in his class. His only gift was\ncharacteristic alike of his methods and his economy. There is, I\nunderstand, a certain not unimportant feature of religious exercise\nknown as 'taking a collection.' The defendant, on this occasion, by\nthe mute presentation of a tip plate covered with baize, solicited the\npecuniary contributions of the faithful. On approaching the plaintiff,\nhowever, he himself slipped a love-token upon the plate and pushed it\ntowards her. That love-token was a lozenge--a small disk, I have\nreason to believe, concocted of peppermint and sugar, bearing upon its\nreverse surface the simple words, 'I love you!' I have since\nascertained that these disks may be bought for five cents a dozen--or\nat considerably less than one half-cent for the single lozenge. Yes,\ngentlemen, the words 'I love you!'--the oldest legend of all; the\nrefrain, 'when the morning stars sang together'--were presented to the\nplaintiff by a medium so insignificant that there is, happily, no coin\nin the republic low enough to represent its value.\n\n\"I shall prove to you, gentlemen of the jury,\" said the Colonel,\nsolemnly, drawing a _Bible_ from his coat-tail pocket, \"that the\ndefendant, for the last twelve months, conducted an amatory\ncorrespondence with the plaintiff by means of underlined words of\nsacred writ and church psalmody, such as 'beloved,' 'precious,' and\n'dearest,' occasionally appropriating whole passages which seemed\napposite to his tender passion. I shall call your attention to one of\nthem. The defendant, while professing to be a total abstainer--a man\nwho, in my own knowledge, has refused spirituous refreshment as an\ninordinate weakness of the flesh, with shameless hypocrisy underscores\nwith his pencil the following passage and presents it to the\nplaintiff. The gentlemen of the jury will find it in the _Song of\nSolomon_, page 548, chapter II, verse 5.\" After a pause, in which the\nrapid rustling of leaves was heard in the jury-box, Colonel\nStarbottle declaimed in a pleading, stentorian voice, \"'Stay me with\n--er--_flagons_, comfort me with--er--apples--for I am--er--sick of\nlove.' Yes, gentlemen!--yes, you may well turn from those accusing\npages and look at the double-faced defendant. He desires--to--er--be\n--'stayed with flagons'! I am not aware, at present, what kind of\nliquor is habitually dispensed at these meetings, and for which the\ndefendant so urgently clamored; but it will be my duty before this\ntrial is over to discover it, if I have to summon every barkeeper in\nthis district. For the moment, I will simply call your attention to\nthe _quantity_. It is not a single drink that the defendant asks for\n--not a glass of light and generous wine, to be shared with his\ninamorata--but a number of flagons or vessels, each possibly holding\na pint measure--_for himself_!\"\n\nThe smile of the audience had become a laugh. The Judge looked up\nwarningly, when his eye caught the fact that the Colonel had again\nwinced at this mirth. He regarded him seriously. Mr. Hotchkiss's\ncounsel had joined in the laugh affectedly, but Hotchkiss himself was\nashy pale. There was also a commotion in the jury-box, a hurried\nturning over of leaves, and an excited discussion.\n\n\"The gentlemen of the jury,\" said the Judge, with official gravity,\n\"will please keep order and attend only to the speeches of counsel.\nAny discussion _here_ is irregular and premature--and must be reserved\nfor the jury-room--after they have retired.\"\n\nThe foreman of the jury struggled to his feet. He was a powerful man,\nwith a good-humored face, and, in spite of his unfelicitous nickname\nof \"The Bone-Breaker,\" had a kindly, simple, but somewhat emotional\nnature. Nevertheless, it appeared as if he were laboring under some\npowerful indignation.\n\n\"Can we ask a question, Judge?\" he said, respectfully, although his\nvoice had the unmistakable Western-American ring in it, as of one who\nwas unconscious that he could be addressing any but his peers.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Judge, good-humoredly.\n\n\"We're finding in this yere piece, out of which the Kernel hes just\nbin a-quotin', some language that me and my pardners allow hadn't\norter to be read out afore a young lady in court--and we want to know\nof you--ez a fair-minded and impartial man--ef this is the reg'lar\nkind o' book given to gals and babies down at the meetin'-house.\"\n\n\"The jury will please follow the counsel's speech, without comment,\"\nsaid the Judge, briefly, fully aware that the defendant's counsel\nwould spring to his feet, as he did promptly. \"The Court will allow us\nto explain to the gentlemen that the language they seem to object to\nhas been accepted by the best theologians for the last thousand years\nas being purely mystic. As I will explain later, those are merely\nsymbols of the Church--\"\n\n\"Of wot?\" interrupted the foreman, in deep scorn.\n\n\"Of the Church!\"\n\n\"We ain't askin' any questions o' _you_--and we ain't takin' any\nanswers,\" said the foreman, sitting down promptly.\n\n\"I must insist,\" said the Judge, sternly, \"that the plaintiff's\ncounsel be allowed to continue his opening without interruption. You\"\n(to defendant's counsel) \"will have your opportunity to reply later.\"\n\nThe counsel sank down in his seat with the bitter conviction that the\njury was manifestly against him, and the case as good as lost. But his\nface was scarcely as disturbed as his client's, who, in great\nagitation, had begun to argue with him wildly, and was apparently\npressing some point against the lawyer's vehement opposal. The\nColonel's murky eyes brightened as he still stood erect with his hand\nthrust in his breast.\n\n\"It will be put to you, gentlemen, when the counsel on the other side\nrefrains from mere interruption and confines himself to reply, that my\nunfortunate client has no action--no remedy at law--because there were\nno spoken words of endearment. But, gentlemen, it will depend upon\n_you_ to say what are and what are not articulate expressions of love.\nWe all know that among the lower animals, with whom you may possibly\nbe called upon to classify the defendant, there are certain signals\nmore or less harmonious, as the case may be. The ass brays, the horse\nneighs, the sheep bleats--the feathered denizens of the grove call to\ntheir mates in more musical roundelays. These are recognized facts,\ngentlemen, which you yourselves, as dwellers among nature in this\nbeautiful land, are all cognizant of. They are facts that no one would\ndeny--and we should have a poor opinion of the ass who, at--er--such a\nsupreme moment, would attempt to suggest that his call was unthinking\nand without significance. But, gentlemen, I shall prove to you that\nsuch was the foolish, self-convicting custom of the defendant. With\nthe greatest reluctance, and the--er--greatest pain, I succeeded in\nwresting from the maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent\nconfession that the defendant had induced her to correspond with him\nin these methods. Picture to yourself, gentlemen, the lonely moonlight\nroad beside the widow's humble cottage. It is a beautiful night,\nsanctified to the affections, and the innocent girl is leaning from\nher casement. Presently there appears upon the road a slinking,\nstealthy figure--the defendant, on his way to church. True to the\ninstruction she has received from him, her lips part in the musical\nutterance\" (the Colonel lowered his voice in a faint falsetto,\npresumably in fond imitation of his fair client),\"'Kerree!' Instantly\nthe night became resonant with the impassioned reply\" (the Colonel\nhere lifted his voice in stentorian tones), \"'Kerrow.' Again, as he\npasses, rises the soft 'Kerree'; again, as his form is lost in the\ndistance, comes back the deep 'Kerrow.'\"\n\nA burst of laughter, long, loud, and irrepressible, struck the whole\ncourtroom, and before the Judge could lift his half-composed face and\ntake his handkerchief from his mouth, a faint \"Kerree\" from some\nunrecognized obscurity of the courtroom was followed by a loud\n\"Kerrow\" from some opposite locality. \"The sheriff will clear the\ncourt,\" said the Judge, sternly; but alas, as the embarrassed and\nchoking officials rushed hither and thither, a soft \"Kerree\" from the\nspectators at the window, _outside_ the courthouse, was answered by a\nloud chorus of \"Kerrows\" from the opposite windows, filled with\nonlookers. Again the laughter arose everywhere--even the fair\nplaintiff herself sat convulsed behind her handkerchief.\n\nThe figure of Colonel Starbottle alone remained erect--white and\nrigid. And then the Judge, looking up, saw what no one else in the\ncourt had seen--that the Colonel was sincere and in earnest; that what\nhe had conceived to be the pleader's most perfect acting, and most\nelaborate irony, were the deep, serious, mirthless _convictions_ of a\nman without the least sense of humor. There was a touch of this\nrespect in the Judge's voice as he said to him, gently, \"You may\nproceed, Colonel Starbottle.\"\n\n\"I thank your Honor,\" said the Colonel, slowly, \"for recognizing and\ndoing all in your power to prevent an interruption that, during my\nthirty years' experience at the bar, I have never yet been subjected\nto without the privilege of holding the instigators thereof\nresponsible--_personally_ responsible. It is possibly my fault that I\nhave failed, oratorically, to convey to the gentlemen of the jury the\nfull force and significance of the defendant's signals. I am aware\nthat my voice is singularly deficient in producing either the dulcet\ntones of my fair client or the impassioned vehemence of the\ndefendant's repose. I will,\" continued the Colonel, with a fatigued\nbut blind fatuity that ignored the hurriedly knit brows and warning\neyes of the Judge, \"try again. The note uttered by my client\"\n(lowering his voice to the faintest of falsettos) \"was 'Kerree'; the\nresponse was 'Kerrow'\"--and the Colonel's voice fairly shook the dome\nabove him.\n\nAnother uproar of laughter followed this apparently audacious\nrepetition, but was interrupted by an unlooked-for incident. The\ndefendant rose abruptly, and tearing himself away from the withholding\nhand and pleading protestations of his counsel, absolutely fled from\nthe courtroom, his appearance outside being recognized by a prolonged\n\"Kerrow\" from the bystanders, which again and again followed him in\nthe distance. In the momentary silence which followed, the Colonel's\nvoice was heard saying, \"We rest here, your Honor,\" and he sat down.\nNo less white, but more agitated, was the face of the defendant's\ncounsel, who instantly rose.\n\n\"For some unexplained reason, your Honor, my client desires to suspend\nfurther proceedings, with a view to effect a peaceable compromise with\nthe plaintiff. As he is a man of wealth and position, he is able and\nwilling to pay liberally for that privilege. While I, as his counsel,\nam still convinced of his legal irresponsibility, as he has chosen,\nhowever, to publicly abandon his rights here, I can only ask your\nHonor's permission to suspend further proceedings until I can confer\nwith Colonel Starbottle.\"\n\n\"As far as I can follow the pleadings,\" said the Judge, gravely, \"the\ncase seems to be hardly one for litigation, and I approve of the\ndefendant's course, while I strongly urge the plaintiff to accept it.\"\n\nColonel Starbottle bent over his fair client. Presently he rose,\nunchanged in look or demeanor. \"I yield, your Honor, to the wishes of\nmy client, and--er--lady. We accept.\"\n\nBefore the court adjourned that day it was known throughout the town\nthat Adoniram K. Hotchkiss had compromised the suit for four thousand\ndollars and costs.\n\nColonel Starbottle had so far recovered his equanimity as to strut\njauntily towards his office, where he was to meet his fair client. He\nwas surprised, however, to find her already there, and in company with\na somewhat sheepish-looking young man--a stranger. If the Colonel had\nany disappointment in meeting a third party to the interview, his\nold-fashioned courtesy did not permit him to show it. He bowed\ngraciously, and politely motioned them each to a seat.\n\n\"I reckoned I'd bring Hiram round with me,\" said the young lady,\nlifting her searching eyes, after a pause, to the Colonel's, \"though\nhe was awful shy, and allowed that you didn't know him from Adam--or\neven suspected his existence. But I said, 'That's just where you slip\nup, Hiram; a pow'ful man like the Colonel knows everything--and I've\nseen it in his eye.' Lordy!\" she continued, with a laugh, leaning\nforward over her parasol, as her eyes again sought the Colonel's,\n\"don't you remember when you asked me if I loved that old Hotchkiss,\nand I told you 'That's tellin',' and you looked at me, Lordy! I knew\n_then_ you suspected there was a Hiram _somewhere_--as good as if I'd\ntold you. Now, you, jest get up, Hiram, and give the Colonel a good\nhandshake. For if it wasn't for _him_ and _his_ searchin' ways, and\n_his_ awful power of language, I wouldn't hev got that four thousand\ndollars out o' that flirty fool Hotchkiss--enough to buy a farm, so as\nyou and me could get married! That's what you owe to _him_. Don't\nstand there like a stuck fool starin' at him. He won't eat you--though\nhe's killed many a better man. Come, have _I_ got to do _all_ the\nkissin'!\"\n\nIt is of record that the Colonel bowed so courteously and so\nprofoundly that he managed not merely to evade the proffered hand of\nthe shy Hiram, but to only lightly touch the franker and more\nimpulsive fingertips of the gentle Zaidee. \"I--er--offer my sincerest\ncongratulations--though I think you--er--overestimate--my--er--powers\nof penetration. Unfortunately, a pressing engagement, which may oblige\nme also to leave town to-night, forbids my saying more. I\nhave--er--left the--er--business settlement of this--er--case in the\nhands of the lawyers who do my office-work, and who will show you\nevery attention. And now let me wish you a very good afternoon.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Colonel returned to his private room, and it was\nnearly twilight when the faithful Jim entered, to find him sitting\nmeditatively before his desk. \"'Fo' God! Kernel--I hope dey ain't\nnuffin de matter, but you's lookin' mightly solemn! I ain't seen you\nlook dat way, Kernel, since de day pooh Marse Stryker was fetched home\nshot froo de head.\"\n\n\"Hand me down the whiskey, Jim,\" said the Colonel, rising slowly.\n\nThe negro flew to the closet joyfully, and brought out the bottle. The\nColonel poured out a glass of the spirit and drank it with his old\ndeliberation.\n\n\"You're quite right, Jim,\" he said, putting down his glass, \"but\nI'm--er--getting old--and--somehow--I am missing poor Stryker\ndamnably!\"\n\n\n\nTHE DUPLICITY OF HARGRAVES\n\nBy O. Henry (1862-1910)\n\n[From _The Junior Munsey_, February, 1902. Republished in the volume,\n_Sixes and Sevens_ (1911), by O. Henry; copyright, 1911, by Doubleday,\nPage & Co.; reprinted by their permission.]\n\nWhen Major Pendleton Talbot, of Mobile, sir, and his daughter, Miss\nLydia Talbot, came to Washington to reside, they selected for a\nboarding place a house that stood fifty yards back from one of the\nquietest avenues. It was an old-fashioned brick building, with a\nportico upheld by tall white pillars. The yard was shaded by stately\nlocusts and elms, and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and\nwhite blossoms upon the grass. Rows of high box bushes lined the fence\nand walks. It was the Southern style and aspect of the place that\npleased the eyes of the Talbots.\n\nIn this pleasant private boarding house they engaged rooms, including\na study for Major Talbot, who was adding the finishing chapters to his\nbook, _Anecdotes and Reminiscences of the Alabama Army, Bench, and\nBar_.\n\nMajor Talbot was of the old, old South. The present day had little\ninterest or excellence in his eyes. His mind lived in that period\nbefore the Civil War when the Talbots owned thousands of acres of fine\ncotton land and the slaves to till them; when the family mansion was\nthe scene of princely hospitality, and drew its guests from the\naristocracy of the South. Out of that period he had brought all its\nold pride and scruples of honor, an antiquated and punctilious\npoliteness, and (you would think) its wardrobe.\n\nSuch clothes were surely never made within fifty years. The Major was\ntall, but whenever he made that wonderful, archaic genuflexion he\ncalled a bow, the corners of his frock coat swept the floor. That\ngarment was a surprise even to Washington, which has long ago ceased\nto shy at the frocks and broad-brimmed hats of Southern Congressmen.\nOne of the boarders christened it a \"Father Hubbard,\" and it certainly\nwas high in the waist and full in the skirt.\n\nBut the Major, with all his queer clothes, his immense area of\nplaited, raveling shirt bosom, and the little black string tie with\nthe bow always slipping on one side, both was smiled at and liked in\nMrs. Vardeman's select boarding house. Some of the young department\nclerks would often \"string him,\" as they called it, getting him\nstarted upon the subject dearest to him--the traditions and history of\nhis beloved Southland. During his talks he would quote freely from the\n_Anecdotes and Reminiscences_. But they were very careful not to let\nhim see their designs, for in spite of his sixty-eight years he could\nmake the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his\npiercing gray eyes.\n\nMiss Lydia was a plump, little old maid of thirty-five, with smoothly\ndrawn, tightly twisted hair that made her look still older.\nOld-fashioned, too, she was; but antebellum glory did not radiate from\nher as it did from the Major. She possessed a thrifty common sense,\nand it was she who handled the finances of the family, and met all\ncomers when there were bills to pay. The Major regarded board bills\nand wash bills as contemptible nuisances. They kept coming in so\npersistently and so often. Why, the Major wanted to know, could they\nnot be filed and paid in a lump sum at some convenient period--say\nwhen the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_ had been published and paid\nfor? Miss Lydia would calmly go on with her sewing and say, \"We'll pay\nas we go as long as the money lasts, and then perhaps they'll have to\nlump it.\"\n\nMost of Mrs. Vardeman's boarders were away during the day, being\nnearly all department clerks and business men; but there was one of\nthem who was about the house a great deal from morning to night. This\nwas a young man named Henry Hopkins Hargraves--every one in the house\naddressed him by his full name--who was engaged at one of the popular\nvaudeville theaters. Vaudeville has risen to such a respectable plane\nin the last few years, and Mr. Hargraves was such a modest and\nwell-mannered person, that Mrs. Vardeman could find no objection to\nenrolling him upon her list of boarders.\n\nAt the theater Hargraves was known as an all-round dialect comedian,\nhaving a large repertoire of German, Irish, Swede, and black-face\nspecialties. But Mr. Hargraves was ambitious, and often spoke of his\ngreat desire to succeed in legitimate comedy.\n\nThis young man appeared to conceive a strong fancy for Major Talbot.\nWhenever that gentleman would begin his Southern reminiscences, or\nrepeat some of the liveliest of the anecdotes, Hargraves could always\nbe found, the most attentive among his listeners.\n\nFor a time the Major showed an inclination to discourage the advances\nof the \"play actor,\" as he privately termed him; but soon the young\nman's agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old\ngentleman's stories completely won him over.\n\nIt was not long before the two were like old chums. The Major set\napart each afternoon to read to him the manuscript of his book. During\nthe anecdotes Hargraves never failed to laugh at exactly the right\npoint. The Major was moved to declare to Miss Lydia one day that young\nHargraves possessed remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for\nthe old regime. And when it came to talking of those old days--if\nMajor Talbot liked to talk, Mr. Hargraves was entranced to listen.\n\nLike almost all old people who talk of the past, the Major loved to\nlinger over details. In describing the splendid, almost royal, days of\nthe old planters, he would hesitate until he had recalled the name of\nthe negro who held his horse, or the exact date of certain minor\nhappenings, or the number of bales of cotton raised in such a year;\nbut Hargraves never grew impatient or lost interest. On the contrary,\nhe would advance questions on a variety of subjects connected with the\nlife of that time, and he never failed to extract ready replies.\n\nThe fox hunts, the 'possum suppers, the hoe-downs and jubilees in the\nnegro quarters, the banquets in the plantation-house hall, when\ninvitations went for fifty miles around; the occasional feuds with the\nneighboring gentry; the Major's duel with Rathbone Culbertson about\nKitty Chalmers, who afterward married a Thwaite of South Carolina; and\nprivate yacht races for fabulous sums on Mobile Bay; the quaint\nbeliefs, improvident habits, and loyal virtues of the old slaves--all\nthese were subjects that held both the Major and Hargraves absorbed\nfor hours at a time.\n\nSometimes, at night, when the young man would be coming upstairs to\nhis room after his turn at the theater was over, the Major would\nappear at the door of his study and beckon archly to him. Going in,\nHargraves would find a little table set with a decanter, sugar bowl,\nfruit, and a big bunch of fresh green mint.\n\n\"It occurred to me,\" the Major would begin--he was always\nceremonious--\"that perhaps you might have found your duties at the--at\nyour place of occupation--sufficiently arduous to enable you, Mr.\nHargraves, to appreciate what the poet might well have had in his mind\nwhen he wrote, 'tired Nature's sweet restorer'--one of our Southern\njuleps.\"\n\nIt was a fascination to Hargraves to watch him make it. He took rank\namong artists when he began, and he never varied the process. With\nwhat delicacy he bruised the mint; with what exquisite nicety he\nestimated the ingredients; with what solicitous care he capped the\ncompound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe!\nAnd then the hospitality and grace with which he offered it, after the\nselected oat straws had been plunged into its tinkling depths!\n\nAfter about four months in Washington, Miss Lydia discovered one\nmorning that they were almost without money. The _Anecdotes and\nReminiscences_ was completed, but publishers had not jumped at the\ncollected gems of Alabama sense and wit. The rental of a small house\nwhich they still owned in Mobile was two months in arrears. Their\nboard money for the month would be due in three days. Miss Lydia\ncalled her father to a consultation.\n\n\"No money?\" said he with a surprised look. \"It is quite annoying to be\ncalled on so frequently for these petty sums, Really, I--\"\n\nThe Major searched his pockets. He found only a two-dollar bill, which\nhe returned to his vest pocket.\n\n\"I must attend to this at once, Lydia,\" he said. \"Kindly get me my\numbrella and I will go downtown immediately. The congressman from our\ndistrict, General Fulghum, assured me some days ago that he would use\nhis influence to get my book published at an early date. I will go to\nhis hotel at once and see what arrangement has been made.\"\n\nWith a sad little smile Miss Lydia watched him button his \"Father\nHubbard\" and depart, pausing at the door, as he always did, to bow\nprofoundly.\n\nThat evening, at dark, he returned. It seemed that Congressman Fulghum\nhad seen the publisher who had the Major's manuscript for reading.\nThat person had said that if the anecdotes, etc., were carefully\npruned down about one-half, in order to eliminate the sectional and\nclass prejudice with which the book was dyed from end to end, he might\nconsider its publication.\n\nThe Major was in a white heat of anger, but regained his equanimity,\naccording to his code of manners, as soon as he was in Miss Lydia's\npresence.\n\n\"We must have money,\" said Miss Lydia, with a little wrinkle above her\nnose. \"Give me the two dollars, and I will telegraph to Uncle Ralph\nfor some to-night.\"\n\nThe Major drew a small envelope from his upper vest pocket and tossed\nit on the table.\n\n\"Perhaps it was injudicious,\" he said mildly, \"but the sum was so\nmerely nominal that I bought tickets to the theater to-night. It's a\nnew war drama, Lydia. I thought you would be pleased to witness its\nfirst production in Washington. I am told that the South has very fair\ntreatment in the play. I confess I should like to see the performance\nmyself.\"\n\nMiss Lydia threw up her hands in silent despair.\n\nStill, as the tickets were bought, they might as well be used. So that\nevening, as they sat in the theater listening to the lively overture,\neven Miss Lydia was minded to relegate their troubles, for the hour,\nto second place. The Major, in spotless linen, with his extraordinary\ncoat showing only where it was closely buttoned, and his white hair\nsmoothly roached, looked really fine and distinguished. The curtain\nwent up on the first act of _A Magnolia Flower_, revealing a typical\nSouthern plantation scene. Major Talbot betrayed some interest.\n\n\"Oh, see!\" exclaimed Miss Lydia, nudging his arm, and pointing to her\nprogram.\n\nThe Major put on his glasses and read the line in the cast of\ncharacters that her fingers indicated.\n\nCol. Webster Calhoun .... Mr. Hopkins Hargraves.\n\n\"It's our Mr. Hargraves,\" said Miss Lydia. \"It must be his first\nappearance in what he calls 'the legitimate.' I'm so glad for him.\"\n\nNot until the second act did Col. Webster Calhoun appear upon the\nstage. When he made his entry Major Talbot gave an audible sniff,\nglared at him, and seemed to freeze solid. Miss Lydia uttered a\nlittle, ambiguous squeak and crumpled her program in her hand. For\nColonel Calhoun was made up as nearly resembling Major Talbot as one\npea does another. The long, thin white hair, curly at the ends, the\naristocratic beak of a nose, the crumpled, wide, raveling shirt front,\nthe string tie, with the bow nearly under one ear, were almost exactly\nduplicated. And then, to clinch the imitation, he wore the twin to the\nMajor's supposed to be unparalleled coat. High-collared, baggy,\nempire-waisted, ample-skirted, hanging a foot lower in front than\nbehind, the garment could have been designed from no other pattern.\nFrom then on, the Major and Miss Lydia sat bewitched, and saw the\ncounterfeit presentment of a haughty Talbot \"dragged,\" as the Major\nafterward expressed it, \"through the slanderous mire of a corrupt\nstage.\"\n\nMr. Hargraves had used his opportunities well. He had caught the\nMajor's little idiosyncrasies of speech, accent, and intonation and\nhis pompous courtliness to perfection--exaggerating all to the purpose\nof the stage. When he performed that marvelous bow that the Major\nfondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations, the audience sent\nforth a sudden round of hearty applause.\n\nMiss Lydia sat immovable, not daring to glance toward her father.\nSometimes her hand next to him would be laid against her cheek, as if\nto conceal the smile which, in spite of her disapproval, she could not\nentirely suppress.\n\nThe culmination of Hargraves audacious imitation took place in the\nthird act. The scene is where Colonel Calhoun entertains a few of the\nneighboring planters in his \"den.\"\n\nStanding at a table in the center of the stage, with his friends\ngrouped about him, he delivers that inimitable, rambling character\nmonologue so famous in _A Magnolia Flower_, at the same time that he\ndeftly makes juleps for the party.\n\nMajor Talbot, sitting quietly, but white with indignation, heard his\nbest stories retold, his pet theories and hobbies advanced and\nexpanded, and the dream of the _Anecdotes and Reminiscences_ served,\nexaggerated and garbled. His favorite narrative--that of his duel with\nRathbone Culbertson--was not omitted, and it was delivered with more\nfire, egotism, and gusto than the Major himself put into it.\n\nThe monologue concluded with a quaint, delicious, witty little lecture\non the art of concocting a julep, illustrated by the act. Here Major\nTalbot's delicate but showy science was reproduced to a hair's\nbreadth--from his dainty handling of the fragrant weed--\"the\none-thousandth part of a grain too much pressure, gentlemen, and you\nextract the bitterness, instead of the aroma, of this heaven-bestowed\nplant\"--to his solicitous selection of the oaten straws.\n\nAt the close of the scene the audience raised a tumultuous roar of\nappreciation. The portrayal of the type was so exact, so sure and\nthorough, that the leading characters in the play were forgotten.\nAfter repeated calls, Hargraves came before the curtain and bowed, his\nrather boyish face bright and flushed with the knowledge of success.\n\nAt last Miss Lydia turned and looked at the Major. His thin nostrils\nwere working like the gills of a fish. He laid both shaking hands upon\nthe arms of his chair to rise.\n\n\"We will go, Lydia,\" he said chokingly. \"This is an\nabominable--desecration.\"\n\nBefore he could rise, she pulled him back into his seat.\n\n\"We will stay it out,\" she declared. \"Do you want to advertise the\ncopy by exhibiting the original coat?\" So they remained to the end.\n\nHargraves's success must have kept him up late that night, for neither\nat the breakfast nor at the dinner table did he appear.\n\nAbout three in the afternoon he tapped at the door of Major Talbot's\nstudy. The Major opened it, and Hargraves walked in with his hands\nfull of the morning papers--too full of his triumph to notice anything\nunusual in the Major's demeanor.\n\n\"I put it all over 'em last night, Major,\" he began exultantly. \"I had\nmy inning, and, I think, scored. Here's what _The Post_ says:\n\n\"'His conception and portrayal of the old-time Southern colonel, with\nhis absurd grandiloquence, his eccentric garb, his quaint idioms and\nphrases, his motheaten pride of family, and his really kind heart,\nfastidious sense of honor, and lovable simplicity, is the best\ndelineation of a character role on the boards to-day. The coat worn by\nColonel Calhoun is itself nothing less than an evolution of genius.\nMr. Hargraves has captured his public.'\n\n\"How does that sound, Major, for a first-nighter?\"\n\n\"I had the honor\"--the Major's voice sounded ominously frigid--\"of\nwitnessing your very remarkable performance, sir, last night.\"\n\nHargraves looked disconcerted.\n\n\"You were there? I didn't know you ever--I didn't know you cared for\nthe theater. Oh, I say, Major Talbot,\" he exclaimed frankly, \"don't\nyou be offended. I admit I did get a lot of pointers from you that\nhelped out wonderfully in the part. But it's a type, you know--not\nindividual. The way the audience caught on shows that. Half the\npatrons of that theater are Southerners. They recognized it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hargraves,\" said the Major, who had remained standing, \"you have\nput upon me an unpardonable insult. You have burlesqued my person,\ngrossly betrayed my confidence, and misused my hospitality. If I\nthought you possessed the faintest conception of what is the sign\nmanual of a gentleman, or what is due one, I would call you out, sir,\nold as I am. I will ask you to leave the room, sir.\"\n\nThe actor appeared to be slightly bewildered, and seemed hardly to\ntake in the full meaning of the old gentleman's words.\n\n\"I am truly sorry you took offense,\" he said regretfully. \"Up here we\ndon't look at things just as you people do. I know men who would buy\nout half the house to have their personality put on the stage so the\npublic would recognize it.\"\n\n\"They are not from Alabama, sir,\" said the Major haughtily.\n\n\"Perhaps not. I have a pretty good memory, Major; let me quote a few\nlines from your book. In response to a toast at a banquet given\nin--Milledgeville, I believe--you uttered, and intend to have printed,\nthese words:\n\n\"'The Northern man is utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so\nfar as the feelings may be turned to his own commercial profit. He\nwill suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honor of\nhimself or his loved ones that does not bear with it the consequence\nof pecuniary loss. In his charity, he gives with a liberal hand; but\nit must be heralded with the trumpet and chronicled in brass.'\n\n\"Do you think that picture is fairer than the one you saw of Colonel\nCalhoun last night?\"\n\n\"The description,\" said the Major, frowning, \"is--not without grounds.\nSome exag--latitude must be allowed in public speaking.\"\n\n\"And in public acting,\" replied Hargraves.\n\n\"That is not the point,\" persisted the Major, unrelenting. \"It was a\npersonal caricature. I positively decline to overlook it, sir.\"\n\n\"Major Talbot,\" said Hargraves, with a winning smile, \"I wish you\nwould understand me. I want you to know that I never dreamed of\ninsulting you. In my profession, all life belongs to me. I take what I\nwant, and what I can, and return it over the footlights. Now, if you\nwill, let's let it go at that. I came in to see you about something\nelse. We've been pretty good friends for some months, and I'm going to\ntake the risk of offending you again. I know you are hard up for\nmoney--never mind how I found out, a boarding house is no place to\nkeep such matters secret--and I want you to let me help you out of the\npinch. I've been there often enough myself. I've been getting a fair\nsalary all the season, and I've saved some money. You're welcome to a\ncouple hundred--or even more--until you get----\"\n\n\"Stop!\" commanded the Major, with his arm outstretched. \"It seems that\nmy book didn't lie, after all. You think your money salve will heal\nall the hurts of honor. Under no circumstances would I accept a loan\nfrom a casual acquaintance; and as to you, sir, I would starve before\nI would consider your insulting offer of a financial adjustment of the\ncircumstances we have discussed. I beg to repeat my request relative\nto your quitting the apartment.\"\n\nHargraves took his departure without another word. He also left the\nhouse the same day, moving, as Mrs. Vardeman explained at the supper\ntable, nearer the vicinity of the downtown theater, where _A Magnolia\nFlower_ was booked for a week's run.\n\nCritical was the situation with Major Talbot and Miss Lydia. There was\nno one in Washington to whom the Major's scruples allowed him to apply\nfor a loan. Miss Lydia wrote a letter to Uncle Ralph, but it was\ndoubtful whether that relative's constricted affairs would permit him\nto furnish help. The Major was forced to make an apologetic address to\nMrs. Vardeman regarding the delayed payment for board, referring to\n\"delinquent rentals\" and \"delayed remittances\" in a rather confused\nstrain.\n\nDeliverance came from an entirely unexpected source.\n\nLate one afternoon the door maid came up and announced an old colored\nman who wanted to see Major Talbot. The Major asked that he be sent up\nto his study. Soon an old darkey appeared in the doorway, with his hat\nin hand, bowing, and scraping with one clumsy foot. He was quite\ndecently dressed in a baggy suit of black. His big, coarse shoes shone\nwith a metallic luster suggestive of stove polish. His bushy wool was\ngray--almost white. After middle life, it is difficult to estimate the\nage of a negro. This one might have seen as many years as had Major\nTalbot.\n\n\"I be bound you don't know me, Mars' Pendleton,\" were his first words.\n\nThe Major rose and came forward at the old, familiar style of address.\nIt was one of the old plantation darkeys without a doubt; but they had\nbeen widely scattered, and he could not recall the voice or face.\n\n\"I don't believe I do,\" he said kindly--\"unless you will assist my\nmemory.\"\n\n\"Don't you 'member Cindy's Mose, Mars' Pendleton, what 'migrated\n'mediately after de war?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said the Major, rubbing his forehead with the tips of\nhis fingers. He loved to recall everything connected with those\nbeloved days. \"Cindy's Mose,\" he reflected. \"You worked among the\nhorses--breaking the colts. Yes, I remember now. After the surrender,\nyou took the name of--don't prompt me--Mitchell, and went to the\nWest--to Nebraska.\"\n\n\"Yassir, yassir,\"--the old man's face stretched with a delighted\ngrin--\"dat's him, dat's it. Newbraska. Dat's me--Mose Mitchell. Old\nUncle Mose Mitchell, dey calls me now. Old mars', your pa, gimme a pah\nof dem mule colts when I lef' fur to staht me goin' with. You 'member\ndem colts, Mars' Pendleton?\"\n\n\"I don't seem to recall the colts,\" said the Major. \"You know. I was\nmarried the first year of the war and living at the old Follinsbee\nplace. But sit down, sit down, Uncle Mose. I'm glad to see you. I hope\nyou have prospered.\"\n\nUncle Mose took a chair and laid his hat carefully on the floor beside\nit.\n\n\"Yessir; of late I done mouty famous. When I first got to Newbraska,\ndey folks come all roun' me to see dem mule colts. Dey ain't see no\nmules like dem in Newbraska. I sold dem mules for three hundred\ndollars. Yessir--three hundred.\n\n\"Den I open a blacksmith shop, suh, and made some money and bought\nsome lan'. Me and my old 'oman done raised up seb'm chillun, and all\ndoin' well 'cept two of 'em what died. Fo' year ago a railroad come\nalong and staht a town slam ag'inst my lan', and, suh, Mars'\nPendleton, Uncle Mose am worth leb'm thousand dollars in money,\nproperty, and lan'.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear it,\" said the Major heartily. \"Glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"And dat little baby of yo'n, Mars' Pendleton--one what you name Miss\nLyddy--I be bound dat little tad done growed up tell nobody wouldn't\nknow her.\"\n\nThe Major stepped to the door and called: \"Lydie, dear, will you\ncome?\"\n\nMiss Lydia, looking quite grown up and a little worried, came in from\nher room.\n\n\"Dar, now! What'd I tell you? I knowed dat baby done be plum growed\nup. You don't 'member Uncle Mose, child?\"\n\n\"This is Aunt Cindy's Mose, Lydia,\" explained the Major. \"He left\nSunnymead for the West when you were two years old.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Miss Lydia, \"I can hardly be expected to remember you,\nUncle Mose, at that age. And, as you say, I'm 'plum growed up,' and\nwas a blessed long time ago. But I'm glad to see you, even if I can't\nremember you.\"\n\nAnd she was. And so was the Major. Something alive and tangible had\ncome to link them with the happy past. The three sat and talked over\nthe olden times, the Major and Uncle Mose correcting or prompting each\nother as they reviewed the plantation scenes and days.\n\nThe Major inquired what the old man was doing so far from his home.\n\n\"Uncle Mose am a delicate,\" he explained, \"to de grand Baptis'\nconvention in dis city. I never preached none, but bein' a residin'\nelder in de church, and able fur to pay my own expenses, dey sent me\nalong.\"\n\n\"And how did you know we were in Washington?\" inquired Miss Lydia.\n\n\"Dey's a cullud man works in de hotel whar I stops, what comes from\nMobile. He told me he seen Mars' Pendleton comin' outen dish here\nhouse one mawnin'.\n\n\"What I come fur,\" continued Uncle Mose, reaching into his\npocket--\"besides de sight of home folks--was to pay Mars' Pendleton\nwhat I owes him.\n\n\"Yessir--three hundred dollars.\" He handed the Major a roll of bills.\n\"When I lef' old mars' says: 'Take dem mule colts, Mose, and, if it be\nso you gits able, pay fur 'em.' Yessir--dem was his words. De war had\ndone lef' old mars' po' hisself. Old mars' bein' long ago dead, de\ndebt descends to Mars' Pendleton. Three hundred dollars. Uncle Mose is\nplenty able to pay now. When dat railroad buy my lan' I laid off to\npay fur dem mules. Count de money, Mars' Pendleton. Dat's what I sold\ndem mules fur. Yessir.\"\n\nTears were in Major Talbot's eyes. He took Uncle Mose's hand and laid\nhis other upon his shoulder.\n\n\"Dear, faithful, old servitor,\" he said in an unsteady voice, \"I don't\nmind saying to you that 'Mars' Pendleton spent his last dollar in the\nworld a week ago. We will accept this money, Uncle Mose, since, in a\nway, it is a sort of payment, as well as a token of the loyalty and\ndevotion of the old regime. Lydia, my dear, take the money. You are\nbetter fitted than I to manage its expenditure.\"\n\n\"Take it, honey,\" said Uncle Mose. \"Hit belongs to you. Hit's Talbot\nmoney.\"\n\nAfter Uncle Mose had gone, Miss Lydia had a good cry---for joy; and\nthe Major turned his face to a corner, and smoked his clay pipe\nvolcanically.\n\nThe succeeding days saw the Talbots restored to peace and ease. Miss\nLydia's face lost its worried look. The major appeared in a new frock\ncoat, in which he looked like a wax figure personifying the memory of\nhis golden age. Another publisher who read the manuscript of the\n_Anecdotes and Reminiscences_ thought that, with a little retouching\nand toning down of the high lights, he could make a really bright and\nsalable volume of it. Altogether, the situation was comfortable, and\nnot without the touch of hope that is often sweeter than arrived\nblessings.\n\nOne day, about a week after their piece of good luck, a maid brought a\nletter for Miss Lydia to her room. The postmark showed that it was\nfrom New York. Not knowing any one there, Miss Lydia, in a mild\nflutter of wonder, sat down by her table and opened the letter with\nher scissors. This was what she read:\n\nDEAR MISS TALBOT:\n\nI thought you might be glad to learn of my good fortune. I have\nreceived and accepted an offer of two hundred dollars per week by a\nNew York stock company to play Colonel Calhoun in _A Magnolia Flower_.\n\nThere is something else I wanted you to know. I guess you'd better not\ntell Major Talbot. I was anxious to make him some amends for the great\nhelp he was to me in studying the part, and for the bad humor he was\nin about it. He refused to let me, so I did it anyhow. I could easily\nspare the three hundred.\n\nSincerely yours,\nH. HOPKINS HARGRAVES.\n\nP.S. How did I play Uncle Mose?\n\nMajor Talbot, passing through the hall, saw Miss Lydia's door open and\nstopped.\n\n\"Any mail for us this morning, Lydia, dear?\" he asked.\n\nMiss Lydia slid the letter beneath a fold of her dress.\n\n\"_The Mobile Chronicle_ came,\" she said promptly. \"It's on the table\nin your study.\"\n\n\n\nBARGAIN DAY AT TUTT HOUSE\n\nBy George Randolph Chester (1869- )\n\n[From McClure's Magazine, June, 1905; copyright, 1905, by the S.S.\nMcClure Co.; republished by the author's permission.]\n\nI\n\nJust as the stage rumbled over the rickety old bridge, creaking and\ngroaning, the sun came from behind the clouds that had frowned all the\nway, and the passengers cheered up a bit. The two richly dressed\nmatrons who had been so utterly and unnecessarily oblivious to the\npresence of each other now suspended hostilities for the moment by\nmutual and unspoken consent, and viewed with relief the little,\ngolden-tinted valley and the tree-clad road just beyond. The\nrespective husbands of these two ladies exchanged a mere glance, no\nmore, of comfort. They, too, were relieved, though more by the\nmomentary truce than by anything else. They regretted very much to be\ncompelled to hate each other, for each had reckoned up his vis-a-vis\nas a rather proper sort of fellow, probably a man of some achievement,\nused to good living and good company.\n\nExtreme iciness was unavoidable between them, however. When one\nstranger has a splendidly preserved blonde wife and the other a\nsplendidly preserved brunette wife, both of whom have won social\nprominence by years of hard fighting and aloofness, there remains\nnothing for the two men but to follow the lead, especially when\ndirectly under the eyes of the leaders.\n\nThe son of the blonde matron smiled cheerfully as the welcome light\nflooded the coach.\n\nHe was a nice-looking young man, of about twenty-two, one might judge,\nand he did his smiling, though in a perfectly impersonal and correct\nsort of manner, at the pretty daughter of the brunette matron. The\npretty daughter also smiled, but her smile was demurely directed at\nthe trees outside, clad as they were in all the flaming glory of their\nautumn tints, glistening with the recent rain and dripping with gems\nthat sparkled and flashed in the noonday sun as they fell.\n\nIt is marvelous how much one can see out of the corner of the eye,\nwhile seeming to view mere scenery.\n\nThe driver looked down, as he drove safely off the bridge, and shook\nhis head at the swirl of water that rushed and eddied, dark and muddy,\nclose up under the rotten planking; then he cracked his whip, and the\nhorses sturdily attacked the little hill.\n\nThick, overhanging trees on either side now dimmed the light again,\nand the two plump matrons once more glared past the opposite\nshoulders, profoundly unaware of each other. The husbands took on the\npolitely surly look required of them. The blonde son's eyes still\nsought the brunette daughter, but it was furtively done and quite\nunsuccessfully, for the daughter was now doing a little glaring on her\nown account. The blonde matron had just swept her eyes across the\ndaughter's skirt, estimating the fit and material of it with contempt\nso artistically veiled that it could almost be understood in the dark.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe big bays swung to the brow of the hill with ease, and dashed into\na small circular clearing, where a quaint little two-story building,\nwith a mossy watering-trough out in front, nestled under the shade of\nmajestic old trees that reared their brown and scarlet crowns proudly\ninto the sky. A long, low porch ran across the front of the structure,\nand a complaining sign hung out announcing, in dim, weather-flecked\nletters on a cracked board, that this was the \"Tutt House.\" A\ngray-headed man, in brown overalls and faded blue jumper, stood on the\nporch and shook his fist at the stage as it whirled by.\n\n\"What a delightfully old-fashioned inn!\" exclaimed the pretty\ndaughter. \"How I should like to stop there over night!\"\n\n\"You would probably wish yourself away before morning, Evelyn,\"\nreplied her mother indifferently. \"No doubt it would be a mere siege\nof discomfort.\"\n\nThe blonde matron turned to her husband. The pretty daughter had been\nlooking at the picturesque \"inn\" between the heads of this lady and\nher son.\n\n\"Edward, please pull down the shade behind me,\" she directed. \"There\nis quite a draught from that broken window.\"\n\nThe pretty daughter bit her lip. The brunette matron continued to\nstare at the shade in the exact spot upon which her gaze had been\nbefore directed, and she never quivered an eyelash. The young man\nseemed very uncomfortable, and he tried to look his apologies to the\npretty daughter, but she could not see him now, not even if her eyes\nhad been all corners.\n\nThey were bowling along through another avenue of trees when the\ndriver suddenly shouted, \"Whoa there!\"\n\nThe horses were brought up with a jerk that was well nigh fatal to the\nassortment of dignity inside the coach. A loud roaring could be heard,\nboth ahead and in the rear, a sharp splitting like a fusillade of\npistol shots, then a creaking and tearing of timbers. The driver bent\nsuddenly forward.\n\n\"Gid ap!\" he cried, and the horses sprang forward with a lurch. He\nswung them around a sharp bend with a skillful hand and poised his\nweight above the brake as they plunged at terrific speed down a steep\ngrade. The roaring was louder than ever now, and it became deafening\nas they suddenly emerged from the thick underbrush at the bottom of\nthe declivity.\n\n\"Caught, by gravy!\" ejaculated the driver, and, for the second time,\nhe brought the coach to an abrupt stop.\n\n\"Do see what is the matter, Ralph,\" said the blonde matron\nimpatiently.\n\nThus commanded, the young man swung out and asked the driver about it.\n\n\"Paintsville dam's busted,\" he was informed. \"I been a-lookin' fer it\nthis many a year, an' this here freshet done it. You see the holler\nthere? Well, they's ten foot o' water in it, an' it had ort to be\nstone dry. The bridge is tore out behind us, an' we're stuck here till\nthat water runs out. We can't git away till to-morry, anyways.\"\n\nHe pointed out the peculiar topography of the place, and Ralph got\nback in the coach.\n\n\"We're practically on a flood-made island,\" he exclaimed, with one eye\non the pretty daughter, \"and we shall have to stop over night at that\nquaint, old-fashioned inn we passed a few moments ago.\"\n\nThe pretty daughter's eyes twinkled, and he thought he caught a swift,\ndirect gleam from under the long lashes--but he was not sure.\n\n\"Dear me, how annoying,\" said the blonde matron, but the brunette\nmatron still stared, without the slightest trace of interest in\nanything else, at the infinitesimal spot she had selected on the\naffronting window-shade.\n\nThe two men gave sighs of resignation, and cast carefully concealed\nglances at each other, speculating on the possibility of a cigar and a\nglass, and maybe a good story or two, or possibly even a game of poker\nafter the evening meal. Who could tell what might or might not happen?\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nWhen the stage drew up in front of the little hotel, it found Uncle\nBilly Tutt prepared for his revenge. In former days the stage had\nalways stopped at the Tutt House for the noonday meal. Since the new\nrailway was built through the adjoining county, however, the stage\ntrip became a mere twelve-mile, cross-country transfer from one\nrailroad to another, and the stage made a later trip, allowing the\npassengers plenty of time for \"dinner\" before they started. Day after\nday, as the coach flashed by with its money-laden passengers, Uncle\nBilly had hoped that it would break down. But this was better, much\nbetter. The coach might be quickly mended, but not the flood.\n\n\"I'm a-goin' t' charge 'em till they squeal,\" he declared to the\ntimidly protesting Aunt Margaret, \"an' then I'm goin' t' charge 'em a\nleast mite more, drat 'em!\"\n\nHe retreated behind the rough wooden counter that did duty as a desk,\nslammed open the flimsy, paper-bound \"cash book\" that served as a\nregister, and planted his elbows uncompromisingly on either side of\nit.\n\n\"Let 'em bring in their own traps,\" he commented, and Aunt Margaret\nfled, ashamed and conscience-smitten, to the kitchen. It seemed awful.\n\nThe first one out of the coach was the husband of the brunette matron,\nand, proceeding under instructions, he waited neither for luggage nor\nwomen folk, but hurried straight into the Tutt House. The other man\nwould have been neck and neck with him in the race, if it had not been\nthat he paused to seize two suitcases and had the misfortune to drop\none, which burst open and scattered a choice assortment of lingerie\nfrom one end of the dingy coach to the other.\n\nIn the confusion of rescuing the fluffery, the owner of the suitcase\nhad to sacrifice her hauteur and help her husband and son block up the\naisle, while the other matron had the ineffable satisfaction of being\n_kept waiting_, at last being enabled to say, sweetly and with the\nmost polite consideration:\n\n\"Will you kindly allow me to pass?\"\n\nThe blonde matron raised up and swept her skirts back perfectly flat.\nShe was pale but collected. Her husband was pink but collected. Her\nson was crimson and uncollected. The brunette daughter could not have\nfound an eye anywhere in his countenance as she rustled out after her\nmother.\n\n\"I do hope that Belmont has been able to secure choice quarters,\" the\ntriumphing matron remarked as her daughter joined her on the ground.\n\"This place looked so very small that there can scarcely be more than\none comfortable suite in it.\"\n\nIt was a vital thrust. Only a splendidly cultivated self-control\nprevented the blonde matron from retaliating upon the unfortunate who\nhad muddled things. Even so, her eyes spoke whole shelves of volumes.\n\nThe man who first reached the register wrote, in a straight black\nscrawl, \"J. Belmont Van Kamp, wife, and daughter.\" There being no\nspace left for his address, he put none down.\n\n\"I want three adjoining rooms, en suite if possible,\" he demanded.\n\n\"Three!\" exclaimed Uncle Billy, scratching his head. \"Won't two do ye?\nI ain't got but six bedrooms in th' house. Me an' Marg't sleeps in\none, an' we're a-gittin' too old fer a shake-down on th' floor. I'll\nhave t' save one room fer th' driver, an' that leaves four. You take\ntwo now---\"\n\nMr. Van Kamp cast a hasty glance out of the window, The other man was\ngetting out of the coach. His own wife was stepping on the porch.\n\n\"What do you ask for meals and lodging until this time to-morrow?\" he\ninterrupted.\n\nThe decisive moment had arrived. Uncle Billy drew a deep breath.\n\n\"Two dollars a head!\" he defiantly announced. There! It was out! He\nwished Margaret had stayed to hear him say it.\n\nThe guest did not seem to be seriously shocked, and Uncle Billy was\nbeginning to be sorry he had not said three dollars, when Mr. Van Kamp\nstopped the landlord's own breath.\n\n\"I'll give you fifteen dollars for the three best rooms in the house,\"\nhe calmly said, and Landlord Tutt gasped as the money fluttered down\nunder his nose.\n\n\"Jis' take yore folks right on up, Mr. Kamp,\" said Uncle Billy,\npouncing on the money. \"Th' rooms is th' three right along th' hull\nfront o' th' house. I'll be up and make on a fire in a minute. Jis'\ntake th' _Jonesville Banner_ an' th' _Uticky Clarion_ along with ye.\"\n\nAs the swish of skirts marked the passage of the Van Kamps up the wide\nhall stairway, the other party swept into the room.\n\nThe man wrote, in a round flourish, \"Edward Eastman Ellsworth, wife,\nand son.\"\n\n\"I'd like three choice rooms, en suite,\" he said.\n\n\"Gosh!\" said Uncle Billy, regretfully. \"That's what Mr. Kamp wanted,\nfust off, an' he got it. They hain't but th' little room over th'\nkitchen left. I'll have to put you an' your wife in that, an' let your\nboy sleep with th' driver.\"\n\nThe consternation in the Ellsworth party was past calculating by any\nknown standards of measurement. The thing was an outrage! It was not\nto be borne! They would not submit to it!\n\nUncle Billy, however, secure in his mastery of the situation, calmly\nquartered them as he had said. \"An' let 'em splutter all they want\nto,\" he commented comfortably to himself.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe Ellsworths were holding a family indignation meeting on the broad\nporch when the Van Ramps came contentedly down for a walk, and brushed\nby them with unseeing eyes.\n\n\"It makes a perfectly fascinating suite,\" observed Mrs. Van Kamp, in a\npleasantly conversational tone that could be easily overheard by\nanyone impolite enough to listen. \"That delightful old-fashioned\nfireplace in the middle apartment makes it an ideal sitting-room, and\nthe beds are so roomy and comfortable.\"\n\n\"I just knew it would be like this!\" chirruped Miss Evelyn. \"I\nremarked as we passed the place, if you will remember, how charming it\nwould be to stop in this dear, quaint old inn over night. All my\nwishes seem to come true this year.\"\n\nThese simple and, of course, entirely unpremeditated remarks were as\nvinegar and wormwood to Mrs. Ellsworth, and she gazed after the\nretreating Van Kamps with a glint in her eye that would make one\nunderstand Lucretia Borgia at last.\n\nHer son also gazed after the retreating Van Kamp. She had an exquisite\nfigure, and she carried herself with a most delectable grace. As the\nparty drew away from the inn she dropped behind the elders and\nwandered off into a side path to gather autumn leaves.\n\nRalph, too, started off for a walk, but naturally not in the same\ndirection.\n\n\"Edward!\" suddenly said Mrs. Ellsworth. \"I want you to turn those\npeople out of that suite before night!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he replied with a sigh, and got up to do it. He had\nwrecked a railroad and made one, and had operated successful corners\nin nutmegs and chicory. No task seemed impossible. He walked in to see\nthe landlord.\n\n\"What are the Van Kamps paying you for those three rooms?\" he asked.\n\n\"Fifteen dollars,\" Uncle Billy informed him, smoking one of Mr. Van\nKamp's good cigars and twiddling his thumbs in huge content.\n\n\"I'll give you thirty for them. Just set their baggage outside and\ntell them the rooms are occupied.\"\n\n\"No sir-ree!\" rejoined Uncle Billy. \"A bargain's a bargain, an' I\nallus stick to one I make.\"\n\nMr. Ellsworth withdrew, but not defeated. He had never supposed that\nsuch an absurd proposition would be accepted. It was only a feeler,\nand he had noticed a wince of regret in his landlord. He sat down on\nthe porch and lit a strong cigar. His wife did not bother him. She\ngazed complacently at the flaming foliage opposite, and allowed him to\nthink. Getting impossible things was his business in life, and she had\nconfidence in him.\n\n\"I want to rent your entire house for a week,\" he announced to Uncle\nBilly a few minutes later. It had occurred to him that the flood might\nlast longer than they anticipated.\n\nUncle Billy's eyes twinkled.\n\n\"I reckon it kin be did,\" he allowed. \"I reckon a _ho_-tel man's got a\nright to rent his hull house ary minute.\"\n\n\"Of course he has. How much do you want?\"\n\nUncle Billy had made one mistake in not asking this sort of folks\nenough, and he reflected in perplexity.\n\n\"Make me a offer,\" he proposed. \"Ef it hain't enough I'll tell ye. You\nwant to rent th' hull place, back lot an' all?\"\n\n\"No, just the mere house. That will be enough,\" answered the other\nwith a smile. He was on the point of offering a hundred dollars, when\nhe saw the little wrinkles about Mr. Tutt's eyes, and he said\nseventy-five.\n\n\"Sho, ye're jokin'!\" retorted Uncle Billy. He had been considered a\nfine horse-trader in that part of the country. \"Make it a hundred and\ntwenty-five, an' I'll go ye.\"\n\nMr. Ellsworth counted out some bills.\n\n\"Here's a hundred,\" he said. \"That ought to be about right.\"\n\n\"Fifteen more,\" insisted Uncle Billy.\n\nWith a little frown of impatience the other counted off the extra\nmoney and handed it over. Uncle Billy gravely handed it back.\n\n\"Them's the fifteen dollars Mr. Kamp give me,\" he explained. \"You've\ngot the hull house fer a week, an' o' course all th' money that's\ntooken in is your'n. You kin do as ye please about rentin' out rooms\nto other folks, I reckon. A bargain's a bargain, an' I allus stick to\none I make.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nRalph Ellsworth stalked among the trees, feverishly searching for\nsquirrels, scarlet leaves, and the glint of a brown walking-dress,\nthis last not being so easy to locate in sunlit autumn woods. Time\nafter time he quickened his pace, only to find that he had been fooled\nby a patch of dogwood, a clump of haw bushes or even a leaf-strewn\nknoll, but at last he unmistakably saw the dress, and then he slowed\ndown to a careless saunter.\n\nShe was reaching up for some brilliantly colored maple leaves, and was\nentirely unconscious of his presence, especially after she had seen\nhim. Her pose showed her pretty figure to advantage, but, of course,\nshe did not know that. How should she?\n\nRalph admired the picture very much. The hat, the hair, the gown, the\ndainty shoes, even the narrow strip of silken hose that was revealed\nas she stood a-uptoe, were all of a deep, rich brown that proved an\nexquisite foil for the pink and cream of her cheeks. He remembered\nthat her eyes were almost the same shade, and wondered how it was that\nwomen-folk happened on combinations in dress that so well set off\ntheir natural charms. The fool!\n\nHe was about three trees away, now, and a panic akin to that which\nhunters describe as \"buck ague\" seized him. He decided that he really\nhad no excuse for coming any nearer. It would not do, either, to be\nseen staring at her if she should happen to turn her head, so he\nveered off, intending to regain the road. It would be impossible to do\nthis without passing directly in her range of vision, and he did not\nintend to try to avoid it. He had a fine, manly figure of his own.\n\nHe had just passed the nearest radius to her circle and was proceeding\nalong the tangent that he had laid out for himself, when the unwitting\nmaid looked carefully down and saw a tangle of roots at her very feet.\nShe was so unfortunate, a second later, as to slip her foot in this\nvery tangle and give her ankle ever so slight a twist.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Miss Van Kamp, and Ralph Ellsworth flew to the rescue. He\nhad not been noticing her at all, and yet he had started to her side\nbefore she had even cried out, which was strange. She had a very\nattractive voice.\n\n\"May I be of assistance?\" he anxiously inquired.\n\n\"I think not, thank you,\" she replied, compressing her lips to keep\nback the intolerable pain, and half-closing her eyes to show the fine\nlashes. Declining the proffered help, she extricated her foot, picked\nup her autumn branches, and turned away. She was intensely averse to\nanything that could be construed as a flirtation, even of the mildest,\nhe could certainly see that. She took a step, swayed slightly, dropped\nthe leaves, and clutched out her hand to him.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" she assured him in a moment, withdrawing the hand\nafter he had held it quite long enough. \"Nothing whatever. I gave my\nfoot a slight wrench, and turned the least bit faint for a moment.\"\n\n\"You must permit me to walk back, at least to the road, with you,\" he\ninsisted, gathering up her armload of branches. \"I couldn't think of\nleaving you here alone.\"\n\nAs he stooped to raise the gay woodland treasures he smiled to\nhimself, ever so slightly. This was not _his_ first season out,\neither.\n\n\"Delightful spot, isn't it?\" he observed as they regained the road and\nsauntered in the direction of the Tutt House.\n\n\"Quite so,\" she reservedly answered. She had noticed that smile as he\nstooped. He must be snubbed a little. It would be so good for him.\n\n\"You don't happen to know Billy Evans, of Boston, do you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think not. I am but very little acquainted in Boston.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" he went on. \"I was rather in hopes you knew Billy. All\nsorts of a splendid fellow, and knows everybody.\"\n\n\"Not quite, it seems,\" she reminded him, and he winced at the error.\nIn spite of the sly smile that he had permitted to himself, he was\nunusually interested.\n\nHe tried the weather, the flood, the accident, golf, books and three\ngood, substantial, warranted jokes, but the conversation lagged in\nspite of him. Miss Van Kamp would not for the world have it understood\nthat this unconventional meeting, made allowable by her wrenched\nankle, could possibly fulfill the functions of a formal introduction.\n\n\"What a ripping, queer old building that is!\" he exclaimed, making one\nmore brave effort as they came in sight of the hotel.\n\n\"It is, rather,\" she assented. \"The rooms in it are as quaint and\ndelightful as the exterior, too.\"\n\nShe looked as harmless and innocent as a basket of peaches as she said\nit, and never the suspicion of a smile deepened the dimple in the\ncheek toward him. The smile was glowing cheerfully away inside,\nthough. He could feel it, if he could not see it, and he laughed\naloud.\n\n\"Your crowd rather got the better of us there,\" he admitted with the\nkeen appreciation of one still quite close to college days.\n\n\"Of course, the mater is furious, but I rather look on it as a lark.\"\n\nShe thawed like an April icicle.\n\n\"It's perfectly jolly,\" she laughed with him. \"Awfully selfish of us,\ntoo, I know, but such loads of fun.\"\n\nThey were close to the Tutt House now, and her limp, that had entirely\ndisappeared as they emerged from the woods, now became quite\nperceptible. There might be people looking out of the windows, though\nit is hard to see why that should affect a limp.\n\nRalph was delighted to find that a thaw had set in, and he made one\nmore attempt to establish at least a proxy acquaintance.\n\n\"You don't happen to know Peyson Kingsley, of Philadelphia, do you?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't,\" she replied. \"I know so few Philadelphia people,\nyou see.\" She was rather regretful about it this time. He really was a\nclever sort of a fellow, in spite of that smile.\n\nThe center window in the second floor of the Tutt House swung open,\nits little squares of glass flashing jubilantly in the sunlight. Mrs.\nEllsworth leaned out over the sill, from the quaint old sitting-room\nof the _Van Kamp apartments_!\n\n\"Oh, Ralph!\" she called in her most dulcet tones. \"Kindly excuse\nyourself and come right on up to our suite for a few moments!\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIt is not nearly so easy to take a practical joke as to perpetrate\none. Evelyn was sitting thoughtfully on the porch when her father and\nmother returned. Mrs. Ellsworth was sitting at the center window\nabove, placidly looking out. Her eyes swept carelessly over the Van\nKamps, and unconcernedly passed on to the rest of the landscape.\n\nMrs. Van Kamp gasped and clutched the arm of her husband. There was no\nneed. He, too, had seen the apparition. Evelyn now, for the first\ntime, saw the real humor of the situation. She smiled as she thought\nof Ralph. She owed him one, but she never worried about her debts. She\nalways managed to get them paid, principal and interest.\n\nMr. Van Kamp suddenly glowered and strode into the Tutt House. Uncle\nBilly met him at the door, reflectively chewing a straw, and handed\nhim an envelope. Mr. Van Kamp tore it open and drew out a note. Three\nfive-dollar bills came out with it and fluttered to the porch floor.\nThis missive confronted him:\n\nMR. J. BELMONT VAN KAMP,\n\nDEAR SIR: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire Tutt\nHouse for the ensuing week, and am compelled to assume possession of\nthe three second-floor front rooms. Herewith I am enclosing the\nfifteen dollars you paid to secure the suite. You are quite welcome to\nmake use, as my guest, of the small room over the kitchen. You will\nfind your luggage in that room. Regretting any inconvenience that this\ntransaction may cause you, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\nEDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH.\n\nMr. Van Kamp passed the note to his wife and sat down or a large\nchair. He was glad that the chair was comfortable and roomy. Evelyn\npicked up the bills and tucked them into her waist. She never\noverlooked any of her perquisites. Mrs. Van Kamp read the note, and\nthe tip of her nose became white. She also sat down, but she was the\nfirst to find her voice.\n\n\"Atrocious!\" she exclaimed. \"Atrocious! Simply atrocious, Belmont.\nThis is a house of public entertainment. They _can't_ turn us out in\nthis high-minded manner! Isn't there a law or something to that\neffect?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't matter if there was,\" he thoughtfully replied. \"This\nfellow Ellsworth would be too clever to be caught by it. He would say\nthat the house was not a hotel but a private residence during the\nperiod for which he has rented it.\"\n\nPersonally, he rather admired Ellsworth. Seemed to be a resourceful\nsort of chap who knew how to make money behave itself, and do its\nlittle tricks without balking in the harness.\n\n\"Then you can make him take down the sign!\" his wife declared.\n\nHe shook his head decidedly.\n\n\"It wouldn't do, Belle,\" he replied. \"It would be spite, not\nretaliation, and not at all sportsmanlike. The course you suggest\nwould belittle us more than it would annoy them. There must be some\nother way.\"\n\nHe went in to talk with Uncle Billy.\n\n\"I want to buy this place,\" he stated. \"Is it for sale?\"\n\n\"It sartin is!\" replied Uncle Billy. He did not merely twinkle this\ntime. He grinned.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Three thousand dollars.\" Mr. Tutt was used to charging by this time,\nand he betrayed no hesitation.\n\n\"I'll write you out a check at once,\" and Mr. Van Kamp reached in his\npocket with the reflection that the spot, after all, was an ideal one\nfor a quiet summer retreat.\n\n\"Air you a-goin' t' scribble that there three thou-san' on a piece o'\npaper?\" inquired Uncle Billy, sitting bolt upright. \"Ef you air\na-figgerin' on that, Mr. Kamp, jis' you save yore time. I give a man\nfour dollars fer one o' them check things oncet, an' I owe myself them\nfour dollars yit.\"\n\nMr. Van Kamp retired in disorder, but the thought of his wife and\ndaughter waiting confidently on the porch stopped him. Moreover, the\nthing had resolved itself rather into a contest between Ellsworth and\nhimself, and he had done a little making and breaking of men and\nthings in his own time. He did some gatling-gun thinking out by the\nnewel-post, and presently rejoined Uncle Billy.\n\n\"Mr. Tutt, tell me just exactly what Mr. Ellsworth rented, please,\" he\nrequested.\n\n\"Th' hull house,\" replied Billy, and then he somewhat sternly added:\n\"Paid me spot cash fer it, too.\"\n\nMr. Van Kamp took a wad of loose bills from his trousers pocket,\nstraightened them out leisurely, and placed them in his bill book,\nalong with some smooth yellowbacks of eye-bulging denominations. Uncle\nBilly sat up and stopped twiddling his thumbs.\n\n\"Nothing was said about the furniture, was there?\" suavely inquired\nVan Kamp.\n\nUncle Billy leaned blankly back in his chair. Little by little the\nlight dawned on the ex-horse-trader. The crow's feet reappeared about\nhis eyes, his mouth twitched, he smiled, he grinned, then he slapped\nhis thigh and haw-hawed.\n\n\"No!\" roared Uncle Billy. \"No, there wasn't, by gum!\"\n\n\"Nothing but the house?\"\n\n\"His very own words!\" chuckled Uncle Billy. \"'Jis' th' mere house,'\nsays he, an' he gits it. A bargain's a bargain, an' I allus stick to\none I make.\"\n\n\"How much for the furniture for the week?\"\n\n\"Fifty dollars!\" Mr. Tutt knew how to do business with this kind of\npeople now, you bet.\n\nMr. Van Kamp promptly counted out the money.\n\n\"Drat it!\" commented Uncle Billy to himself. \"I could 'a' got more!\"\n\n\"Now where can we make ourselves comfortable with this furniture?\"\n\nUncle Billy chirked up. All was not yet lost.\n\n\"Waal,\" he reflectively drawled, \"there's th' new barn. It hain't been\nused for nothin' yit, senct I built it two years ago. I jis' hadn't\nth' heart t' put th' critters in it as long as th' ole one stood up.\"\n\nThe other smiled at this flashlight on Uncle Billy's character, and\nthey went out to look at the barn.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nUncle Billy came back from the \"Tutt House Annex,\" as Mr. Van Kamp\ndubbed the barn, with enough more money to make him love all the world\nuntil he got used to having it. Uncle Billy belongs to a large family.\n\nMr. Van Kamp joined the women on the porch, and explained the\nattractively novel situation to them. They were chatting gaily when\nthe Ellsworths came down the stairs. Mr. Ellsworth paused for a moment\nto exchange a word with Uncle Billy.\n\n\"Mr. Tutt,\" said he, laughing, \"if we go for a bit of exercise will\nyou guarantee us the possession of our rooms when we come back?\"\n\n\"Yes sir-ree!\" Uncle Billy assured him. \"They shan't nobody take them\nrooms away from you fer money, marbles, ner chalk. A bargain's a\nbargain, an' I allus stick to one I make,\" and he virtuously took a\nchew of tobacco while he inspected the afternoon sky with a clear\nconscience.\n\n\"I want to get some of those splendid autumn leaves to decorate our\ncozy apartments,\" Mrs. Ellsworth told her husband as they passed in\nhearing of the Van Kamps. \"Do you know those oldtime rag rugs are the\nmost oddly decorative effects that I have ever seen. They are so rich\nin color and so exquisitely blended.\"\n\nThere were reasons why this poisoned arrow failed to rankle, but the\nVan Kamps did not trouble to explain. They were waiting for Ralph to\ncome out and join his parents. Ralph, it seemed, however, had decided\nnot to take a walk. He had already fatigued himself, he had explained,\nand his mother had favored him with a significant look. She could\nreadily believe him, she had assured him, and had then left him in\nscorn.\n\nThe Van Kamps went out to consider the arrangement of the barn. Evelyn\nreturned first and came out on the porch to find a handkerchief. It\nwas not there, but Ralph was. She was very much surprised to see him,\nand she intimated as much.\n\n\"It's dreadfully damp in the woods,\" he explained. \"By the way, you\ndon't happen to know the Whitleys, of Washington, do you? Most\nexcellent people.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sorry that I do not,\" she replied. \"But you will have to\nexcuse me. We shall be kept very busy with arranging our apartments.\"\n\nRalph sprang to his feet with a ludicrous expression.\n\n\"Not the second floor front suite!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, no! Not at all,\" she reassured him.\n\nHe laughed lightly.\n\n\"Honors are about even in that game,\" he said.\n\n\"Evelyn,\" called her mother from the hall. \"Please come and take those\nfront suite curtains down to the barn.\"\n\n\"Pardon me while we take the next trick,\" remarked Evelyn with a laugh\nquite as light and gleeful as his own, and disappeared into the hall.\n\nHe followed her slowly, and was met at the door by her father.\n\n\"You are the younger Mr. Ellsworth, I believe,\" politely said Mr. Van\nKamp.\n\n\"Ralph Ellsworth. Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Here is a note for your father. It is unsealed. You are quite at\nliberty to read it.\"\n\nMr. Van Kamp bowed himself away, and Ralph opened the note, which\nread:\n\nEDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH, ESQ.,\n\nDear Sir: This is to notify you that I have rented the entire\nfurniture of the Tutt House for the ensuing week, and am compelled to\nassume possession of that in the three second floor front rooms, as\nwell as all the balance not in actual use by Mr. and Mrs. Tutt and the\ndriver of the stage. You are quite welcome, however, to make use of\nthe furnishings in the small room over the kitchen. Your luggage you\nwill find undisturbed. Regretting any inconvenience that this\ntransaction may cause you, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. BELMONT VAN KAMP.\n\nRalph scratched his head in amused perplexity. It devolved upon him to\neven up the affair a little before his mother came back. He must\nsupport the family reputation for resourcefulness, but it took quite a\nbit of scalp irritation before he aggravated the right idea into\nbeing. As soon as the idea came, he went in and made a hide-bound\nbargain with Uncle Billy, then he went out into the hall and waited\nuntil Evelyn came down with a huge armload of window curtains.\n\n\"Honors are still even,\" he remarked. \"I have just bought all the\nedibles about the place, whether in the cellar, the house or any of\nthe surrounding structures, in the ground, above the ground, dead or\nalive, and a bargain's a bargain as between man and man.\"\n\n\"Clever of you, I'm sure,\" commented Miss Van Kamp, reflectively.\nSuddenly her lips parted with a smile that revealed a double row of\nmost beautiful teeth. He meditatively watched the curve of her lips.\n\n\"Isn't that rather a heavy load?\" he suggested. \"I'd be delighted to\nhelp you move the things, don't you know.\"\n\n\"It is quite kind of you, and what the men would call 'game,' I\nbelieve, under the circumstances,\" she answered, \"but really it will\nnot be necessary. We have hired Mr. Tutt and the driver to do the\nheavier part of the work, and the rest of it will be really a pleasant\ndiversion.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" agreed Ralph, with an appreciative grin. \"By the way, you\ndon't happen to know Maud and Dorothy Partridge, of Baltimore, do you?\nStunning pretty girls, both of them, and no end of swells.\"\n\n\"I know so very few people in Baltimore,\" she murmured, and tripped on\ndown to the barn.\n\nRalph went out on the porch and smoked. There was nothing else that he\ncould do.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nIt was growing dusk when the elder Ellsworths returned, almost hidden\nby great masses of autumn boughs.\n\n\"You should have been with us, Ralph,\" enthusiastically said his\nmother. \"I never saw such gorgeous tints in all my life. We have\nbrought nearly the entire woods with us.\"\n\n\"It was a good idea,\" said Ralph. \"A stunning good idea. They may come\nin handy to sleep on.\"\n\nMrs. Ellsworth turned cold.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she gasped.\n\n\"Ralph,\" sternly demanded his father, \"you don't mean to tell us that\nyou let the Van Kamps jockey us out of those rooms after all?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" he airily responded. \"Just come right on up and see.\"\n\nHe led the way into the suite and struck a match. One solitary candle\nhad been left upon the mantel shelf. Ralph thought that this had been\noverlooked, but his mother afterwards set him right about that. Mrs.\nVan Kamp had cleverly left it so that the Ellsworths could see how\ndreadfully bare the place was. One candle in three rooms is drearier\nthan darkness anyhow.\n\nMrs. Ellsworth took in all the desolation, the dismal expanse of the\nnow enormous apartments, the shabby walls, the hideous bright spots\nwhere pictures had hung, the splintered flooring, the great, gaunt\nwindows--and she gave in. She had met with snub after snub, and cut\nafter cut, in her social climb, she had had the cook quit in the\nmiddle of an important dinner, she had had every disconcerting thing\npossible happen to her, but this--this was the last _bale_ of straw.\nShe sat down on a suitcase, in the middle of the biggest room, and\ncried!\n\nRalph, having waited for this, now told about the food transaction,\nand she hastily pushed the last-coming tear back into her eye.\n\n\"Good!\" she cried. \"They will be up here soon. They will be compelled\nto compromise, and they must not find me with red eyes.\"\n\nShe cast a hasty glance around the room, then, in a sudden panic,\nseized the candle and explored the other two. She went wildly out into\nthe hall, back into the little room over the kitchen, downstairs,\neverywhere, and returned in consternation.\n\n\"There's not a single mirror left in the house!\" she moaned.\n\nRalph heartlessly grinned. He could appreciate that this was a\ncharacteristic woman trick, and wondered admiringly whether Evelyn or\nher mother had thought of it. However, this was a time for action.\n\n\"I'll get you some water to bathe your eyes,\" he offered, and ran into\nthe little room over the kitchen to get a pitcher. A cracked\nshaving-mug was the only vessel that had been left, but he hurried\ndown into the yard with it. This was no time for fastidiousness.\n\nHe had barely creaked the pump handle when Mr. Van Kamp hurried up\nfrom the barn.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said Mr. Van Kamp, \"but this water belongs\nto us. My daughter bought it, all that is in the ground, above the\nground, or that may fall from the sky upon these premises.\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nThe mutual siege lasted until after seven o'clock, but it was rather\none-sided. The Van Kamps could drink all the water they liked, it made\nthem no hungrier. If the Ellsworths ate anything, however, they grew\nthirstier, and, moreover, water was necessary if anything worth while\nwas to be cooked. They knew all this, and resisted until Mrs.\nEllsworth was tempted and fell. She ate a sandwich and choked. It was\nheartbreaking, but Ralph had to be sent down with a plate of\nsandwiches and an offer to trade them for water.\n\nHalfway between the pump and the house he met Evelyn coming with a\nsmall pail of the precious fluid. They both stopped stock still; then,\nseeing that it was too late to retreat, both laughed and advanced.\n\n\"Who wins now?\" bantered Ralph as they made the exchange.\n\n\"It looks to me like a misdeal,\" she gaily replied, and was moving\naway when he called her back.\n\n\"You don't happen to know the Gately's, of New York, do you?\" he was\nquite anxious to know.\n\n\"I am truly sorry, but I am acquainted with so few people in New York.\nWe are from Chicago, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said he blankly, and took the water up to the Ellsworth suite.\n\nMrs. Ellsworth cheered up considerably when she heard that Ralph had\nbeen met halfway, but her eyes snapped when he confessed that it was\nMiss Van Kamp who had met him.\n\n\"I hope you are not going to carry on a flirtation with that\noverdressed creature,\" she blazed.\n\n\"Why mother,\" exclaimed Ralph, shocked beyond measure. \"What right\nhave you to accuse either this young lady or myself of flirting?\nFlirting!\"\n\nMrs. Ellsworth suddenly attacked the fire with quite unnecessary\nenergy.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nDown at the barn, the wide threshing floor had been covered with gay\nrag-rugs, and strewn with tables, couches, and chairs in picturesque\nprofusion. Roomy box-stalls had been carpeted deep with clean straw,\ncurtained off with gaudy bed-quilts, and converted into cozy sleeping\napartments. The mow and the stalls had been screened off with lace\ncurtains and blazing counterpanes, and the whole effect was one of\nOriental luxury and splendor. Alas, it was only an \"effect\"! The\nred-hot parlor stove smoked abominably, the pipe carried other smoke\nout through the hawmow window, only to let it blow back again. Chill\ncross-draughts whistled in from cracks too numerous to be stopped up,\nand the miserable Van Kamps could only cough and shiver, and envy the\nTutts and the driver, non-combatants who had been fed two hours\nbefore.\n\nUp in the second floor suite there was a roaring fire in the big\nfireplace, but there was a chill in the room that no mere fire could\ndrive away--the chill of absolute emptiness.\n\nA man can outlive hardships that would kill a woman, but a woman can\nendure discomforts that would drive a man crazy.\n\nMr. Ellsworth went out to hunt up Uncle Billy, with an especial solace\nin mind. The landlord was not in the house, but the yellow gleam of a\nlantern revealed his presence in the woodshed, and Mr. Ellsworth\nstepped in upon him just as he was pouring something yellow and clear\ninto a tumbler from a big jug that he had just taken from under the\nflooring.\n\n\"How much do you want for that jug and its contents?\" he asked, with a\nsigh of gratitude that this supply had been overlooked.\n\nBefore Mr. Tutt could answer, Mr. Van Kamp hurried in at the door.\n\n\"Wait a moment!\" he cried. \"I want to bid on that!\"\n\n\"This here jug hain't fer sale at no price,\" Uncle Billy emphatically\nannounced, nipping all negotiations right in the bud. \"It's too pesky\nhard to sneak this here licker in past Marge't, but I reckon it's my\ntreat, gents. Ye kin have all ye want.\"\n\nOne minute later Mr. Van Kamp and Mr. Ellsworth were seated, one on a\nsawbuck and the other on a nail-keg, comfortably eyeing each other\nacross the work bench, and each was holding up a tumbler one-third\nfilled with the golden yellow liquid.\n\n\"Your health, sir,\" courteously proposed Mr. Ellsworth.\n\n\"And to you, sir,\" gravely replied Mr. Van Kamp.\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nRalph and Evelyn happened to meet at the pump, quite accidentally,\nafter the former had made half a dozen five-minute-apart trips for a\ndrink. It was Miss Van Kamp, this time, who had been studying on the\nmutual acquaintance problem.\n\n\"You don't happen to know the Tylers, of Parkersburg, do you?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"The Tylers! I should say I do!\" was the unexpected and enthusiastic\nreply. \"Why, we are on our way now to Miss Georgiana Tyler's wedding\nto my friend Jimmy Carston. I'm to be best man.\"\n\n\"How delightful!\" she exclaimed. \"We are on the way there, too.\nGeorgiana was my dearest chum at school, and I am to be her 'best\ngirl.'\"\n\n\"Let's go around on the porch and sit down,\" said Ralph.\n\n\nXII\n\nMr. Van Kamp, back in the woodshed, looked about him with an eye of\ncontent.\n\n\"Rather cozy for a woodshed,\" he observed. \"I wonder if we couldn't\nscare up a little session of dollar limit?\"\n\nBoth Uncle Billy and Mr. Ellsworth were willing. Death and poker level\nall Americans. A fourth hand was needed, however. The stage driver was\nin bed and asleep, and Mr. Ellsworth volunteered to find the extra\nplayer.\n\n\"I'll get Ralph,\" he said. \"He plays a fairly stiff game.\"  He finally\nfound his son on the porch, apparently alone, and stated his errand.\n\n\"Thank you, but I don't believe I care to play this evening,\" was the\nastounding reply, and Mr. Ellsworth looked closer. He made out, then,\na dim figure on the other side of Ralph.\n\n\"Oh! Of course not!\" he blundered, and went back to the woodshed.\n\nThree-handed poker is a miserable game, and it seldom lasts long. It\ndid not in this case. After Uncle Billy had won the only jack-pot\ndeserving of the name, he was allowed to go blissfully to sleep with\nhis hand on the handle of the big jug.\n\nAfter poker there is only one other always available amusement for\nmen, and that is business. The two travelers were quite well\nacquainted when Ralph put his head in at the door.\n\n\"Thought I'd find you here,\" he explained. \"It just occurred to me to\nwonder whether you gentlemen had discovered, as yet, that we are all\nto be house guests at the Carston-Tyler wedding.\"\n\n\"Why, no!\" exclaimed his father in pleased surprise. \"It is a most\nagreeable coincidence. Mr. Van Kamp, allow me to introduce my son,\nRalph. Mr. Van Kamp and myself, Ralph, have found out that we shall be\nconsiderably thrown together in a business way from now on. He has\njust purchased control of the Metropolitan and Western string of\ninterurbans.\"\n\n\"Delighted, I'm sure,\" murmured Ralph, shaking hands, and then he\nslipped out as quickly as possible. Some one seemed to be waiting for\nhim.\n\nPerhaps another twenty minutes had passed, when one of the men had an\nilluminating idea that resulted, later on, in pleasant relations for\nall of them. It was about time, for Mrs. Ellsworth, up in the bare\nsuite, and Mrs. Van Kamp, down in the draughty barn, both wrapped up\nto the chin and both still chilly, had about reached the limit of\npatience and endurance.\n\n\"Why can't we make things a little more comfortable for all\nconcerned?\" suggested Mr. Van Kamp. \"Suppose, as a starter, that we\nhave Mrs. Van Kamp give a shiver party down in the barn?\"\n\n\"Good idea,\" agreed Mr. Ellsworth. \"A little diplomacy will do it.\nEach one of us will have to tell his wife that the other fellow made\nthe first abject overtures.\"\n\nMr. Van Kamp grinned understandingly, and agreed to the infamous ruse.\n\n\"By the way,\" continued Mr. Ellsworth, with a still happier thought,\n\"you must allow Mrs. Ellsworth to furnish the dinner for Mrs. Van\nKamp's shiver party.\"\n\n\"Dinner!\" gasped Mr. Van Kamp. \"By all means!\"\n\nBoth men felt an anxious yawning in the region of the appetite, and a\nyearning moisture wetted their tongues. They looked at the slumbering\nUncle Billy and decided to see Mrs. Tutt themselves about a good, hot\ndinner for six.\n\n\"Law me!\" exclaimed Aunt Margaret when they appeared at the kitchen\ndoor. \"I swan I thought you folks 'u'd never come to yore senses. Here\nI've had a big pot o' stewed chicken ready on the stove fer two mortal\nhours. I kin give ye that, an' smashed taters an' chicken gravy, an'\ndried corn, an' hot corn-pone, an' currant jell, an' strawberry\npreserves, an' my own cannin' o' peaches, an' pumpkin-pie an' coffee.\nWill that do ye?\" Would it _do_! _Would_ it do!!\n\nAs Aunt Margaret talked, the kitchen door swung wide, and the two men\nwere stricken speechless with astonishment. There, across from each\nother at the kitchen table, sat the utterly selfish and traitorous\nyounger members of the rival houses of Ellsworth and Van Kamp, deep in\nthe joys of chicken, and mashed potatoes, and gravy, and hot\ncorn-pone, and all the other \"fixings,\" laughing and chatting gaily\nlike chums of years' standing. They had seemingly just come to an\nagreement about something or other, for Evelyn, waving the shorter end\nof a broken wishbone, was vivaciously saying to Ralph:\n\n\"A bargain's a bargain, and I always stick to one I make.\"\n\n\n\nA CALL\n\nBy Grace MacGowan Cooke (1863- )\n\n[From _Harper's Magazine_, August, 1906. Copyright, 1906, by Harper &\nBrothers. Republished by the author's permission.]\n\nA boy in an unnaturally clean, country-laundered collar walked down a\nlong white road. He scuffed the dust up wantonly, for he wished to\nveil the all-too-brilliant polish of his cowhide shoes. Also the\nmemory of the whiteness and slipperiness of his collar oppressed him.\nHe was fain to look like one accustomed to social diversions, a man\nhurried from hall to hall of pleasure, without time between to change\ncollar or polish boot. He stooped and rubbed a crumb of earth on his\noverfresh neck-linen.\n\nThis did not long sustain his drooping spirit. He was mentally adrift\nupon the _Hints and Helps to Young Men in Business and Social\nRelations_, which had suggested to him his present enterprise, when\nthe appearance of a second youth, taller and broader than himself,\nwith a shock of light curling hair and a crop of freckles that\nadvertised a rich soil threw him a lifeline. He put his thumbs to his\nlips and whistled in a peculiarly ear-splitting way. The two boys had\nsat on the same bench at Sunday-school not three hours before; yet\nwhat a change had come over the world for one of them since then!\n\n\"Hello! Where you goin', Ab?\" asked the newcomer, gruffly.\n\n\"Callin',\" replied the boy in the collar, laconically, but with\ncarefully averted gaze.\n\n\"On the girls?\" inquired the other, awestruck. In Mount Pisgah you saw\nthe girls home from night church, socials, or parties; you could hang\nover the gate; and you might walk with a girl in the cemetery of a\nSunday afternoon; but to ring a front-door bell and ask for Miss\nHeart's Desire one must have been in long trousers at least three\nyears--and the two boys confronted in the dusty road had worn these\ndignifying garments barely six months.\n\n\"Girls,\" said Abner, loftily; \"I don't know about girls--I'm just\ngoing to call on one girl--Champe Claiborne.\" He marched on as though\nthe conversation was at an end; but Ross hung upon his flank. Ross and\nChampe were neighbors, comrades in all sorts of mischief; he was in\ndoubt whether to halt Abner and pummel him, or propose to enlist under\nhis banner.\n\n\"Do you reckon you could?\" he debated, trotting along by the\nirresponsive Jilton boy.\n\n\"Run home to your mother,\" growled the originator of the plan,\nsavagely. \"You ain't old enough to call on girls; anybody can see\nthat; but I am, and I'm going to call on Champe Claiborne.\"\n\nAgain the name acted as a spur on Ross. \"With your collar and boots\nall dirty?\" he jeered. \"They won't know you're callin'.\"\n\nThe boy in the road stopped short in his dusty tracks. He was an\nintense creature, and he whitened at the tragic insinuation, longing\nfor the wholesome stay and companionship of freckle-faced Ross. \"I put\nthe dirt on o' purpose so's to look kind of careless,\" he half\nwhispered, in an agony of doubt. \"S'pose I'd better go into your house\nand try to wash it off? Reckon your mother would let me?\"\n\n\"I've got two clean collars,\" announced the other boy, proudly\ngenerous. \"I'll lend you one. You can put it on while I'm getting\nready. I'll tell mother that we're just stepping out to do a little\ncalling on the girls.\"\n\nHere was an ally worthy of the cause. Abner welcomed him, in spite of\ncertain jealous twinges. He reflected with satisfaction that there\nwere two Claiborne girls, and though Alicia was so stiff and prim that\nno boy would ever think of calling on her, there was still the hope\nthat she might draw Ross's fire, and leave him, Abner, to make the\nnumerous remarks he had stored up in his mind from _Hints and Helps to\nYoung Men in Social and Business Relations_ to Champe alone.\n\nMrs. Pryor received them with the easy-going kindness of the mother of\none son. She followed them into the dining-room to kiss and feed him,\nwith an absent \"Howdy, Abner; how's your mother?\"\n\nAbner, big with the importance of their mutual intention, inclined his\nhead stiffly and looked toward Ross for explanation. He trembled a\nlittle, but it was with delight, as he anticipated the effect of the\nspeech Ross had outlined. But it did not come.\n\n\"I'm not hungry, mother,\" was the revised edition which the\nfreckle-faced boy offered to the maternal ear. \"I--we are going over\nto Mr. Claiborne's--on--er--on an errand for Abner's father.\"\n\nThe black-eyed boy looked reproach as they clattered up the stairs to\nRoss's room, where the clean collar was produced and a small stock of\nties.\n\n\"You'd wear a necktie--wouldn't you?\" Ross asked, spreading them upon\nthe bureau-top.\n\n\"Yes. But make it fall carelessly over your shirt-front,\" advised the\nstudent of _Hints and Helps_. \"Your collar is miles too big for me.\nSay! I've got a wad of white chewing-gum; would you flat it out and\nstick it over the collar button? Maybe that would fill up some. You\nkick my foot if you see me turning my head so's to knock it off.\"\n\n\"Better button up your vest,\" cautioned Ross, laboring with the\n\"careless\" fall of his tie.\n\n\"Huh-uh! I want 'that easy air which presupposes familiarity with\nsociety'--that's what it says in my book,\" objected Abner.\n\n\"Sure!\" Ross returned to his more familiar jeering attitude. \"Loosen\nup all your clothes, then. Why don't you untie your shoes? Flop a sock\ndown over one of 'em--that looks 'easy' all right.\"\n\nAbner buttoned his vest. \"It gives a man lots of confidence to know\nhe's good-looking,\" he remarked, taking all the room in front of the\nmirror.\n\nRoss, at the wash-stand soaking his hair to get the curl out of it,\ngrumbled some unintelligible response. The two boys went down the\nstairs with tremulous hearts.\n\n\"Why, you've put on another clean shirt, Rossie!\" Mrs. Pryor called\nfrom her chair--mothers' eyes can see so far! \"Well--don't get into\nany dirty play and soil it.\" The boys walked in silence--but it was a\npregnant silence; for as the roof of the Claiborne house began to peer\nabove the crest of the hill, Ross plumped down on a stone and\nannounced, \"I ain't goin'.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" urged the black-eyed boy. \"It'll be fun--and everybody will\nrespect us more. Champe won't throw rocks at us in recess-time, after\nwe've called on her. She couldn't.\"\n\n\"Called!\" grunted Ross. \"I couldn't make a call any more than a cow.\nWhat'd I say? What'd I do? I can behave all right when you just go to\npeople's houses--but a call!\"\n\nAbner hesitated. Should he give away his brilliant inside information,\ndrawn from the _Hints and Helps_ book, and be rivalled in the glory of\nhis manners and bearing? Why should he not pass on alone, perfectly\ncomposed, and reap the field of glory unsupported? His knees gave way\nand he sat down without intending it.\n\n\"Don't you tell anybody and I'll put you on to exactly what grown-up\ngentlemen say and do when they go calling on the girls,\" he began.\n\n\"Fire away,\" retorted Ross, gloomily. \"Nobody will find out from me.\nDead men tell no tales. If I'm fool enough to go, I don't expect to\ncome out of it alive.\"\n\nAbner rose, white and shaking, and thrusting three fingers into the\nbuttoning of his vest, extending the other hand like an orator,\nproceeded to instruct the freckled, perspiring disciple at his feet.\n\n\"'Hang your hat on the rack, or give it to a servant.'\" Ross nodded\nintelligently. He could do that.\n\n\"'Let your legs be gracefully disposed, one hand on the knee, the\nother--'\"\n\nAbner came to an unhappy pause. \"I forget what a fellow does with the\nother hand. Might stick it in your pocket, loudly, or expectorate on\nthe carpet. Indulge in little frivolity. Let a rich stream of\nconversation flow.'\"\n\nRoss mentally dug within himself for sources of rich streams of\nconversation. He found a dry soil. \"What you goin' to talk about?\" he\ndemanded, fretfully. \"I won't go a step farther till I know what I'm\ngoin' to say when I get there.\"\n\nAbner began to repeat paragraphs from _Hints and Helps_. \"'It is best\nto remark,'\" he opened, in an unnatural voice, \"'How well you are\nlooking!' although fulsome compliments should be avoided. When seated\nask the young lady who her favorite composer is.'\"\n\n\"What's a composer?\" inquired Ross, with visions of soothing-syrup in\nhis mind.\n\n\"A man that makes up music. Don't butt in that way; you put me all\nout--'composer is. Name yours. Ask her what piece of music she likes\nbest. Name yours. If the lady is musical, here ask her to play or\nsing.'\"\n\nThis chanted recitation seemed to have a hypnotic effect on the\nfreckled boy; his big pupils contracted each time Abner came to the\nrepetend, \"Name yours.\"\n\n\"I'm tired already,\" he grumbled; but some spell made him rise and\nfare farther.\n\nWhen they had entered the Claiborne gate, they leaned toward each\nother like young saplings weakened at the root and locking branches to\nkeep what shallow foothold on earth remained.\n\n\"You're goin' in first,\" asserted Ross, but without conviction. It was\nhis custom to tear up to this house a dozen times a week, on his\nfather's old horse or afoot; he was wont to yell for Champe as he\napproached, and quarrel joyously with her while he performed such\nerrand as he had come upon; but he was gagged and hamstrung now by the\nhypnotism of Abner's scheme.\n\n\"'Walk quietly up the steps; ring the bell and lay your card on the\nservant,'\" quoted Abner, who had never heard of a server.\n\n\"'Lay your card on the servant!'\" echoed Ross. \"Cady'd dodge. There's\na porch to cross after you go up the steps--does it say anything about\nthat?\"\n\n\"It says that the card should be placed on the servant,\" Abner\nreiterated, doggedly. \"If Cady dodges, it ain't any business of mine.\nThere are no porches in my book. Just walk across it like anybody.\nWe'll ask for Miss Champe Claiborne.\"\n\n\"We haven't got any cards,\" discovered Ross, with hope.\n\n\"I have,\" announced Abner, pompously. \"I had some struck off in\nChicago. I ordered 'em by mail. They got my name Pillow, but there's a\nscalloped gilt border around it. You can write your name on my card.\nGot a pencil?\"\n\nHe produced the bit of cardboard; Ross fished up a chewed stump of\nlead pencil, took it in cold, stiff fingers, and disfigured the square\nwith eccentric scribblings.\n\n\"They'll know who it's meant for,\" he said, apologetically, \"because\nI'm here. What's likely to happen after we get rid of the card?\"\n\n\"I told you about hanging your hat on the rack and disposing your\nlegs.\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" sighed Ross. They had been going slower and slower.\nThe angle of inclination toward each other became more and more\npronounced.\n\n\"We must stand by each other,\" whispered Abner.\n\n\"I will--if I can stand at all,\" murmured the other boy, huskily.\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" They had rounded the big clump of evergreens and found\nAunt Missouri Claiborne placidly rocking on the front porch! Directed\nto mount steps and ring bell, to lay cards upon the servant, how\nshould one deal with a rosy-faced, plump lady of uncertain years in a\nrocking-chair. What should a caller lay upon her? A lion in the way\ncould not have been more terrifying. Even retreat was cut off. Aunt\nMissouri had seen them. \"Howdy, boys; how are you?\" she said, rocking\npeacefully. The two stood before her like detected criminals.\n\nThen, to Ross's dismay, Abner sank down on the lowest step of the\nporch, the westering sun full in his hopeless eyes. He sat on his cap.\nIt was characteristic that the freckled boy remained standing. He\nwould walk up those steps according to plan and agreement, if at all.\nHe accepted no compromise. Folding his straw hat into a battered cone,\nhe watched anxiously for the delivery of the card. He was not sure\nwhat Aunt Missouri's attitude might be if it were laid on her. He bent\ndown to his companion. \"Go ahead,\" he whispered. \"Lay the card.\"\n\nAbner raised appealing eyes. \"In a minute. Give me time,\" he pleaded.\n\n\"Mars' Ross--Mars' Ross! Head 'em off!\" sounded a yell, and Babe, the\nhouse-boy, came around the porch in pursuit of two half-grown\nchickens.\n\n\"Help him, Rossie,\" prompted Aunt Missouri, sharply. \"You boys can\nstay to supper and have some of the chicken if you help catch them.\"\n\nHad Ross taken time to think, he might have reflected that gentlemen\nmaking formal calls seldom join in a chase after the main dish of the\nfamily supper. But the needs of Babe were instant. The lad flung\nhimself sidewise, caught one chicken in his hat, while Babe fell upon\nthe other in the manner of a football player. Ross handed the pullet\nto the house-boy, fearing that he had done something very much out of\ncharacter, then pulled the reluctant negro toward to the steps.\n\n\"Babe's a servant,\" he whispered to Abner, who had sat rigid through\nthe entire performance. \"I helped him with the chickens, and he's got\nto stand gentle while you lay the card on.\"\n\nConfronted by the act itself, Abner was suddenly aware that he knew\nnot how to begin. He took refuge in dissimulation.\n\n\"Hush!\" he whispered back. \"Don't you see Mr. Claiborne's come\nout?--He's going to read something to us.\"\n\nRoss plumped down beside him. \"Never mind the card; tell 'em,\" he\nurged.\n\n\"Tell 'em yourself.\"\n\n\"No--let's cut and run.\"\n\n\"I--I think the worst of it is over. When Champe sees us she'll--\"\n\nMention of Champe stiffened Ross's spine. If it had been glorious to\ncall upon her, how very terrible she would make it should they attempt\ncalling, fail, and the failure come to her knowledge! Some things were\neasier to endure than others; he resolved to stay till the call was\nmade.\n\nFor half an hour the boys sat with drooping heads, and the old\ngentleman read aloud, presumably to Aunt Missouri and themselves.\nFinally their restless eyes discerned the two Claiborne girls walking\nserene in Sunday trim under the trees at the edge of the lawn. Arms\nentwined, they were whispering together and giggling a little. A\ncaller, Ross dared not use his voice to shout nor his legs to run\ntoward them.\n\n\"Why don't you go and talk to the girls, Rossie?\" Aunt Missouri asked,\nin the kindness of her heart. \"Don't be noisy--it's Sunday, you\nknow--and don't get to playing anything that'll dirty up your good\nclothes.\"\n\nRoss pressed his lips hard together; his heart swelled with the rage\nof the misunderstood. Had the card been in his possession, he would,\nat that instant, have laid it on Aunt Missouri without a qualm.\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded the old gentleman, a bit testily.\n\n\"The girls want to hear you read, father,\" said Aunt Missouri,\nshrewdly; and she got up and trotted on short, fat ankles to the girls\nin the arbor. The three returned together, Alicia casting curious\nglances at the uncomfortable youths, Champe threatening to burst into\ngiggles with every breath.\n\nAbner sat hard on his cap and blushed silently. Ross twisted his hat\ninto a three-cornered wreck.\n\nThe two girls settled themselves noisily on the upper step. The old\nman read on and on. The sun sank lower. The hills were red in the west\nas though a brush fire flamed behind their crests. Abner stole a\nfurtive glance at his companion in misery, and the dolor of Ross's\ncountenance somewhat assuaged his anguish. The freckle-faced boy was\nthinking of the village over the hill, a certain pleasant white house\nset back in a green yard, past whose gate, the two-plank sidewalk ran.\nHe knew lamps were beginning to wink in the windows of the neighbors\nabout, as though the houses said, \"Our boys are all at home--but Ross\nPryor's out trying to call on the girls, and can't get anybody to\nunderstand it.\" Oh, that he were walking down those two planks,\ndrawing a stick across the pickets, lifting high happy feet which\ncould turn in at that gate! He wouldn't care what the lamps said then.\nHe wouldn't even mind if the whole Claiborne family died laughing at\nhim--if only some power would raise him up from this paralyzing spot\nand put him behind the safe barriers of his own home!\n\nThe old man's voice lapsed into silence; the light was becoming too\ndim for his reading. Aunt Missouri turned and called over her shoulder\ninto the shadows of the big hall: \"You Babe! Go put two extra plates\non the supper-table.\"\n\nThe boys grew red from the tips of their ears, and as far as any one\ncould see under their wilting collars. Abner felt the lump of gum come\nloose and slip down a cold spine. Had their intentions but been known,\nthis inferential invitation would have been most welcome. It was but\nto rise up and thunder out, \"We came to call on the young ladies.\"\n\nThey did not rise. They did not thunder out anything. Babe brought a\nlamp and set it inside the window, and Mr. Claiborne resumed his\nreading. Champe giggled and said that Alicia made her. Alcia drew her\nskirts about her, sniffed, and looked virtuous, and said she didn't\nsee anything funny to laugh at. The supper-bell rang. The family,\nevidently taking it for granted that the boys would follow, went in.\n\nAlone for the first time, Abner gave up. \"This ain't any use,\" he\ncomplained. \"We ain't calling on anybody.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you lay on the card?\" demanded Ross, fiercely. \"Why\ndidn't you say: 'We've-just-dropped-into-call-on-Miss-Champe. It's-a\n-pleasant-evening. We-feel-we-must-be-going,' like you said you would?\nThen we could have lifted our hats and got away decently.\"\n\nAbner showed no resentment.\n\n\"Oh, if it's so easy, why didn't you do it yourself?\" he groaned.\n\n\"Somebody's coming,\" Ross muttered, hoarsely. \"Say it now. Say it\nquick.\"\n\nThe somebody proved to be Aunt Missouri, who advanced only as far as\nthe end of the hall and shouted cheerfully: \"The idea of a growing boy\nnot coming to meals when the bell rings! I thought you two would be in\nthere ahead of us. Come on.\" And clinging to their head-coverings as\nthough these contained some charm whereby the owners might be rescued,\nthe unhappy callers were herded into the dining-room. There were many\nthings on the table that boys like. Both were becoming fairly\ncheerful, when Aunt Missouri checked the biscuit-plate with: \"I treat\nmy neighbors' children just like I'd want children of my own treated.\nIf your mothers let you eat all you want, say so, and I don't care;\nbut if either of them is a little bit particular, why, I'd stop at\nsix!\"\n\nStill reeling from this blow, the boys finally rose from the table and\npassed out with the family, their hats clutched to their bosoms, and\nclinging together for mutual aid and comfort. During the usual\nSunday-evening singing Champe laughed till Aunt Missouri threatened to\nsend her to bed. Abner's card slipped from his hand and dropped face\nup on the floor. He fell upon it and tore it into infinitesimal\npieces.\n\n\"That must have been a love-letter,\" said Aunt Missouri, in a pause of\nthe music. \"You boys are getting 'most old enough to think about\nbeginning to call on the girls.\" Her eyes twinkled.\n\nRoss growled like a stoned cur. Abner took a sudden dive into _Hints\nand Helps_, and came up with, \"You flatter us, Miss Claiborne,\"\nwhereat Ross snickered out like a human boy. They all stared at him.\n\n\"It sounds so funny to call Aunt Missouri 'Mis' Claiborne,'\" the lad\nof the freckles explained.\n\n\"Funny?\" Aunt Missouri reddened. \"I don't see any particular joke in\nmy having my maiden name.\"\n\nAbner, who instantly guessed at what was in Ross's mind, turned white\nat the thought of what they had escaped. Suppose he had laid on the\ncard and asked for Miss Claiborne!\n\n\"What's the matter, Champe?\" inquired Ross, in a fairly natural tone.\nThe air he had drawn into his lungs when he laughed at Abner seemed to\nrelieve him from the numbing gentility which had bound his powers\nsince he joined Abner's ranks.\n\n\"Nothing. I laughed because you laughed,\" said the girl.\n\nThe singing went forward fitfully. Servants traipsed through the\ndarkened yard, going home for Sunday night. Aunt Missouri went out and\nheld some low-toned parley with them. Champe yawned with insulting\nenthusiasm. Presently both girls quietly disappeared. Aunt Missouri\nnever returned to the parlor--evidently thinking that the girls would\nattend to the final amenities with their callers. They were left alone\nwith old Mr. Claiborne. They sat as though bound in their chairs,\nwhile the old man read in silence for a while. Finally he closed his\nbook, glanced about him, and observed absently:\n\n\"So you boys were to spend the night?\" Then, as he looked at their\nstartled faces: \"I'm right, am I not? You are to spent the night?\"\n\nOh, for courage to say: \"Thank you, no. We'll be going now. We just\ncame over to call on Miss Champe.\" But thought of how this would sound\nin face of the facts, the painful realization that they dared not say\nit because they _had_ not said it, locked their lips. Their feet were\nlead; their tongues stiff and too large for their mouths. Like\ncreatures in a nightmare, they moved stiffly, one might have said\ncreakingly, up the stairs and received each--a bedroom candle!\n\n\"Good night, children,\" said the absent-minded old man. The two\ngurgled out some sounds which were intended for words and doged behind\nthe bedroom door.\n\n\"They've put us to bed!\" Abner's black eyes flashed fire. His nervous\nhands clutched at the collar Ross had lent him. \"That's what I get for\ncoming here with you, Ross Pryor!\" And tears of humiliation stood in\nhis eyes.\n\nIn his turn Ross showed no resentment. \"What I'm worried about is my\nmother,\" he confessed. \"She's so sharp about finding out things. She\nwouldn't tease me--she'd just be sorry for me. But she'll think I went\nhome with you.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see my mother make a fuss about my calling on the girls!\"\ngrowled Abner, glad to let his rage take a safe direction.\n\n\"Calling on the girls! Have we called on any girls?\" demanded\nclear-headed, honest Ross.\n\n\"Not exactly--yet,\" admitted Abner, reluctantly. \"Come on--let's go to\nbed. Mr. Claiborne asked us, and he's the head of this household. It\nisn't anybody's business what we came for.\"\n\n\"I'll slip off my shoes and lie down till Babe ties up the dog in the\nmorning,\" said Ross. \"Then we can get away before any of the family is\nup.\"\n\nOh, youth--youth--youth, with its rash promises! Worn out with misery\nthe boys slept heavily. The first sound that either heard in the\nmorning was Babe hammering upon their bedroom door. They crouched\nguiltily and looked into each other's eyes. \"Let pretend we ain't here\nand he'll go away,\" breathed Abner.\n\nBut Babe was made of sterner stuff. He rattled the knob. He turned it.\nHe put in a black face with a grin which divided it from ear to ear.\n\"Cady say I mus' call dem fool boys to breakfus',\" he announced. \"I\nnever named you-all dat. Cady, she say dat.\"\n\n\"Breakfast!\" echoed Ross, in a daze.\n\n\"Yessuh, breakfus',\" reasserted Babe, coming entirely into the room\nand looking curiously about him. \"Ain't you-all done been to bed at\nall?\" wrapping his arms about his shoulders and shaking with silent\necstasies of mirth. The boys threw themselves upon him and ejected\nhim.\n\n\"Sent up a servant to call us to breakfast,\" snarled Abner. \"If they'd\nonly sent their old servant to the door in the first place, all this\nwouldn't 'a' happened. I'm just that way when I get thrown off the\ntrack. You know how it was when I tried to repeat those things to\nyou--I had to go clear back to the beginning when I got interrupted.\"\n\n\"Does that mean that you're still hanging around here to begin over\nand make a call?\" asked Ross, darkly. \"I won't go down to breakfast if\nyou are.\"\n\nAbner brightened a little as he saw Ross becoming wordy in his rage.\n\"I dare you to walk downstairs and say,\n'We-just-dropped-in-to-call-on-Miss-Champe'!\" he said.\n\n\"I--oh--I--darn it all! there goes the second bell. We may as well\ntrot down.\"\n\n\"Don't leave me, Ross,\" pleaded the Jilton boy. \"I can't stay\nhere--and I can't go down.\"\n\nThe tone was hysterical. The boy with freckles took his companion by\nthe arm without another word and marched him down the stairs. \"We may\nget a chance yet to call on Champe all by herself out on the porch or\nin the arbor before she goes to school,\" he suggested, by way of\nputting some spine into the black-eyed boy.\n\nAn emphatic bell rang when they were half-way down the stairs.\nClutching their hats, they slunk into the dining-room. Even Mr.\nClaiborne seemed to notice something unusual in their bearing as they\nsettled into the chairs assigned to them, and asked them kindly if\nthey had slept well.\n\nIt was plain that Aunt Missouri had been posting him as to her\nunderstanding of the intentions of these young men. The state of\naffairs gave an electric hilarity to the atmosphere. Babe travelled\nfrom the sideboard to the table, trembling like chocolate pudding.\nCady insisted on bringing in the cakes herself, and grinned as she\nwhisked her starched blue skirts in and out of the dining-room. A\ndimple even showed itself at the corners of pretty Alicia's prim\nlittle mouth. Champe giggled, till Ross heard Cady whisper:\n\n\"Now you got one dem snickerin' spells agin. You gwine bust yo' dress\nbuttons off in the back ef you don't mind.\"\n\nAs the spirits of those about them mounted, the hearts of the two\nyouths sank--if it was like this among the Claibornes, what would it\nbe at school and in the world at large when their failure to connect\nintention with result became village talk? Ross bit fiercely upon an\nunoffending batter-cake, and resolved to make a call single-handed\nbefore he left the house.\n\nThey went out of the dining-room, their hats as ever pressed to their\nbreasts. With no volition of their own, their uncertain young legs\ncarried them to the porch. The Claiborne family and household followed\nlike small boys after a circus procession. When the two turned, at\nbay, yet with nothing between them and liberty but a hypnotism of\ntheir own suggestion, they saw the black faces of the servants peering\nover the family shoulders.\n\nRoss was the boy to have drawn courage from the desperation of their\ncase, and made some decent if not glorious ending. But at the\npsychological moment there came around the corner of the house that\nmost contemptible figure known to the Southern plantation, a\nshirt-boy--a creature who may be described, for the benefit of those\nnot informed, as a pickaninny clad only in a long, coarse cotton\nshirt. While all eyes were fastened upon him this inglorious\nambassador bolted forth his message:\n\n\"Yo' ma say\"--his eyes were fixed upon Abner--\"ef yo' don' come home,\nshe gwine come after yo'--an' cut yo' into inch pieces wid a rawhide\nwhen she git yo'. Dat jest what Miss Hortense say.\"\n\nAs though such a book as _Hints and Helps_ had never existed, Abner\nshot for the gate--he was but a hobbledehoy fascinated with the idea\nof playing gentleman. But in Ross there were the makings of a man. For\na few half-hearted paces, under the first impulse of horror, he\nfollowed his deserting chief, the laughter of the family, the\nunrestrainable guffaws of the negroes, sounding in the rear. But when\nChampe's high, offensive giggle, topping all the others, insulted his\nears, he stopped dead, wheeled, and ran to the porch faster than he\nhad fled from it. White as paper, shaking with inexpressible rage, he\ncaught and kissed the tittering girl, violently, noisily, before them\nall.\n\nThe negroes fled--they dared not trust their feelings; even Alicia\nsniggered unobtrusively; Grandfather Claiborne chuckled, and Aunt\nMissouri frankly collapsed into her rocking-chair, bubbling with\nmirth, crying out:\n\n\"Good for you, Ross! Seems you did know how to call on the girls,\nafter all.\"\n\nBut Ross, paying no attention, walked swiftly toward the gate. He had\nserved his novitiate. He would never be afraid again. With cheerful\nalacrity he dodged the stones flung after him with friendly, erratic\naim by the girl upon whom, yesterday afternoon, he had come to make a\nsocial call.\n\n\n\nHOW THE WIDOW WON THE DEACON\n\nBy William James Lampton ( -1917)\n\n[From Harper's Bazaar, April, 1911; copyright, 1911, by Harper &\nBrothers; republished by permission.]\n\nOf course the Widow Stimson never tried to win Deacon Hawkins, nor any\nother man, for that matter. A widow doesn't have to try to win a man;\nshe wins without trying. Still, the Widow Stimson sometimes wondered\nwhy the deacon was so blind as not to see how her fine farm adjoining\nhis equally fine place on the outskirts of the town might not be\nbrought under one management with mutual benefit to both parties at\ninterest. Which one that management might become was a matter of\nfuture detail. The widow knew how to run a farm successfully, and a\nlarge farm is not much more difficult to run than one of half the\nsize. She had also had one husband, and knew something more than\nrunning a farm successfully. Of all of which the deacon was perfectly\nwell aware, and still he had not been moved by the merging spirit of\nthe age to propose consolidation.\n\nThis interesting situation was up for discussion at the Wednesday\nafternoon meeting of the Sisters' Sewing Society.\n\n\"For my part,\" Sister Susan Spicer, wife of the Methodist minister,\nremarked as she took another tuck in a fourteen-year-old girl's skirt\nfor a ten-year-old--\"for my part, I can't see why Deacon Hawkins and\nKate Stimson don't see the error of their ways and depart from them.\"\n\n\"I rather guess _she_ has,\" smiled Sister Poteet, the grocer's better\nhalf, who had taken an afternoon off from the store in order to be\npresent.\n\n\"Or is willing to,\" added Sister Maria Cartridge, a spinster still\npossessing faith, hope, and charity, notwithstanding she had been on\nthe waiting list a long time.\n\n\"Really, now,\" exclaimed little Sister Green, the doctor's wife, \"do\nyou think it is the deacon who needs urging?\"\n\n\"It looks that way to me,\" Sister Poteet did not hesitate to affirm.\n\n\"Well, I heard Sister Clark say that she had heard him call her\n'Kitty' one night when they were eating ice-cream at the Mite\nSociety,\" Sister Candish, the druggist's wife, added to the fund of\nreliable information on hand.\n\n\"'Kitty,' indeed!\" protested Sister Spicer. \"The idea of anybody\ncalling Kate Stimson 'Kitty'! The deacon will talk that way to 'most\nany woman, but if she let him say it to her more than once, she must\nbe getting mighty anxious, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Sister Candish hastened to explain, \"Sister Clark didn't say she\nhad heard him say it twice.'\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think she heard him say it once,\" Sister Spicer\nasserted with confidence.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" Sister Poteet argued. \"From all I can see\nand hear I think Kate Stimson wouldn't object to 'most anything the\ndeacon would say to her, knowing as she does that he ain't going to\nsay anything he shouldn't say.\"\n\n\"And isn't saying what he should,\" added Sister Green, with a sly\nsnicker, which went around the room softly.\n\n\"But as I was saying--\" Sister Spicer began, when Sister Poteet, whose\nrocker, near the window, commanded a view of the front gate,\ninterrupted with a warning, \"'Sh-'sh.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I say what I wanted to when--\" Sister Spicer began.\n\n\"There she comes now,\" explained Sister Poteet, \"and as I live the\ndeacon drove her here in his sleigh, and he's waiting while she comes\nin. I wonder what next,\" and Sister Poteet, in conjunction with the\nentire society, gasped and held their eager breaths, awaiting the\nentrance of the subject of conversation.\n\nSister Spicer went to the front door to let her in, and she was\ngreeted with the greatest cordiality by everybody.\n\n\"We were just talking about you and wondering why you were so late\ncoming,\" cried Sister Poteet. \"Now take off your things and make up\nfor lost time. There's a pair of pants over there to be cut down to\nfit that poor little Snithers boy.\"\n\nThe excitement and curiosity of the society were almost more than\ncould be borne, but never a sister let on that she knew the deacon was\nat the gate waiting. Indeed, as far as the widow could discover, there\nwas not the slightest indication that anybody had ever heard there was\nsuch a person as the deacon in existence.\n\n\"Oh,\" she chirruped, in the liveliest of humors, \"you will have to\nexcuse me for today. Deacon Hawkins overtook me on the way here, and\nhere said I had simply got to go sleigh-riding with him. He's waiting\nout at the gate now.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" exclaimed the society unanimously, and rushed to the\nwindow to see if it were really true.\n\n\"Well, did you ever?\" commented Sister Poteet, generally.\n\n\"Hardly ever,\" laughed the widow, good-naturedly, \"and I don't want to\nlose the chance. You know Deacon Hawkins isn't asking somebody every\nday to go sleighing with him. I told him I'd go if he would bring me\naround here to let you know what had become of me, and so he did. Now,\ngood-by, and I'll be sure to be present at the next meeting. I have to\nhurry because he'll get fidgety.\"\n\nThe widow ran away like a lively schoolgirl. All the sisters watched\nher get into the sleigh with the deacon, and resumed the previous\ndiscussion with greatly increased interest.\n\nBut little recked the widow and less recked the deacon. He had bought\na new horse and he wanted the widow's opinion of it, for the Widow\nStimson was a competent judge of fine horseflesh. If Deacon Hawkins\nhad one insatiable ambition it was to own a horse which could fling\nits heels in the face of the best that Squire Hopkins drove. In his\nearly manhood the deacon was no deacon by a great deal. But as the\nyears gathered in behind him he put off most of the frivolities of\nyouth and held now only to the one of driving a fast horse. No other\nman in the county drove anything faster except Squire Hopkins, and him\nthe deacon had not been able to throw the dust over. The deacon would\nget good ones, but somehow never could he find one that the squire\ndidn't get a better. The squire had also in the early days beaten the\ndeacon in the race for a certain pretty girl he dreamed about. But the\ngirl and the squire had lived happily ever after and the deacon, being\na philosopher, might have forgotten the squire's superiority had it\nbeen manifested in this one regard only. But in horses, too--that\ngraveled the deacon.\n\n\"How much did you give for him?\" was the widow's first query, after\nthey had reached a stretch of road that was good going and the deacon\nhad let him out for a length or two.\n\n\"Well, what do you suppose? You're a judge.\"\n\n\"More than I would give, I'll bet a cookie.\"\n\n\"Not if you was as anxious as I am to show Hopkins that he can't drive\nby everything on the pike.\"\n\n\"I thought you loved a good horse because he was a good horse,\" said\nthe widow, rather disapprovingly.\n\n\"I do, but I could love him a good deal harder if he would stay in\nfront of Hopkins's best.\"\n\n\"Does he know you've got this one?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he's been blowing round town that he is waiting to pick me\nup on the road some day and make my five hundred dollars look like a\npewter quarter.\"\n\n\"So you gave five hundred dollars for him, did you?\" laughed the\nwidow.\n\n\"Is it too much?\"\n\n\"Um-er,\" hesitated the widow, glancing along the graceful lines of the\npowerful trotter, \"I suppose not if you can beat the squire.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" crowed the deacon, \"and I'll show him a thing or two\nin getting over the ground,\" he added with swelling pride.\n\n\"Well, I hope he won't be out looking for you today, with me in your\nsleigh,\" said the widow, almost apprehensively, \"because, you know,\ndeacon, I have always wanted you to beat Squire Hopkins.\"\n\nThe deacon looked at her sharply. There was a softness in her tones\nthat appealed to him, even if she had not expressed such agreeable\nsentiments. Just what the deacon might have said or done after the\nimpulse had been set going must remain unknown, for at the crucial\nmoment a sound of militant bells, bells of defiance, jangled up behind\nthem, disturbing their personal absorption, and they looked around\nsimultaneously. Behind the bells was the squire in his sleigh drawn by\nhis fastest stepper, and he was alone, as the deacon was not. The\nwidow weighed one hundred and sixty pounds, net--which is weighting a\nhorse in a race rather more than the law allows.\n\nBut the deacon never thought of that. Forgetting everything except his\ncherished ambition, he braced himself for the contest, took a twist\nhold on the lines, sent a sharp, quick call to his horse, and let him\nout for all that was in him. The squire followed suit and the deacon.\nThe road was wide and the snow was worn down smooth. The track\ncouldn't have been in better condition. The Hopkins colors were not\nfive rods behind the Hawkins colors as they got away. For half a mile\nit was nip and tuck, the deacon encouraging his horse and the widow\nencouraging the deacon, and then the squire began creeping up. The\ndeacon's horse was a good one, but he was not accustomed to hauling\nfreight in a race. A half-mile of it was as much as he could stand,\nand he weakened under the strain.\n\nNot handicapped, the squire's horse forged ahead, and as his nose\npushed up to the dashboard of the deacon's sleigh, that good man\ngroaned in agonized disappointment and bitterness of spirit. The widow\nwas mad all over that Squire Hopkins should take such a mean advantage\nof his rival. Why didn't he wait till another time when the deacon was\nalone, as he was? If she had her way she never would, speak to Squire\nHopkins again, nor to his wife, either. But her resentment was not\nhelping the deacon's horse to win.\n\nSlowly the squire pulled closer to the front; the deacon's horse,\nrealizing what it meant to his master and to him, spurted bravely,\nbut, struggle as gamely as he might, the odds were too many for him,\nand he dropped to the rear. The squire shouted in triumph as he drew\npast the deacon, and the dejected Hawkins shrivelled into a heap on\nthe seat, with only his hands sufficiently alive to hold the lines. He\nhad been beaten again, humiliated before a woman, and that, too, with\nthe best horse that he could hope to put against the ever-conquering\nsquire. Here sank his fondest hopes, here ended his ambition. From\nthis on he would drive a mule or an automobile. The fruit of his\ndesire had turned to ashes in his mouth.\n\nBut no. What of the widow? She realized, if the deacon did not, that\nshe, not the squire's horse, had beaten the deacon's, and she was\nready to make what atonement she could. As the squire passed ahead of\nthe deacon she was stirred by a noble resolve. A deep bed of drifted\nsnow lay close by the side of the road not far in front. It was soft\nand safe and she smiled as she looked at it as though waiting for her.\nWithout a hint of her purpose, or a sign to disturb the deacon in his\nfinal throes, she rose as the sleigh ran near its edge, and with a\nspring which had many a time sent her lightly from the ground to the\nbare back of a horse in the meadow, she cleared the robes and lit\nplump in the drift. The deacon's horse knew before the deacon did that\nsomething had happened in his favor, and was quick to respond. With\nhis first jump of relief the deacon suddenly revived, his hopes came\nfast again, his blood retingled, he gathered himself, and, cracking\nhis lines, he shot forward, and three minutes later he had passed the\nsquire as though he were hitched to the fence. For a quarter of a mile\nthe squire made heroic efforts to recover his vanished prestige, but\neffort was useless, and finally concluding that he was practically\nleft standing, he veered off from the main road down a farm lane to\nfind some spot in which to hide the humiliation of his defeat. The\ndeacon, still going at a clipping gait, had one eye over his shoulder\nas wary drivers always have on such occasions, and when he saw the\nsquire was off the track he slowed down and jogged along with the\napparent intention of continuing indefinitely. Presently an idea\nstruck him, and he looked around for the widow. She was not where he\nhad seen her last. Where was she? In the enthusiasm of victory he had\nforgotten her. He was so dejected at the moment she had leaped that he\ndid not realize what she had done, and two minutes later he was so\nelated that, shame on him! he did not care. With her, all was lost;\nwithout her, all was won, and the deacon's greatest ambition was to\nwin. But now, with victory perched on his horse-collar, success his at\nlast, he thought of the widow, and he did care. He cared so much that\nhe almost threw his horse off his feet by the abrupt turn he gave him,\nand back down the pike he flew as if a legion of squires were after\nhim.\n\nHe did not know what injury she might have sustained; She might have\nbeen seriously hurt, if not actually killed. And why? Simply to make\nit possible for him to win. The deacon shivered as he thought of it,\nand urged his horse to greater speed. The squire, down the lane, saw\nhim whizzing along and accepted it profanely as an exhibition for his\nespecial benefit. The deacon now had forgotten the squire as he had\nonly so shortly before forgotten the widow. Two hundred yards from the\ndrift into which she had jumped there was a turn in the road, where\nsome trees shut off the sight, and the deacon's anxiety increased\nmomentarily until he reached this point. From here he could see ahead,\nand down there in the middle of the road stood the widow waving her\nshawl as a banner of triumph, though she could only guess at results.\nThe deacon came on with a rush, and pulled up alongside of her in a\ncondition of nervousness he didn't think possible to him.\n\n\"Hooray! hooray!\" shouted the widow, tossing her shawl into the air.\n\"You beat him. I know you did. Didn't you? I saw you pulling ahead at\nthe turn yonder. Where is he and his old plug?\"\n\n\"Oh, bother take him and his horse and the race and everything. Are\nyou hurt?\" gasped the deacon, jumping out, but mindful to keep the\nlines in his hand. \"Are you hurt?\" he repeated, anxiously, though she\nlooked anything but a hurt woman.\n\n\"If I am,\" she chirped, cheerily, \"I'm not hurt half as bad as I would\nhave been if the squire had beat you, deacon. Now don't you worry\nabout me. Let's hurry back to town so the squire won't get another\nchance, with no place for me to jump.\"\n\nAnd the deacon? Well, well, with the lines in the crook of his elbow\nthe deacon held out his arms to the widow and----. The sisters at the\nnext meeting of the Sewing Society were unanimously of the opinion\nthat any woman who would risk her life like that for a husband was\nmighty anxious.\n\n\n\nGIDEON\n\nBy Wells Hastings (1878- )\n\n[From _The Century Magazine_, April, 1914; copyright, 1914, by The\nCentury Co.; republished by the author's permission.]\n\n\"An' de next' frawg dat houn' pup seen, he pass him by wide.\"\n\nThe house, which had hung upon every word, roared with laughter, and\nshook with a storming volley of applause. Gideon bowed to right and to\nleft, low, grinning, assured comedy obeisances; but as the laughter\nand applause grew he shook his head, and signaled quietly for the\ndrop. He had answered many encores, and he was an instinctive artist.\nIt was part of the fuel of his vanity that his audience had never yet\nhad enough of him. Dramatic judgment, as well as dramatic sense of\ndelivery, was native to him, qualities which the shrewd Felix Stuhk,\nhis manager and exultant discoverer, recognized and wisely trusted in.\nOff stage Gideon was watched over like a child and a delicate\ninvestment, but once behind the footlights he was allowed to go his\nown triumphant gait.\n\nIt was small wonder that Stuhk deemed himself one of the cleverest\nmanagers in the business; that his narrow, blue-shaven face was\ncontinually chiseled in smiles of complacent self-congratulation. He\nwas rapidly becoming rich, and there were bright prospects of even\ngreater triumphs, with proportionately greater reward. He had made\nGideon a national character, a headliner, a star of the first\nmagnitude in the firmament of the vaudeville theater, and all in six\nshort months. Or, at any rate, he had helped to make him all this; he\nhad booked him well and given him his opportunity. To be sure, Gideon\nhad done the rest; Stuhk was as ready as any one to do credit to\nGideon's ability. Still, after all, he, Stuhk, was the discoverer, the\ntheatrical Columbus who had had the courage and the vision.\n\nA now-hallowed attack of tonsilitis had driven him to Florida, where\npresently Gideon had been employed to beguile his convalescence, and\nguide him over the intricate shallows of that long lagoon known as the\nIndian River in search of various fish. On days when fish had been\nreluctant Gideon had been lured into conversation, and gradually into\nnarrative and the relation of what had appeared to Gideon as humorous\nand entertaining; and finally Felix, the vague idea growing big within\nhim, had one day persuaded his boatman to dance upon the boards of a\nlong pier where they had made fast for lunch. There, with all the\nsudden glory of crystallization, the vague idea took definite form and\nbecame the great inspiration of Stuhk's career.\n\nGideon had grown to be to vaudeville much what _Uncle Remus_ is to\nliterature: there was virtue in his very simplicity. His artistry\nitself was native and natural. He loved a good story, and he told it\nfrom his own sense of the gleeful morsel upon his tongue as no\ntraining could have made him. He always enjoyed his story and himself\nin the telling. Tales never lost their savor, no matter how often\nrepeated; age was powerless to dim the humor of the thing, and as he\nhad shouted and gurgled and laughed over the fun of things when all\nalone, or holding forth among the men and women and little children of\nhis color, so he shouted and gurgled and broke from sonorous chuckles\nto musical, falsetto mirth when he fronted the sweeping tiers of faces\nacross the intoxicating glare of the footlights. He had that rare\npower of transmitting something of his own enjoyments. When Gideon was\non the stage, Stuhk used to enjoy peeping out at the intent, smiling\nfaces of the audience, where men and women and children, hardened\ntheater-goers and folk fresh from the country, sat with moving lips\nand faces lit with an eager interest and sympathy for the black man\nstrutting in loose-footed vivacity before them.\n\n\"He's simply unique,\" he boasted to wondering local managers--\"unique,\nand it took me to find him. There he was, a little black gold-mine,\nand all of 'em passed him by until I came. Some eye? What? I guess\nyou'll admit you have to hand it some to your Uncle Felix. If that\ncoon's health holds out, we'll have all the money there is in the\nmint.\"\n\nThat was Felix's real anxiety--\"If his health holds out.\" Gideon's\nhealth was watched over as if he had been an ailing prince. His\nbubbling vivacity was the foundation upon which his charm and his\nsuccess were built. Stuhk became a sort of vicarious neurotic,\neternally searching for symptoms in his protege; Gideon's tongue,\nGideon's liver, Gideon's heart were matters to him of an unfailing\nand anxious interest. And of late--of course it might be imagination\n--Gideon had shown a little physical falling off. He ate a bit less,\nhe had begun to move in a restless way, and, worst of all, he laughed\nless frequently.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there was ground for Stuhk's apprehension. It was\nnot all a matter of managerial imagination: Gideon was less himself.\nPhysically there was nothing the matter with him; he could have passed\nhis rigid insurance scrutiny as easily as he had done months before,\nwhen his life and health had been insured for a sum that made good\ncopy for his press-agent. He was sound in every organ, but there was\nsomething lacking in general tone. Gideon felt it himself, and was\ncertain that a \"misery,\" that embracing indisposition of his race, was\ncreeping upon him. He had been fed well, too well; he was growing\nrich, too rich; he had all the praise, all the flattery that his\nenormous appetite for approval desired, and too much of it. White men\nsought him out and made much of him; white women talked to him about\nhis career; and wherever he went, women of color--black girls, brown\ngirls, yellow girls--wrote him of their admiration, whispered, when he\nwould listen, of their passion and hero-worship. \"City niggers\" bowed\ndown before him; the high gallery was always packed with them.\nMusk-scented notes scrawled upon barbaric, \"high-toned\" stationery\npoured in upon him. Even a few white women, to his horror and\nembarrassment, had written him of love, letters which he straightway\ndestroyed. His sense of his position was strong in him; he was proud\nof it. There might be \"folks outer their haids,\" but he had the sense\nto remember. For months he had lived in a heaven of gratified vanity,\nbut at last his appetite had begun to falter. He was sated; his soul\nlonged to wipe a spiritual mouth on the back of a spiritual hand, and\nhave done. His face, now that the curtain was down and he was leaving\nthe stage, was doleful, almost sullen.\n\nStuhk met him anxiously in the wings, and walked with him to his\ndressing-room. He felt suddenly very weary of Stuhk.\n\n\"Nothing the matter, Gideon, is there? Not feeling sick or anything?\"\n\n\"No, Misteh Stuhk; no, seh. Jes don' feel extry pert, that's all.\"\n\n\"But what is it--anything bothering you?\"\n\nGideon sat gloomily before his mirror.\n\n\"Misteh Stuhk,\" he said at last, \"I been steddyin' it oveh, and I\nabout come to the delusion that I needs a good po'k-chop. Seems\nfoolish, I know, but it do' seem as if a good po'k-chop, fried jes\nright, would he'p consid'able to disumpate this misery feelin' that's\ncrawlin' and creepin' round my sperit.\"\n\nStuhk laughed.\n\n\"Pork-chop, eh? Is that the best you can think of? I know what you\nmean, though. I've thought for some time that you were getting a\nlittle overtrained. What you need is--let me see--yes, a nice bottle\nof wine. That's the ticket; it will ease things up and won't do you\nany harm. I'll go, with you. Ever had any champagne, Gideon?\"\n\nGideon struggled for politeness.\n\n\"Yes, seh, I's had champagne, and it's a nice kind of lickeh sho\nenough; but, Misteh Stuhk, seh, I don' want any of them high-tone\ndrinks to-night, an' ef yo' don' mind, I'd rather amble off 'lone, or\nmebbe eat that po'k-chop with some otheh cullud man, ef I kin fin' one\nthat ain' one of them no-'count Carolina niggers. Do you s'pose yo'\ncould let me have a little money to-night, Misteh Stuhk?\"\n\nStuhk thought rapidly. Gideon had certainly worked hard, and he was\nnot dissipated. If he wanted to roam the town by himself, there was no\nharm in it. The sullenness still showed in the black face; Heaven knew\nwhat he might do if he suddenly began to balk. Stuhk thought it wise\nto consent gracefully.\n\n\"Good!\" he said. \"Fly to it. How much do you want?\nA hundred?\"\n\n\"How much is coming to me?\"\n\n\"About a thousand, Gideon.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd moughty like five hun'red of it, ef that's 'greeable to\nyo'.\"\n\nFelix whistled.\n\n\"Five hundred? Pork-chops must be coming high. You don't want to carry\nall that money around, do you?\"\n\nGideon did not answer; he looked very gloomy.\n\nStuhk hastened to cheer him.\n\n\"Of course you can have anything you want. Wait a minute, and I will\nget it for you.\n\n\"I'll bet that coon's going to buy himself a ring or something,\" he\nreflected as he went in search of the local manager and Gideon's\nmoney.\n\nBut Stuhk was wrong. Gideon had no intention of buying himself a ring.\nFor the matter of that, he had several that were amply satisfactory.\nThey had size and sparkle and luster, all the diamond brilliance that\nrings need to have; and for none of them had he paid much over five\ndollars. He was amply supplied with jewelry in which he felt perfect\nsatisfaction. His present want was positive, if nebulous; he desired a\nfortune in his pocket, bulky, tangible evidence of his miraculous\nsuccess. Ever since Stuhk had found him, life had had an unreal\nquality for him. His Monte Cristo wealth was too much like a fabulous,\ndream-found treasure, money that could not be spent without danger of\nawakening. And he had dropped into the habit of storing it about him,\nso that in any pocket into which he plunged his hand he might find a\nroll of crisp evidence of reality. He liked his bills to be of all\ndenominations, and some so large as exquisitely to stagger\nimagination, others charming by their number and crispness--the\ndignified, orange paper of a man of assured position and\nwealth-crackling greenbacks the design of which tinged the whole with\nactuality. He was specially partial to engravings of President\nLincoln, the particular savior and patron of his race. This five\nhundred dollars he was adding to an unreckoned sum of about two\nthousand, merely as extra fortification against a growing sense of\ngloom. He wished to brace his flagging spirits with the gay wine of\npossession, and he was glad, when the money came, that it was in an\nelastic-bound roll, so bulky that it was pleasantly uncomfortable in\nhis pocket as he left his manager.\n\nAs he turned into the brilliantly lighted street from the somber\nalleyway of the stage entrance, he paused for a moment to glance at\nhis own name, in three-foot letters of red, before the doors of the\ntheater. He could read, and the large block type always pleased him.\n\"THIS WEEK: GIDEON.\" That was all. None of the fulsome praise, the\nsuperlative, necessary definition given to lesser performers. He had\nbeen, he remembered, \"GIDEON, America's Foremost Native Comedian,\" a\ntitle that was at once boast and challenge. That necessity was now\npast, for he was a national character; any explanatory qualification\nwould have been an insult to the public intelligence. To the world he\nwas just \"Gideon\"; that was enough. It gave him pleasure, as he\nsauntered along, to see the announcement repeated on window cards and\nhoardings.\n\nPresently he came to a window before which he paused in delighted\nwonder. It was not a large window; to the casual eye of the passer-by\nthere was little to draw attention. By day it lighted the fractional\nfloor space of a little stationer, who supplemented a slim business by\na sub-agency for railroad and steamship lines; but to-night this\nwindow seemed the framework of a marvel of coincidence. On the broad,\ndusty sill inside were propped two cards: the one on the left was his\nown red-lettered announcement for the week; the one at the right--oh,\nworld of wonders!--was a photogravure of that exact stretch of the\ninner coast of Florida which Gideon knew best, which was home.\n\nThere it was, the Indian River, rippling idly in full sunlight,\npalmettos leaning over the water, palmettos standing as irregular\nsentries along the low, reeflike island which stretched away out of\nthe picture. There was the gigantic, lonely pine he knew well, and,\nyes--he could just make it out--there was his own ramshackle little\npier, which stretched in undulating fashion, like a long-legged,\nwading caterpillar, from the abrupt shore-line of eroded coquina into\ndeep water.\n\nHe thought at first that this picture of his home was some new and\ndelicate device put forth by his press-agent. His name on one side of\na window, his birthplace upon the other--what could be more tastefully\nappropriate? Therefore, as he spelled out the reading-matter beneath\nthe photogravure, he was sharply disappointed. It read:\n\n      Spend this winter in balmy Florida.\n    Come to the Land of Perpetual Sunshine.\nGolf, tennis, driving, shooting, boating, fishing, all of the best.\n\nThere was more, but he had no heart for it; he was disappointed and\npuzzled. This picture had, after all, nothing to do with him. It was a\nchance, and yet, what a strange chance! It troubled and upset him. His\nblack, round-featured face took on deep wrinkles of perplexity. The\n\"misery\" which had hung darkly on his horizon for weeks engulfed him\nwithout warning. But in the very bitterness of his melancholy he knew\nat last his disease. It was not champagne or recreation that he\nneeded, not even a \"po'k-chop,\" although his desire for it had been a\nsymptom, a groping for a too homeopathic remedy: he was homesick.\n\nEasy, childish tears came into his eyes, and ran over his shining\ncheeks. He shivered forlornly with a sudden sense of cold, and\nabsently clutched at the lapels of his gorgeous, fur-lined ulster.\n\nThen in abrupt reaction he laughed aloud, so that the shrill, musical\nfalsetto startled the passers-by, and in another moment a little\nsemicircle of the curious watched spellbound as a black man,\nexquisitely appareled, danced in wild, loose grace before the dull\nbackground of a somewhat grimy and apparently vacant window. A newsboy\nrecognized him.\n\nHe heard his name being passed from mouth to mouth, and came partly to\nhis senses. He stopped dancing, and grinned at them.\n\n\"Say, you are Gideon, ain't you?\" his discoverer demanded, with a sort\nof reverent audacity.\n\n\"Yaas, _seh_,\" said Gideon; \"that's me. Yo' shu got it right.\" He\nbroke into a joyous peal of laughter--the laughter that had made him\nfamous, and bowed deeply before him. \"Gideon--posi-_tive_-ly his las'\npuffawmunce.\" Turning, he dashed for a passing trolley, and, still\nlaughing, swung aboard.\n\nHe was naturally honest. In a land of easy morality his friends had\naccounted him something of a paragon; nor had Stuhk ever had anything\nbut praise for him. But now he crushed aside the ethics of his intent\nwithout a single troubled thought. Running away has always been\ninherent in the negro. He gave one regretful thought to the gorgeous\nwardrobe he was leaving behind him; but he dared not return for it.\nStuhk might have taken it into his head to go back to their rooms. He\nmust content himself with the reflection that he was at that moment\nwearing his best.\n\nThe trolley seemed too slow for him, and, as always happened nowadays,\nhe was recognized; he heard his name whispered, and was aware of the\nadmiring glances of the curious. Even popularity had its drawbacks. He\ngot down in front of a big hotel and chose a taxicab from the waiting\nrank, exhorting the driver to make his best speed to the station.\nLeaning back in the soft depths of the cab, he savored his\nindependence, cheered already by the swaying, lurching speed. At the\nstation he tipped the driver in lordly fashion, very much pleased with\nhimself and anxious to give pleasure. Only the sternest prudence and\nan unconquerable awe of uniform had kept him from tossing bills to the\nvarious traffic policemen who had seemed to smile upon his hurry.\n\nNo through train left for hours; but after the first disappointment of\nmomentary check, he decided that he was more pleased than otherwise.\nIt would save embarrassment. He was going South, where his color would\nbe more considered than his reputation, and on the little local he\nchose there was a \"Jim Crow\" car--one, that is, specially set aside\nfor those of his race. That it proved crowded and full of smoke did\nnot trouble him at all, nor did the admiring pleasantries which the\nsplendor of his apparel immediately called forth. No one knew him;\nindeed, he was naturally enough mistaken for a prosperous gambler, a\nnot unflattering supposition. In the yard, after the train pulled out,\nhe saw his private car under a glaring arc light, and grinned to see\nit left behind.\n\nHe spent the night pleasantly in a noisy game of high-low-jack, and\nthe next morning slept more soundly than he had slept for weeks,\nhunched upon a wooden bench in the boxlike station of a North Carolina\njunction. The express would have brought him to Jacksonville in\ntwenty-four hours; the journey, as he took it, boarding any local that\nhappened to be going south, and leaving it for meals or sometimes for\nsleep or often as the whim possessed him, filled five happy days.\nThere he took a night train, and dozed from Jacksonville until a\nlittle north of New Smyrna.\n\nHe awoke to find it broad daylight, and the car half empty. The train\nwas on a siding, with news of a freight wreck ahead. Gideon stretched\nhimself, and looked out of the window, and emotion seized him. For all\nhis journey the South had seemed to welcome him, but here at last was\nthe country he knew. He went out upon the platform and threw back his\nhead, sniffing the soft breeze, heavy with the mysterious thrill of\nunplowed acres, the wondrous existence of primordial jungle, where\nlife has rioted unceasingly above unceasing decay. It was dry with the\nfine dust of waste places, and wet with the warm mists of slumbering\nswamps; it seemed to Gideon to tremble with the songs of birds, the\ndry murmur of palm leaves, and the almost inaudible whisper of the\ngray moss that festooned the live-oaks.\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" he murmured, apostrophizing it, \"yo' 's the right kind o'\nbreeze, yo' is. Yo'-all's healthy.\" Still sniffing, he climbed down to\nthe dusty road-bed.\n\nThe negroes who had ridden with him were sprawled about him on the\nground; one of them lay sleeping, face up, in the sunlight. The train\nhad evidently been there for some time, and there were no signs of an\nimmediate departure. He bought some oranges of a little, bowlegged\nblack boy, and sat down on a log to eat them and to give up his mind\nto enjoyment. The sun was hot upon him, and his thoughts were vague\nand drowsy. He was glad that he was alive, glad to be back once more\namong familiar scenes. Down the length of the train he saw white\npassengers from the Pullmans restlessly pacing up and down, getting\ninto their cars and out of them, consulting watches, attaching\nthemselves with gesticulatory expostulation to various officials; but\ntheir impatience found no echo in his thought. What was the hurry?\nThere was plenty of time. It was sufficient to have come to his own\nland; the actual walls of home could wait. The delay was pleasant,\nwith its opportunity for drowsy sunning, its relief from the grimy\nmonotony of travel. He glanced at the orange-colored \"Jim Crow\" with\ndistaste, and inspiration, dawning slowly upon him, swept all other\nthought before it in its great and growing glory.\n\nA brakeman passed, and Gideon leaped to his feet and pursued him.\n\n\"Misteh, how long yo'-all reckon this train goin' to be?\"\n\n\"About an hour.\"\n\nThe question had been a mere matter of form. Gideon had made up his\nmind, and if he had been told that they started in five minutes he\nwould not have changed it. He climbed back into the car for his coat\nand his hat, and then almost furtively stole down the steps again and\nslipped quietly into the palmetto scrub.\n\n\"'Most made the mistake of ma life,\" he chuckled, \"stickin' to that\nol' train foheveh. 'T isn't the right way at, all foh Gideon to come\nhome.\"\n\nThe river was not far away. He could catch the dancing blue of it from\ntime to time in ragged vista, and for this beacon he steered directly.\nHis coat was heavy on his arm, his thin patent-leather ties pinched\nand burned and demanded detours around swampy places, but he was\nhappy.\n\nAs he went along, his plan perfected itself. He would get into loose\nshoes again, old ones, if money could buy them, and old clothes, too.\nThe bull-briers snatching at his tailored splendor suggested that.\n\nHe laughed when the Florida partridge, a small quail, whirred up from\nunder his feet; he paused to exchange affectionate mockery with red\nsquirrels; and once, even when he was brought up suddenly to a\nfamiliar and ominous, dry reverberation, the small, crisp sound of the\nrolling drums of death, he did not look about him for some instrument\nof destruction, as at any other time he would have done, but instead\npeered cautiously over the log before him, and spoke in tolerant\nadmonition:\n\n\"Now, Misteh Rattlesnake, yo' jes min' yo' own business. Nobody's\ngoin' step on yo', ner go triflin' roun' yo' in no way whatsomeveh.\nYo' jes lay there in the sun an' git 's fat 's yo' please. Don' yo'\ntu'n yo' weeked li'l' eyes on Gideon. He's jes goin' 'long home, an'\nain' lookin' foh no muss.\"\n\nHe came presently to the water, and, as luck would have it, to a\nlittle group of negro cabins, where he was able to buy old clothes\nand, after much dickering, a long and somewhat leaky rowboat rigged\nout with a tattered leg-of-mutton sail. This he provisioned with a jug\nof water, a starch box full of white corn-meal, and a wide strip of\nlean razorback bacon.\n\nAs he pushed out from shore and set his sail to the small breeze that\nblew down from the north, an absolute contentment possessed him. The\nidle waters of the lagoon, lying without tide or current in eternal\nindolence, rippled and sparkled in breeze and sunlight with a merry\nsurface activity, and seemed to lap the leaky little boat more swiftly\non its way. Mosquito Inlet opened broadly before him, and skirting the\nend of Merritt's Island he came at last into that longest lagoon, with\nwhich he was most familiar, the Indian River. Here the wind died down\nto a mere breath, which barely kept his boat in motion; but he made no\nattempt to row. As long as he moved at all, he was satisfied. He was\nliving the fulfilment of his dreams in exile, lounging in the stern in\nthe ancient clothes he had purchased, his feet stretched comfortably\nbefore him in their broken shoes, one foot upon a thwart, the other\nhanging overside so laxly that occasional ripples lapped the run-over\nheel. From time to time he scanned shore and river for familiar points\nof interest--some remembered snag that showed the tip of one gnarled\nbranch. Or he marked a newly fallen palmetto, already rotting in the\nwater, which must be added to that map of vast detail that he carried\nin his head. But for the most part his broad black face was turned up\nto the blue brilliance above him in unblinking contemplation; his keen\neyes, brilliant despite their sun-muddied whites, reveled in the\nheights above him, swinging from horizon to horizon in the wake of an\norderly file of little bluebill ducks, winging their way across the\nriver, or brightening with interest at the rarer sight of a pair of\nmallards or redheads, lifting with the soaring circles of the great\nbald-headed eagle, or following the scattered squadron of heron--white\nheron, blue heron, young and old, trailing, sunlit, brilliant patches,\nclear even against the bright white and blue of the sky above them.\n\nOften he laughed aloud, sending a great shout of mirth across the\nwater in fresh relish of those comedies best known and best enjoyed.\nIt was as excruciatingly funny as it had ever been, when his boat\nnosed its way into a great flock of ducks idling upon the water, to\nsee the mad paddling haste of those nearest him, the reproachful turn\nof their heads, or, if he came too near, their spattering run out of\nwater, feet and wings pumping together as they rose from the surface,\nlooking for all the world like fat little women, scurrying with\nclutched skirts across city streets. The pelicans, too, delighted him\nas they perched with pedantic solemnity upon wharf-piles, or sailed in\nhunched and huddled gravity twenty feet above the river's surface in\nswift, dignified flight, which always ended suddenly in an abrupt,\nup-ended plunge that threw dignity to the winds in its greedy haste,\nand dropped them crashing into the water.\n\nWhen darkness came suddenly at last, he made in toward shore, mooring\nto the warm-fretted end of a fallen and forgotten landing. A\nstraggling orange-grove was here, broken lines of vanquished\ncultivation, struggling little trees swathed and choked in the\nfestooning gray moss, still showing here and there the valiant golden\ngleam of fruit. Gideon had seen many such places, had seen settlers\ncome and clear themselves a space in the jungle, plant their groves,\nand live for a while in lazy independence; and then for some reason or\nother they would go, and before they had scarcely turned their backs,\nthe jungle had crept in again, patiently restoring its ancient\nsovereignty. The place was eery with the ghost of dead effort; but it\npleased him.\n\nHe made a fire and cooked supper, eating enormously and with relish.\nHis conscience did not trouble him at all. Stuhk and his own career\nseemed already distant; they took small place in his thoughts, and\nserved merely as a background for his present absolute content. He\npicked some oranges, and ate them in meditative enjoyment. For a while\nhe nodded, half asleep, beside his fire, watching the darkened river,\nwhere the mullet, shimmering with phosphorescence, still leaped\nstarkly above the surface, and fell in spattering brilliance. Midnight\nfound him sprawled asleep beside his fire.\n\nOnce he awoke. The moon had risen, and a little breeze waved the\nhanging moss, and whispered in the glossy foliage of orange and\npalmetto with a sound like falling rain. Gideon sat up and peered\nabout him, rolling his eyes hither and thither at the menacing leap\nand dance of the jet shadows. His heart was beating thickly, his\nmuscles twitched, and the awful terrors of night pulsed and shuddered\nover him. Nameless specters peered at him from every shadow,\ningenerate familiars of his wild, forgotten blood. He groaned aloud in\na delicious terror; and presently, still twitching and shivering, fell\nasleep again. It was as if something magical had happened; his fear\nremembered the fear of centuries, and yet with the warm daylight was\nabsolutely forgotten.\n\nHe got up a little after sunrise, and went down to the river to bathe,\ndiving deep with a joyful sense of freeing himself from the last alien\ndust of travel. Once ashore again, however, he began to prepare his\nbreakfast with some haste. For the first time in his journey he was\nfeeling a sense of loneliness and a longing for his kind. He was still\nhappy, but his laughter began to seem strange to him in the solitude.\nHe tried the defiant experiment of laughing for the effect of it, an\nexperiment which brought him to his feet in startled terror; for his\nlaughter was echoed. As he stood peering about him, the sound came\nagain, not laughter this time, but a suppressed giggle. It was human\nbeyond a doubt. Gideon's face shone with relief and sympathetic\namusement; he listened for a moment, and then strode surely forward\ntoward a clump of low palms. There he paused, every sense alert. His\near caught a soft rustle, a little gasp of fear; the sound of a foot\nmoved cautiously.\n\n\"Missy,\" he said tentatively, \"I reckon yo'-all's come jes 'bout 'n\ntime foh breakfus. Yo' betteh have some. Ef yo' ain' too white to sit\ndown with a black man.\"\n\nThe leaves parted, and a smiling face as black as Gideon's own\nregarded him in shy amusement.\n\n\"Who is yo', man?\"\n\n\"I mought be king of Kongo,\" he laughed, \"but I ain't. Yo' see befo'\nyo' jes Gideon--at yo'r 'steemed sehvice.\" He bowed elaborately in the\nmock humility of assured importance, watching her face in pleasant\nanticipation.\n\nBut neither awe nor rapture dawned there. She repeated the name,\ninclining her head coquettishly; but it evidently meant nothing to\nher. She was merely trying its sound. \"Gideon, Gideon. I don' call to\nmin' any sech name ez that. Yo'-all's f'om up No'th likely.\" He was\nbeyond the reaches of fame.\n\n\"No,\" said Gideon, hardly knowing whether he was glad or sorry--\"no, I\nlive south of heah. What-all's yo' name?\"\n\nThe girl giggled deliciously.\n\n\"Man,\" she said, \"I shu got the mos' reediculoustest name you eveh did\nheah. They call me Vashti--yo' bacon's bu'nin'.\" She stepped out, and\nran past him to snatch his skillet deftly from the fire.\n\n\"Vashti\"--a strange and delightful name. Gideon followed her slowly.\nHer romantic coming and her romantic name pleased him; and, too, he\nthought her beautiful. She was scarcely more than a girl, slim and\nstrong and almost of his own height. She was barefooted, but her\nblue-checked gingham was clean and belted smartly about a small waist.\nHe remembered only one woman who ran as lithely as she did, one of the\nnumerous \"diving beauties\" of the vaudeville stage.\n\nShe cooked their breakfast, but he served her with an elaborate\ngallantry, putting forward all his new and foreign graces, garnishing\nhis speech with imposing polysyllables, casting about their picnic\nbreakfast a radiant aura of grandeur borrowed from the recent days of\nhis fame. And he saw that he pleased her, and with her open admiration\nessayed still greater flights of polished manner.\n\nHe made vague plans for delaying his journey as they sat smoking in\npleasant conversational ease; and when an interruption came it vexed\nhim.\n\n\"Vashty! Vashty!\" a woman's voice sounded thin and far away.\n\"Vashty-y! Yo' heah me, chile?\"\n\nVashti rose to her feet with a sigh.\n\n\"That's my ma,\" she said regretfully.\n\n\"What do yo' care?\" asked Gideon. \"Let her yell awhile.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"Ma's a moughty pow'ful 'oman, and she done got a club 'bout the size\no' my wrist.\" She moved off a step or so, and glanced back at him.\n\nGideon leaped to his feet.\n\n\"When yo' comin' back? Yo'--yo' ain' goin' without----\" He held out\nhis arms to her, but she only giggled and began to walk slowly away.\nWith a bound he was after her, one hand catching her lightly by the\nshoulder. He felt suddenly that he must not lose sight of her.\n\n\"Let me go! Tu'n me loose, yo'!\" The girl was still laughing, but\nevidently troubled. She wrenched herself away with an effort, only to\nbe caught again a moment later. She screamed and struck at him as he\nkissed her; for now she was really in terror.\n\nThe blow caught Gideon squarely in the mouth, and with such force that\nhe staggered back, astonished, while the girl took wildly to her\nheels. He stood for a moment irresolute, for something was happening\nto him. For months he had evaded love with a gentle embarrassment;\nnow, with the savage crash of that blow, he knew unreasoningly that he\nhad found his woman.\n\nHe leaped after her again, running as he had not run in years, in\nsavage, determined pursuit, tearing through brier and scrub, tripping,\nfalling, rising, never losing sight of the blue-clad figure before him\nuntil at last she tripped and fell, and he stood panting above her.\n\nHe took a great breath or so, and leaned over and picked her up in his\narms, where she screamed and struck and scratched at him. He laughed,\nfor he felt no longer sensible to pain, and, still chuckling, picked\nhis way carefully back to the shore, wading deep into the water to\nunmoor his boat. Then with a swift movement he dropped the girl into\nthe bow, pushed free, and clambered actively aboard.\n\nThe light, early morning breeze had freshened, and he made out well\ntoward the middle of the river, never even glancing around at the\nsound of the hallooing he now heard from shore. His exertions had\nquickened his breathing, but he felt strong and joyful. Vashti lay a\nhuddle of blue in the bow, crouched in fear and desolation, shaken and\ntorn with sobbing; but he made no effort to comfort her. He was\nuntroubled by any sense of wrong; he was simply and unreasoningly\nsatisfied with what he had done. Despite all his gentle, easygoing,\nlaughter-loving existence, he found nothing incongruous or unnatural\nin this sudden act of violence. He was aglow with happiness; he was\ntaking home a wife. The blind tumult of capture had passed; a great\ntenderness possessed him.\n\nThe leaky little boat was plunging and dancing in swift ecstasy of\nmovement; all about them the little waves ran glittering in the\nsunlight, plashing and slapping against the boat's low side, tossing\ntiny crests to the following wind, showing rifts of white here and\nthere, blowing handfuls of foam and spray. Gideon went softly about\nthe business of shortening his small sail, and came quietly back to\nhis steering-seat again. Soon he would have to be making for what lea\nthe western shore offered; but he was holding to the middle of the\nriver as long as he could, because with every mile the shores were\ngrowing more familiar, calling to him to make what speed he could.\nVashti's sobbing had grown small and ceased; he wondered if she had\nfallen asleep.\n\nPresently, however, he saw her face raised--a face still shining with\ntears. She saw that he was watching her, and crouched low again. A\ndash of spray spattered over her, and she looked up frightened,\nglancing fearfully overside; then once more her eyes came back to him,\nand this time she got up, still small and crouching, and made her way\nslowly and painfully down the length of the boat, until at last Gideon\nmoved aside for her, and she sank in the bottom beside him, hiding her\neyes in her gingham sleeve.\n\nGideon stretched out a broad hand and touched her head lightly; and\nwith a tiny gasp her fingers stole up to his.\n\n\"Honey,\" said Gideon--\"Honey, yo' ain' mad, is yo'?\"\n\nShe shook her head, not looking at him.\n\n\"Yo' ain' grievin' foh yo' ma?\"\n\nAgain she shook her head.\n\n\"Because,\" said Gideon, smiling down at her, \"I ain' got no beeg club\nlike she has.\"\n\nA soft and smothered giggle answered him, and this time Vashti looked\nup and laid her head against him with a small sigh of contentment.\n\nGideon felt very tender, very important, at peace with himself and all\nthe world. He rounded a jutting point, and stretched out a black hand,\npointing.", "title": "The Best American Humorous Short Stories"}
