{"summary": "The town of Rimrock, Arizona is run by political boss Luke Starr. When one of Starr’s henchmen wishes to escape from Starr he meets with the editor of the town newspaper, Roy Carlin to ask his help. Starr discovers the meeting and he and his loyal henchmen shoot the both of them; spreading the story that the two killed each other in a gunfight.\nRoy Carlin’s brother Jess is a former Texas sheriff now living in semi-retirement with his girlfriend in Mexico. He has a price on his head for unstated crimes done in the United States but earns income and beats the boredom of his quiet life by capturing fugitive American criminals and turning them over to American lawmen who return them across the border.\nWhen Jess finds out the story of his brother he throws the quiet life away to bring his brother’s killer to justice as he knows Roy never carried a firearm. On the way he is unsuccessfully ambushed by bounty hunters and has to escape without his saddle.\nStopping off at a ranch he thinks is vacant, he leaves money for a saddle but is held at gunpoint by the ranch owner Sandy. Sandy changes her opinion on Jess when she discovers he has left money that is four times the value of the saddle.\nRiding into Rimrock, Jess unsuccessfully tries to find out information on his brother’s death. The new editor of the paper asks Jess to stay to eliminate Luke Starr and his band. Jess explains that in the past when he was a sheriff in the same town where his brother was a newspaper editor they cleaned up the town but found out the hard way that the men who replaced those they got rid of were much worse.\nAfter fist and gun fights, Jess is finally able to establish proof of Luke’s involvement when he finds a decorative concho that leather worker Sandy is able to identify as one that came off Luke’s gunbelt.\n\n", "full_text": "generously made available by Internet Archive (https://archive.org)\n\n\n\nNote: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this\n      file which includes the original illustrations in color.\n      See 50387-h.htm or 50387-h.zip:\n      (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50387/50387-h/50387-h.htm)\n      or\n      (http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50387/50387-h.zip)\n\n\n      Images of the original pages are available through\n      Internet Archive.

Old Crit and his wild Texas cowboys had left\nthe corral at dawn, riding out mysteriously with their running irons in\ntheir chaps; the dogs had crawled under José Garcia's house and gone\nto sleep; to the north the Tonto trail stretched away vacant and only\nthe brawling of the Verde as it rushed over the rocky ford suggested\nthe savage struggle that was going on in the land. Within the adobe\nfort that served for both store and saloon Angevine Thorne, Old Crit's\nroustabout, sat tipped back in his chair breathing thoughtfully through\na mouth-organ while a slender Mexican girl, lingering by the doorway,\nlistened in childish adoration.\n\n\"_Oyez_, Babe,\" she pleaded, lisping in broken English, \"sing 'Work iss\nDone' for me, _otra vez_, once more.\"\n\n\"Yore maw will be singin' a different tune if you don't hurry home\nwith that lard,\" counselled Babe, but seeing that she was in no mood\nto depart he cleared his throat to sing. \"You don't know how bad this\nmakes me feel, Marcelina,\" he said, rubbing his hand over his bald spot\nand smoothing down his lank hair, \"but I'll sing you the first verse—it\nain't so bad.\" He stood up and turned his eyes to heaven; a seraphic\nsmile came into his face, as if he saw the angels, and in a caressing\ntenor voice he began:--\n\n    \"A jolly group of cowboys, discussing their plans one day\n    When one says, 'I will tell you something, boys, before\n        I'm gone away.\n    I am a cowboy as you see, although I'm dressed in rags.\n    I used to be a wild one, a-taking on big jags.\n    I have a home, boys, a good one, you all know,\n    Although I have not seen it since long ago.\n    I am going back to Dixie, once for to see them all;\n    I am going back to Dixie to see my mother when work is done\n        this Fall.\n\n    \"'After the round-ups are over, after the shipping is all done,\n    I am going to see my mother before my money is all gone.\n    My mother's heart is breaking, breaking for me, and that's all.\n    And with God's help I will see her when work is done this Fall.'\"\n\nA pause followed his last words and the singer limped in behind the\ncounter. \"Well, that's all, now,\" he said, waving her away, \"go on\nhome, child—can't you see it makes me feel powerful bad?\"\n\nThe girl smiled with the sweet melancholy of her race. \"I like to feel\nbad,\" she said. \"Sing about the wind.\"\n\nAngevine Thorne looked down upon her and shook his head sadly. \"Ah,\nMarcelina,\" he said, \"you are growing up to be a woman.\" Then he sighed\nand began again:—\n\n    \"That very same night this poor cowboy went out to stand his guard.\n    The wind was blowing fiercely and the rain was falling hard.\n    The cattle they got frightened and ran in a mad stampede.\n    Poor boy, he tried to head them while riding at full speed.\n    Riding in the darkness so loudly he did shout,\n    A-trying to head the cattle, a-trying to turn them about,\n    When his saddled night-horse stumbled and upon him did fall.\n    Now the poor boy will not see his mother when work is done\n        this Fall.\"\n\n\"And now the rest—how he died,\" breathed Marcelina, and once more the\ntroubadour smiled.\n\n    \"We picked him up so gently and laid him on his bed,\n    A-standing all around the poor cowboy, a-thinking he was dead,\n    When he opened wide his blue eyes, looked around and said:\n    'Boys, I think those are the last steers I shall ever head.\n    So Bill, you take my saddle, and Charley, you take my bed,\n    And George, you take my six-shooter and be sure that I am dead.\n    I am going to a new range, for I hear my Master's call,\n    And will not see my aged mother when work is done this Fall.\n\n    \"'After the round-ups were over, after the shipping was all done,\n    I was going to see my mother before my money was all gone.\n    My mother's heart is breaking, breaking for me and that's all,\n    And if God had spared my absence I would have seen her\n    When work was done this Fall.'\"\n\nA rapt silence, such as artists love, followed the last wailing cadence\nof the song; the stillness of the desert crept in upon them, broken\nonly by the murmur of the river and an almost subterranean thud of\nhoofs; then with a jingle of spurs and the creaking of wet leather a\nhorseman rode up and halted before the door. The water sloshed in his\nboots as he dismounted but he swung into the store with the grace of a\ncavalier—a young man, almost a boy, yet broad-shouldered and muscular,\nwith features moulded to an expression of singular resolution and\ncourage. A heavy pair of apron chaps—sure sign of Texas—cumbered his\nlimbs and the wooden handle of a Colts forty-five showed above its\nholster in the right leg; for the rest, he wore a new jumper over his\nblue shirt, and a broad, high-crowned hat, without frills. As the\nstranger headed for the bar with business-like directness Angevine\nThorne felt a sudden sense of awe, almost of fear, and he wondered for\nthe instant if it was a hold-up; but the Texan simply dropped a quarter\non the counter and motioned to a bottle.\n\n\"Two,\" he corrected, as Babe filled a single glass; and, shoving the\nsecond one towards his host, who eyed it with studied unconcern, the\ncowboy tossed off his own and looked around.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he inquired, as Babe moved thoughtfully away;\n\"swore off? All right, you drink the chaser, then,\" and leaving the\nsuperfluous glass of water on the bar he drank the whiskey himself.\n\n\"Ughr! That's the real old tarantula-juice,\" he observed, as the fiery\nliquor made him shudder. \"Since when did you swear off?\"\n\n\"Six weeks,\" responded Babe, shortly. \"How's Texas?\"\n\n\"All right,\" replied the cowboy. \"Did it git away with you?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" returned the bar-keeper. \"Don't like to talk about it—say, is\nthey anybody left in Texas?\"\n\nThe stranger gazed at him shrewdly for a moment, and a grim light came\ninto his eye.\n\n\"Don't like to talk about it,\" he said, \"but now you speak of it I know\nof one feller, for sure—and dam' badly left, too. May be around on\ncrutches by now.\" He glanced out at his horse, which had just shaken\nitself under the saddle, and let his gaze wander to Marcelina.\n\n\"Pretty girls you have in this country,\" he remarked, turning a little\nsidewise to Babe, but watching her from beneath his hat. \"Don't speak\nany English, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Babe, sullenly, \"her mother don't like cowboys. _Oyez,\nMarcelina, vaya se a su madre, chiquita!_\" But though her mother was\ncalling, the wilful Marcelina did not move. Like an Aztec princess she\nstood silent and impassive, gazing out from beneath her dark lashes\nand waiting to catch some further word of praise from this dashing\nstranger. Undoubtedly, Marcelina was growing to be a woman.\n\n\"Name's Marcelina, eh?\" soliloquized the cowboy, innocently. \"Pity she\ncan't savvy English—she's right pretty, for a Mex.\"\n\nAt that last unconscious word of derogation the regal beauty of\nMarcelina changed to a regal scorn and flashing her black eyes she\nstrode towards the door like a tragic queen.\n\n\"_Gr-ringo!_\" she hissed, turning upon him in the doorway, and seizing\nupon her pail of lard she scampered up the trail.\n\n\"Hell's fire!\" exclaimed the _Tehanno_. \"Did she understand what I\nsaid?\"\n\n\"That's what,\" replied Babe, ungraciously, \"you done queered yourself\nwith her for life. She won't stand for nothin' aginst her people.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" grumbled the newcomer, \"that's what comes from drinkin' yore\npisen whiskey. I begin to savvy now, Pardner, why you passed up that\nsheep-herder dope and took water.\"\n\nHe grinned sardonically, making a motion as of a pin-wheel twirling in\nhis head, but the bar-keeper did not fall in with his jest. \"Nothin'\nof the kind,\" he retorted. \"W'y, boy, I could drink that whole bottle\nand walk a tight rope. I guess you don't know me—I'm Angevine Thorne,\nsometimes known as 'Babe'!\" He threw out his chest, but the cowboy\nstill looked puzzled.\n\n\"Did you come through Geronimo,\" inquired Babe, returning to the\nattack, \"and never heard of me? Well then, Pardner, I'll have to put\nyou wise—I'm Angevine Thorne, the Champion Booze-fighter of Arizona!\"\nHe dropped back to his pose and the cowboy contemplated him with grave\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Mr. Thorne,\" he said, holding out his hand, \"my name is Dalhart—Pecos\nDalhart, from Texas—and I'm proud to make your acquaintance. Won't you\nhave a drink on the strength of it?\"\n\n\"Thank you just as much,\" replied Mr. Thorne, affably, \"but I've sworn\noff. I've been the greatest booze-fighter of Arizona for twenty years,\nbut I've sworn off. Never, never, will I let another drop of liquor\npass my lips! I have been sentenced to the Geronimo jail for life for\nconspicuous drunkenness; I have passed my days in riotous living and my\nnights in the county jail, but the love of a good mother has followed\nme through it all and now I am going to quit! I'm saving up money to go\nhome.\"\n\n\"Good for you,\" commented Pecos Dalhart, with the good-natured\ncredulity which men confer upon drunkards, \"stay with it! But say, not\nto change the subject at all, where can I git something to eat around\nhere? I'm ganted down to a shadder.\"\n\n\"You're talkin' to the right man, son,\" returned Babe, hustling out\nfrom behind the bar. \"I'm one of the best round-up cooks that ever\nmixed the sour-dough—in fact, I'm supposed to be cookin' for Crit's\noutfit right now and he just saws this bar-keep job off on me between\ntimes, so's to tempt me and git my money—when I git drunk, you savvy.\nHe's a great feller, Old Crit—one of the boys up the river has got a\npenny Crit passed off on him in the dark for a dime and he swears to\nGod that pore Injun's head is mashed flat, jest from bein' pinched so\nhard. Pinch? W'y, he's like a pet eagle I had one time—every time he\nlit on my arm he'd throw the hooks into me—couldn't help it—feet built\nthat way. An' holler! He'd yell _Cree_ so you c'd hear him a mile if\nanybody tried to steal his meat. Same way with Crit. Old Man Upton over\nhere on the Tonto happened to brand one of his calves once and he's\nbeen hollerin' about that maverick ever since. You've heard of this war\ngoin' on up here, hain't you? Well that's just Old Crit tryin' to git\nhis revenge. If he's burnt one U calf he's burnt a thousand and they\nain't cowboys enough in Texas to hold up his end, if it ever comes to\nfightin'. This here is the cow-camp—throw yore horse in the corral over\nthere and I'll cook up a little chuck—jest about to eat, myse'f.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGOOD EYE, THE MAVERICK KING\n\n\nAngevine Thorne was still talking mean about his boss when the cowboys\ncame stringing back from their day's riding, hungry as wolves. At the\nfirst dust sign in the northern pass the round-up cook had piled wood\non the fire to make coals and as the iron-faced punchers rode up he\nhammered on a tin plate and yelled:—\n\n\"Grub pile! Come a-runnin'!\"\n\nThey came, with the dirt of the branding still on their faces and\nbeards and their hands smeared with blood. Each in turn glanced\nfurtively at Pecos Dalhart, who sat off at one side contemplating the\nlandscape, grabbed a plate and coffee cup and fell to without a word.\nLast of all came Isaac Crittenden, the Boss, tall, gaunt, and stooping,\nhis head canted back to make up for the crook in his back and his one\ngood eye roving about restlessly. As he rode in, Pecos glanced up and\nnodded and then continued his industry of drawing brands in the dust.\nThe Boss, on his part, was no more cordial; but after the meal was\nfinished he took another look at the newcomer, spoke a few words with\nthe cook, and strolled over for a talk.\n\n\"Howdy, stranger,\" he began, with a quick glance at the brands in the\nsand; \"travellin' far?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" responded Pecos, \"jest up the trail a piece.\"\n\nA shadow crossed the Boss's face—Upton's was \"up the trail a piece\"—but\nhe did not follow that lead.\n\n\"Know any of them irons?\" he inquired, pointing to the sand-drawings,\nwhich represented half the big brands between the Panhandle and the\nGila.\n\n\"Sure thing,\" replied the cowboy, \"I've run 'em.\"\n\n\"And burnt 'em, too, eh?\" put in Crittenden, shrewdly; but Pecos\nDalhart was not as young as he looked.\n\n\"Not on your life,\" he countered, warily, \"that don't go where I come\nfrom.\"\n\n\"Of course not, of course not,\" assented the cowman, instantly\naffecting a bluff honesty, \"and it don't go here, neither, if any one\nshould inquire. A man's brand is his property and he's got a right\nto it under the law. I've got a few cows here myself—brand IC on the\nribs—and I'd like to see the blankety-blank that would burn it. I'd\nthrow 'em in the pen, if it was the last act. Where you travellin'?\"\n\nHe jerked this out as a sort of challenge, and the cowboy rose to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Upton's,\" he said briefly.\n\n\"Upton's!\" repeated Crittenden, \"and what do you figure on doin' up\nthere?\"\n\n\"Well, I heard he was a good feller to work for—thought I'd take on for\na cow hand.\"\n\nPecos stated the proposition judicially, but as he spoke he met the\nglowering glance of Crittenden with a cold and calculating eye.\nThe cattle-stealing war between John Upton of Tonto Basin and Old\nCrit of Verde Crossing was no secret in Arizona, though the bloody\nTewkesbury-Graham feud to the north took away from its spectacular\ninterest and reduced it to the sordid level of commercialism. It\nwas, in fact, a contest as to which could hire the nerviest cowboys\nand run off the most cattle, and Pecos Dalhart knew this as well as\nIsaac Crittenden. They stood and glared at each other for a minute,\ntherefore, and then Old Crit broke loose.\n\n\"Whoever told you that John Upton is a good feller is a liar!\" he\nstormed, bringing his fist down into his hand. \"He's jest a common,\nlow-down cow-thief, as I've told him to his face; and a man that will\nsteal from his friends will do anything. Now, young man, before we go\nany farther I want to tell you what kind of a reptile John Upton is.\nHim and me run our cattle over in Tonto Basin for years, and if we'd\never have any question about a calf or a _orehanna_ I'd always say,\n'Well, take 'im, John,' jest like that, because I didn't want to have\nno racket with a friend. But they's some people, the more you give in\nto 'em the more they run it over you, and they come a day when I had to\nput my foot down and say, 'No, that calf is mine,' and I put my iron on\n'im right there. Now that calf was mine, you understand, and I branded\nhim IC on the ribs, in the corral and before witnesses, accordin' to\nlaw, but about a week afterward when I come across that critter, John\nUpton had run a big U after my brand, makin' it ICU. Well, you may\nlaugh, but that's no kind of a joke to play on a friend and I jest\nhopped down off'n my horse and run a figger 2 after it, making it ICU2;\nand about the time John Upton gits his funny ICU brand in the book I\ngoes down and registers ICU2, goin' him one better. Now that's carryin'\na joke pretty far, and I admit it, but Upton wasn't funnin'; that\ncrooked-nose dastard had set out to steal my cows from the start and,\nseein' I'd euchered him on the ICU racket he went ahead and slapped a\nbig J in front of my IC iron, and began branding my cows into what he\ncalled his Jay-Eye-See brand. Well, that settled it. I'm an honest man,\nbut when a man steals cows from me I don't know any way to break even\nin this country but to steal back, and while he was putting his J's on\nmy IC critters I jumped in and put IC2's on his U's until he was ready\nto quit. He's _afraid_ to burn my brand now—he dassent do it—and so\nhe's beginnin' to squeal because I've got 'im in the door; but say—\" he\nbeckoned with his head—\"come over here by the corral, I want to talk to\nyou.\"\n\nThroughout this long tale of woe Pecos Dalhart had shown but scant\ninterest, having heard it already, with variations, from Babe.\nAccording to that faithless individual Old Crit would steal fleas\nfrom a pet monkey and skin them for the hide and tallow; his favorite\npastime, outside of cattle-rustling, being to take on cowboys and then\nhold out their pay, a rumor which caused Pecos Dalhart to regard him\nwarily.\n\n\"Now say,\" began the Boss of Verde Crossing, as soon as they were out\nof hearing, \"you don't need to go to that hoss-thief Upton in order\nto git a job. I'm always lookin' for the right kind of man, myself.\nHave you had any experience at this kind of thing?\" He went through\nthe dexterous pantomime of burning a brand through a blanket, but the\ncowboy only turned away scornfully.\n\n\"If I had I'd never be dam' fool enough to talk about it,\" he said.\n\n\"Oho!\" observed Crit, rubbing the side of his nose slyly, \"you're\ntravelling for your health, are you?\"\n\n\"No!\" snarled the Texan. \"The only people that are lookin' for me are\ntryin' to keep away from me, so you don't need to work that auger any\ndeeper. Now, Mr. Crittenden, I'm a man of few words—what can I do for\nyou?\"\n\n\"We-ell,\" began the cowman, and once more he paused to meditate.\n\n\"Since you inquire,\" continued the cowboy, \"I don't mind tellin' you\nthat I'm travellin' for excitement—and to grab some money. If you've\ngot any proposition that might appeal to me, spit it out—if not, they's\nno harm done.\"\n\n\"Well, wait a minute!\" cried Old Crit, peevishly.\n\n\"My time's valuable,\" observed Pecos, sententiously. \"You can trust me\nas good as I can trust you—mebby better. I don't hear nobody accuse you\nof being sure pay, but if I take your job I want you to remember that I\ndraw my money at the end of every month or else I collect and quit. Now\nif you can jar that proposition out of your system, I'll listen to it.\"\n\n\"I guess you'll do,\" said the cowman, as if quieting his own\nmisgivings. \"I've got a little special work that I want done on the\nquiet, markin' over some cows and calves. The man that does it will\nhave to hide out up in that rough country and I'll pay him—forty\ndollars.\"\n\n\"Eighty,\" said the Texan.\n\n\"W'y, I'm only payin' my round-up hands thirty,\" protested Crittenden,\nweakly; \"I'll give you fifty, though.\"\n\n\"Eighty, cash,\" said the cowboy. \"You'll make that on the first ten\ncalves.\"\n\n\"Sixty!\" pleaded Crit.\n\n\"I want my money in my hand at the end of every month,\" added Pecos,\nand then there was a silence.\n\n\"All right,\" grumbled the cowman, at last, \"but you understand I expect\nsomething to show for all that money. Now I want you to go around the\ncorner thar like you was mad, 'n' saddle up and ride on, like you was\ngoin' to Upton's. Then when it comes night I want you to ride back\nand camp out there by that big ironwood over against the mesa. As\nsoon as me and the boys are out of sight in the mornin' my Mexican,\nJoe Garcia, will come out to you with some grub and take you over to\nCarrizo Springs, and I want you to _stay_ there as long as I keep\ndriftin' U cows in over the Peaks. Now look—here's your job—I want you\nto burn every one of them Upton cows over into a Wine-glass\"—he made\nthe figure [Illustration: Y [++] Brand in the shape of a wine-glass.]\nin the sand—\"and run it on the calves. Savvy? Well, git, then, and\nremember what I said about lookin' mad—I don't want my punchers to git\nonto this!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE DOUBLE CROSS\n\n\nA month passed, drearily; and while Ike Crittenden and his punchers\ngathered U cows on one side of the Four Peaks and shoved them over the\nsummit Pecos Dalhart roped them as they came in to Carrizo Springs for\nwater and doctored over their brands. The boys were following in the\nwake of Upton's round-up and the brands on the calves were freshly\nmade and therefore easy to change, but it called for all of Pecos's\nprofessional skill to alter the cow brands to match. In order not to\ncause adverse comment it is necessary that the cow and calf shall show\nthe same mark and since the mother's brand was always old and peeled\nPecos called into requisition a square of wet gunny-sack or blanket\nto help give the antique effect. Spreading this over the old U he\nretraced the letter through it with a red-hot iron and then extended\nthe brand downward until it formed a neat Wine-glass ([Illustration: Y\n[++] Brand in the shape of a wine-glass.]), scalded rather than seared\ninto the hair. Such a brand would never look fresh or peel, though it\nmight grow dim with years, and after working the ear-marks over on cow\nand calf the transformation was complete. But while the results of his\nlabor was a fine little bunch of Wine-glass cows hanging around Carrizo\nSprings, to Pecos himself, tying a knot in a buckskin string to count\noff each weary day, the month seemed interminable.\n\nThere was a sound of music in the store as he rode into Verde Crossing\nand he spurred forward, eager for the sight of a human face and a\nchance to sit down and talk. But at the thud of hoofs and the chink of\nspurs Angevine Thorne brought his song to an untimely close and, as\nPecos dismounted, Marcelina Garcia slipped out through the door and\nstarted towards home, favoring him in passing with a haughty stare.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mex!\" he exclaimed, bowing and touching his heart in an\nexcess of gallantry, \"fine large day, ain't it?\"\n\n\"_Gringo!_\" shrilled Marcelina, flaunting her dark hair, \"_Pendejo\nTexano!_ Ahhr!\" She shuddered and thrust out her tongue defiantly,\nbut as the \"fool Texan\" only laughed and clattered into the store she\npaused and edged back towards the door for further observations.\n\n\"W'y, hello, Angy!\" cried Pecos, racking jovially up to the bar, \"how's\nthe champeen? Sober as a judge, hey? Well, gimme another shot of that\nsnake-pisen and if it don't kill me I may swear off too, jest to be\nsociable! Say, what does 'pen_day_ho' mean?\" He glanced roguishly back\ntowards the door, where he knew Marcelina was listening, and laughed\nwhen he got the translation.\n\n\"Dam' fool, hey? Well, I thought it was something like that—kinder\np'lite and lady-like, you know. Marcelina hung that on me as I come in,\nbut I called her a Mex and I'll stand by it. Where's Old Crit?\"\n\nAngevine Thorne drew himself up and regarded the cowboy with grave\ndispleasure.\n\n\"Mr. Crittenden is out riding,\" he said, \"and I'll thank you not to\nrefer to the nativity of my friend, Miss Garcia.\"\n\n\"Certainly not—to be sure!\" protested Pecos Dalhart. \"If you will jest\nkindly give me an introduction to the young lady I'll—\"\n\n\"See you in hell first,\" broke in Angy, with asperity. \"Where you been\nall the time?\"\n\n\"Ramblin' around, ramblin' around,\" answered Pecos, waving his hand\nvaguely. \"What's the chances for a little music and song to while the\ntime away? I'm lonely as a dog.\"\n\n\"Joe Garcia tells me he's been packin' grub out to you at Carrizo—what\nyou been doin' in that God-forsaken hole?\"\n\n\"Yore friend Joe talks too much,\" observed Pecos, briefly, \"and I\nreckon _you_ tell everything you know, don't you? Well and good, then,\nI'll keep you out of trouble with the Boss by listenin' to what you\nknow already. Can you sing the 'Ranger,' or 'California Joe'? No?\nCan't even sing 'Kansas,' can you? Well, it's too bad about you, but\nI'm going to show you that they's another canary bird on the Verde,\nand he can sure sing.\" With this declaration Pecos leaned back against\nthe bar, squared his shoulders, and in a voice which had many a time\ncarolled to a thousand head of cattle burst into a boastful song.\n\n    \"Ooh, I can take the wildest bronco\n          Of the wild and woolly West;\n          I can back him, I can ride him,\n          Let him do his level best.\n          I can handle any creature\n          Ever wore a coat of hair,\n          And I had a lively tussle\n          With a tarnal grizzly bear.\"\n\nHe glanced slyly towards the door, threw out his chest, and essayed\nonce more to attract the attention of his girl, if she was anywhere\nwithin a mile.\n\n    \"Ooh, I can rope and tie a long-horn,\n          Of the wildest Texas brand,\n          And in any disagreement,\n          I can play a leading hand.\n          I—\"\n\nA dark mass of hair shading a pair of eyes as black and inquisitive as\na chipmunk's appeared suddenly in the vacant square of the doorway and\ninstantly the bold cowboy stopped his song.\n\n\"Good-morning, Miss Garcia,\" he said, bowing low, \"won't you come\nin—now, Angy, do your duty or I'll beat you to death!\" At this hasty\naside Angevine Thorne did the honors, though with a bad grace.\n\n\"Marcelina, this is Mr. Dalhart—you better go home now, your mother's\ncallin' you.\"\n\n\"I will not shake hands with a _Texano_!\" pronounced Marcelina,\nstepping into the open and folding her arms disdainfully.\n\n\"Come on in then and hear the music,\" suggested Pecos, peaceably.\n\n\"Pah! The _Tehannos_ sing like coyotes!\" cried Marcelina, twisting\nup her lips in derision. \"They are bad, bad men—_mi madre_ say so.\nNo, I go home—and when you are gone Babe will sing _sweet_ moosic for\nme.\" She bowed, with a little smile for Babe, and glided through the\ndoorway; and though he lingered about until Old Crit came in, Pecos\nDalhart failed to catch another glimpse of this new queen of his heart.\n\nIt was dusk when Crittenden rode into camp, and at sight of Pecos\nDalhart sitting by the fire the cowman's drawn face, pinched by hunger\nand hard riding, puckered up into a knot.\n\n\"What you doin' down here?\" he demanded, when he had beckoned him to\none side.\n\n\"Come down for my pay,\" responded the cowboy, briefly.\n\n\"Your pay,\" fumed Crittenden, \"your pay! What do you need with money up\nat Carrizo? Say, have you been gittin' many?\" he whispered, eagerly.\n\"Have they been comin' in on you?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Branded forty-two cows, thirty calves, and sixteen twos.\nBut how about it—do I draw?\"\n\n\"Only thirty calves! W'y, what in the world have you been doin'? I\ncould pick up that many mavericks on the open range. You must've been\nlayin' down under a tree!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Pecos, \"and talkin' to myse'f, I was that\nlonely. But if you'll kindly fork over that eighty that's comin' to\nme we'll call it square, all the same—I only branded about a thousand\ndollars' worth of cows for you.\"\n\n\"Eighty dollars!\" cried Old Crit. \"W'y, I never agreed to nothin' like\nthat—I said I'd give you sixty. But I'll tell you what I'll do,\" he\nadded, quickly, \"I'll make it eighty if you'll go up there for another\nmonth.\"\n\n\"After I git my first month's pay they will be time to discuss that,\"\nreplied Pecos Dalhart, and after a thousand protestations the cowman\nfinally went down into his overalls and produced the money.\n\n\"Now what about next month?\" he demanded, sharply.\n\n\"Nope,\" said Pecos, pocketing his eighty dollars, \"too lonely—too much\ntrouble collectin' my pay—don't like the job.\"\n\n\"Give you eighty dollars,\" urged Crit, \"that's a heap o' money for one\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Nope, this'll last me a while—so long.\" He started toward the corral\nbut Crittenden caught him by the arm instantly.\n\n\"Here, wait a minute,\" he rasped, \"what's the matter with you anyhow?\nI'm ridin' early and late on my round-up and dependin' on you to finish\nthis job up! You ain't goin' to quit me right in the middle of it, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"That's what,\" returned Pecos. \"I ain't so particular about brandin'\na maverick once in a while—every cowman does that—but this idee of\nstealin' from a man you never saw goes agin' me. I git to thinkin'\nabout it, an' it ain't right!\"\n\n\"Aw, sho, sho, boy,\" protested Crittenden, \"you don't want to mind a\nlittle thing like that—I thought you was a man with nerve. Now here,\nI can't stop to go out there now and I want to git that work finished\nup—I'll give you _eight-y-five dol-lars_ to stay another month! This\nman Upton is the biggest cow-thief in the country,\" he went on, as\nPecos shook his head, \"it ain't stealin' to rob a thief, is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, ain't it?\" inquired the cow-puncher, gravely, and he smiled grimly\nto himself as Crittenden endeavored to set his mind at rest. \"All right\nthen,\" he said, cutting short the cowman's labored justification of\ncattle-rustling, \"I'll go you—for a hundred.\"\n\n\"A hundred!\" repeated Crittenden, aghast. \"Well, for—all right, all\nright,\" he cried, as Pecos moved impatiently away. \"Now you pull out of\nhere the way you did before and I'll have Joe pack you over some more\ngrub. A hundred dollars,\" he murmured, shaking his head at the thought,\n\"that boy will ruin me.\"\n\nEarly the next morning Pecos Dalhart rode slowly up the trail that led\nto Carrizo Springs and the deserted country beyond, a land where as\nyet the cowmen had not extended their sway. To his left rose the sharp\ngranite spires of the Four Peaks, to the right gleamed the silvery\nthread of the Salagua, that mighty river that flowed in from the east;\nand all the country between was a jumble of cliffs and buttes and\nridges and black cañons, leading from the mountains to the river.\n\n\"So it ain't no crime to rob a thief, hey?\" he muttered, when, topping\nthe last ridge, he gazed down at Carrizo Springs and across at the\nwhite-worn trail which led into the wilderness beyond. \"Well, if that's\nthe case I might as well search out that country over there and git\nbusy on Old Crit. A man's a dam' fool to steal a thousand dollars'\nworth of cattle and only git eighty dollars for it.\"\n\nThree days later, riding by a trail that led ever to the east, Pecos\ncame upon a narrow valley filled with cottonwoods and wild walnuts and\nechoing to the music of running water. A fine brook, flowing down from\nthe brushy heights of the Peaks, leaped and tumbled over the bowlders\nand disappeared through a narrow cleft below, where the two black walls\ndrew together until they seemed almost to block the cañon. As Pecos\nrode cautiously down the creek-bed he jumped a bunch of cattle from\nthe shade of the alders and, spurring after them as they shambled\noff, he saw that they bore the familiar U, even to the young calves.\nUndoubtedly they belonged to the same bunch that he had been working\non over at Carrizo Springs—the fresh-branded calves and U cows that\nCrittenden was shoving over the Peaks. Riding farther down the gulch\nPecos came upon a cave at the base of the overhanging cliff. In time\npast the Indians had camped there, but the ashes of their fires were\nbedded and only their crude pictures on the smoke-grimed rocks remained\nto tell the tale. It was the cave of Lost Dog Cañon.\n\nOn their trip over the simple-minded José had spoken of a lost cañon\nsomewhere over in the mountains but Pecos had never dreamed of finding\na paradise like this. According to José the Cañon of Perro Perdito was\nhaunted by a spirit which was _muy malo_, throwing down great rocks\nfrom the sides of the cañon and howling like a lost dog at night, but\nin the broad light of noonday Pecos was undaunted and he rode on into\nthe tunnel-like box cañon until it pinched down to a mere cleft. It was\nan eerie place, but there never was a ghost yet that threw a track like\na cow and, led on by their familiar foot-prints among the rocks, Pecos\nforged ahead until he stepped out suddenly into a new world. Behind\nhim the pent and overhanging walls shut out the light of day but here\nthe sun was shining into a deep valley where in exquisite miniature\nlay parks and grassy meadows, while cathedral spires of limestone,\nrising from the cañon floor, joined their mighty flanks to the\nrim-rock which shut the whole space in. The glittering waters of the\nSalagua, far below, marked a natural barrier to the south and as Pecos\nDalhart looked at the narrow trail which had brought him in he began\ninstinctively to figure on a drift fence, to close the entrance to the\npocket, and make the hidden valley a mile-wide pasture and corral. All\nnature seemed conspiring to make him a cattle-rustler and this hidden\npasture, with its grass and water and the gate opening at his very\ndoor, cast the die. Two days later he moved his camp to Lost Dog Cañon\nand flew at the fence with feverish energy. Within a week he had the\nbox cañon barricaded from wall to wall and then, as the U cows came\ndown to the creek to drink, he roped them, worked over their brands,\nand threw them into his new pasture. By this time, with his tongue in\nhis cheek, he attached a circle instead of a bar to the U and named his\nnew brand the Monkey-wrench ([Illustration: [++] Brand in the shape of\na monkey-wrench]). If he had any qualms as to the morality of this last\nact Pecos did not let them interfere with his industry in any way. The\nethics of the cattle business will not stand too stern a scrutiny, even\nat this late date, and the joke on Old Crit was so primordial in its\nduplicity that it obscured the finer moral issues. Like many another\ncowman of those early days Pecos Dalhart had made his start with the\nrunning iron and with luck and judgment he might yet be a cattle king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE SHOW-DOWN\n\n\nIt is a great sensation to feel that you are a prospective cattle\nking, but somehow when Pecos Dalhart rode back to Verde Crossing\nhis accustomed gaiety had fled. There were no bows and smiles for\nMarcelina, no wordy exchanges with the garrulous Babe—there is a\ndifference, after all, between stealing cows for eighty dollars a month\nand stealing for yourself, and while a moralist might fail to see the\ndistinction it showed in its effect on Pecos's spirits.\n\n\"I'm goin' down to Geronimo,\" he grumbled, after an uneasy hour at\nthe store, during which he had tried in vain the cheering power of\nwhiskey; \"you can tell Crit I'll be back to-morrow night for my time,\"\nand without volunteering any further information he rode down to\nthe river, plunged across the rocky ford and was swallowed up in the\ndesert. Two days later he returned, red-eyed and taciturn, and to all\nBabe's inquiries he observed that the Geronimo saloons were the worst\ndeadfalls west of the Rio Grande, for a certainty. His mood did not\nimprove by waiting, and when Crittenden finally rode in after his long\nday's work he demanded his money so brusquely that even that old-timer\nwas startled.\n\n\"Well, sho, sho, boy,\" he soothed, \"don't git excited over nothin'!\nTo be sure I'll pay you your money.\" He went down into his overalls\nwith commendable promptitude, but Pecos only watched him in surly\nsilence. Something in his pose seemed to impress the shifty cowman; he\ndrew forth a roll of bills and began to count them out, reluctantly.\n\"Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a hundred—there it is—now what's all\nthis racket about?\"\n\n\"Nothin',\" responded Pecos, stowing away the greenbacks, \"but you can\ngit somebody else to finish up that job.\"\n\n\"Well, here,\" snapped the cowman, warming up a little as Dalhart cooled\ndown, \"don't I git no accountin' for this month's work? How many did\nyou brand and what you quittin' for?\"\n\n\"I branded sixty-seven cows, fifty-five calves, and thirty\ntwo-year-olds,\" replied the cowboy, boldly, and Crittenden, not knowing\nin what iron they were branded, chuckled gleefully.\n\n\"Umm,\" he murmured, \"wall, say now, that ain't so bad. Old Upton will\nmake a buck-jump at the moon when he finds this out. But lookee here,\nboy, I'm goin' to be driftin' cows into that country for another month\nyet, and that'll be as long as we can brand and ear-mark on account\nof the flies in June. Now I want to make a dicker with you for jest\none more month and I'll be generous with you—how about a hundred and\nten—that's pretty nigh four months' wages for a cow-punch!\"\n\n\"No, I've done quit!\" protested Pecos, vigorously. \"Steal your own\ncattle! When I want to go into the rustlin' business I'll rustle for\nmyse'f!\"\n\n\"Jest one more month,\" insisted Old Crit, \"I'll give you a hundred and\ntwenty!\"\n\nThe cowboy looked at him a minute and smiled sneeringly. \"Well, bein'\nas yore money seems to be burnin' a hole in yore pocket,\" he said, \"I\nguess I'll have to take it away from you, but I'll tell you right now\nI don't approve of this cow-stealin'—it's likely to git a man into\ntrouble!\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said Crittenden, making haste to clinch the\nbargain, \"a hundred and twenty, then; and they hain't nobody ever been\nconvicted in Geronimo County yet for stealin' cows, so you don't need\nto worry none. Pull your freight, now, and I'll be over later on to see\nwhat you've done.\"\n\nAs Pecos Dalhart and José Garcia rode up the Carrizo trail the next\nmorning driving their pack animals before them, the conversation was\nchiefly between José and his mules. Pecos did not approve of Mexicans\nand José did not approve of Pecos—he had been making love to his girl,\nMarcelina. But about a mile out of Verde Crossing they came across an\nobject that was worthy of comment—an old cow and her calf, both so\ncuriously marked that no cowboy could pass them unnoticed. The cow was\ncovered from shoulder to flank with minute red and white spots and,\nplastered generously across her face, was a variegated blotch of the\ncreamy dun color peculiar to Chihuahua stock. The calf was like its\nmother, even to the dun face and spotted neck and ears, but she, on\naccount of her brand and ear-marks, held the entire attention of the\nTexan.\n\n\"What brand you call that, Joe?\" he inquired, as the old cow\ncontemplated them from the hillside.\n\n\"_Mi fiero!_\" exclaimed the Mexican, proudly tapping himself on the\nchest.\n\n\"Oh, it's yourn, is it?\" commented Pecos. \"Looks like an Injun arrer\nstruck by lightnin', don't it? Well, these Mexican irons are too many\nfor me—I see you got winders in her ears!\"\n\n\"You bet,\" assented Joe, \"that my mark, un _ventano_, un slash, un\n_anzuelo_!\"\n\n\"A window, a slash, and an underbit, hey—you don't figure on anybody\nstealin' _her_, unless they cut 'er ears off, do you? How many cows you\ngot?\"\n\n\"Oh, six—eight,\" answered José, pride of possession loosening up his\ntongue, \"this good milk cow.\"\n\n\"Milk cow, eh?\" repeated Pecos, and then he stopped and pondered a\nwhile. Only the day before he had recorded his Monkey-wrench brand at\nGeronimo, although he did not have an honestly acquired cow in the\nworld—here was a chance to cover his hand. \"How much you take for cow,\nJoe?\" he asked. \"I like milk, my camp.\"\n\n\"You take calf too?\" inquired the Mexican, shrewdly.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Pecos, \"give you twenty dollars for the cow and ten for\nthe calf!\" He drew a roll of bills from his pocket and began to peel\nthem off temptingly.\n\n\"You geev twenty-five for cow,\" suggested Joe, his slow wits beginning\nto move at the sight of real money.\n\n\"All right,\" said Pecos, briskly, \"I'll give you twenty-five for the\ncow and five for the calf—but you have to give me bill of sale.\"\n\n\"_Stawano_,\" assented the Mexican, \"and I vent her when we geet to\ncamp, too. Dam' Ol' Crit,\" he observed, as he pocketed the money, \"I\nwork for heem long time—he make me take trade een store—all time in\ndebt!\"\n\nHe threw the spotted cow and calf in with the pack animals and when\nthey had arrived at Carrizo Springs he roped her and, true to his\npromise, ran his Indian arrow brand on her shoulder, thus making her a\nliving document and memorandum of sale. In the cow country that \"vent\"\non the shoulder is the only bill of sale required, but Pecos drew up a\nformal paper giving the ear-marks and brand, and after Joe had signed\nit and gone he roped Old Funny-face again and ran a Monkey-wrench\non her ribs beneath the original mark, all of which is strictly\naccording to law. After that he herded her close, letting the little\nMonkey-wrench calf have all the milk, while he waited expectantly for\nOld Crit to drop in.\n\nAt the beginning of his long month of waiting Pecos Dalhart was\nwatchful and conservative. He branded up all the cattle that had\ndrifted into Lost Dog Cañon, drove them down into his hidden pasture\nand closed the breach in his drift fence—then he moved back to Carrizo\nand went soberly about his work. Old Funny-face and her spotted calf\nwere the only Monkey-wrench cows at Carrizo Springs and though he held\na bill of sale for them Pecos was finally compelled to drive them\nover the trail to his Lost Dog pasture in order to keep them from\nsneaking back home to Verde Crossing and tipping his hand prematurely\nto Isaac Crittenden. He was a hard man, Old Crit, especially when his\npocket-book was touched, and Pecos looked for a gunplay when the Boss\nfinally found him out; but if Crittenden got wind of his duplicity in\nadvance he might come over with all his Texas cowboys and wipe Mr.\nPecos Dalhart off the map. So at the start he was careful, running\nnothing but Wine-glasses on the U cows that still came drifting in\nover the mountains, but as the days went by and his courage mounted up\nagainst the time when he was to face Old Crit a spirit of bravado crept\nin on him and made him over-bold. All he wanted now was a show-down,\nand he wanted it quick—one Monkey-wrench brand would tell the story.\nWith a sardonic grin Pecos put his rope on a likely young maverick and\nburned a Monkey-wrench on his ribs; then, in order that there should be\nno mistake, he worked over the brand on a U cow and put his iron on the\ncalf. As the last days of the month dragged by and the fighting spirit\nwithin him clamored for action he threw caution to the winds, running a\nMonkey-wrench on every cow-brute he caught.\n\nFor weeks Pecos had watched the brow of the hill where the Verde trail\ncame in, and he wore his six-shooter constantly, even at his branding,\nbut when at last Crittenden finally rode in on him he was so intent\nabout his work that he almost overlooked him. Only the fidgeting of\nhis horse, which was holding the rope taut on a big U cow that he had\nstrung out, saved him from being surprised at his task and taken at\na disadvantage. One glance was enough—it was Crit, and he was alone.\nPecos stood up and looked at him as he came slowly down the hill—then,\nas the cow struggled to get up, he seized his running iron from the\nfire, spread a wet sack over her brand, and burned a big Monkey-wrench\nthrough the steaming cloth.\n\n\"Hello!\" hailed the cowman, spurring eagerly in on him. \"Are you\ncatchin' many?\"\n\n\"Oodles of 'em!\" answered Pecos, loosening his tie-down strings and\nswinging up on his horse. \"Git up there, cow, and show yourse'f off\nto the Boss!\" He slackened the taut reata that was fastened around\nher hind feet and as the old cow sprang up, shaking off the sack, the\nsmoking Monkey-wrench on her ribs stood out like hand-writing on the\nwall.\n\n\"Wh-what's that?\" gasped Crit, staring at the mark. \"I thought I told\nyou to run a Wine-glass!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" assented Pecos, dropping his hand to his hip, \"but\nI got tired of runnin' your old brand, so I studied out a little\nimprovement!\"\n\nHe laughed hectoringly as he spoke and the realization of the fraud\nthat had been perpetrated upon him made Crittenden reel in the saddle.\n\n\"Hev—hev you recorded that brand?\" he demanded, tensely.\n\n\"I certainly have,\" responded Pecos, \"and I didn't see no Wine-glass\nregistered before me, neither. If I'd been real foxy, like some people\nI know, I would've put that in the book too and euchered you out of the\nwhole bunch. But I'm good-natured, Mr. Crittenden, and bein' as I\nwas takin' your money I branded most of these U cows in the Wine-glass.\nI hope you'll be able to take this reasonable.\"\n\n\"Reasonable!\" screamed Crittenden, \"reasonable! W'y, if I wasn't the\nmost reasonable man on earth I'd shoot you so full of lead it'd take a\nwagon to haul you to the graveyard. But you don't know who you're up\nagainst, boy, if you think you can fool me like this—the man don't live\nthat can give Ike Crittenden the double cross. I been in the business\ntoo long. Now I give you jest five minutes to make me out a bill of\nsale for your entire brand, whatever you call it. Ef you _don't_—\"\n\nHe rose up threateningly in his stirrups and his one good eye glared\nbalefully, but Pecos had been expecting something like this for a month\nor more and he did not weaken.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he said, \"my brand is the Monkey-wrench; I come by it as\nhonest as you come by the Wine-glass, and I'll fight for it. If you\ncrowd me too hard, I'll shoot; and if you try to run me out of the\ncountry I'll give the whole snap away to Upton.\"\n\n\"W'y, you son of a—\" began the cowman malignantly, but he did not\nspecify. Pecos's ever-ready pistol was out and balanced in his hand.\n\n[Illustration: Pecos's ever-ready pistol was out and balanced in his\nhand]\n\n\"That'll do, Mr. Crittenden,\" he said, edging his horse in closer. \"I\nnever took that off o' nobody yet, and 'tain't likely I'll begin with\nyou. If you're lookin' for trouble you'll find I can accommodate you,\nany time—but listen to reason, now. This ain't the first time a cowman\nhas got himse'f into trouble by hirin' somebody else to do his stealin'\nfor him—I've been around some, and I know. But they ain't no use of us\nfightin' each other—we're both in the same line of business. You leave\nme alone and I'll keep shut about this—is it a go?\"\n\nThe fires of inextinguishable hate were burning in Old Crit's eye and\nhis jaw trembled as he tried to talk.\n\n\"Young man,\" he began, wagging a warning finger at his enemy, \"young\nman—\" He paused and cursed to himself fervently. \"How much will you\ntake for your brand?\" he cried, trying to curb his wrath, \"and agree to\nquit the country?\"\n\n\"I ain't that kind of a hold-up,\" replied Pecos, promptly. \"I like this\ncountry and I'm goin' to live here. They's two or three hundred head of\ncattle running in here that I branded for you for a hundred and eighty\ndollars. They're worth two or three thousand. I've got a little bunch\nmyself that I picked up on the side, when I wasn't stealin' for you.\nNow all I ask is to be left alone, and I'll do the same by you. Is it a\ngo?\"\n\nThe cold light of reason came into Crittenden's fiery orb and glittered\nlike the hard finish of an agate.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, grudgingly, \"well—oh hell, yes!\" He urged his horse\nsullenly up the hill. \"Another one of them smart Texicans,\" he\nmuttered, \"but I'll cure him of suckin' eggs before I'm through with\n'im.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nLOST DOG CAÑON\n\n\nThe silence of absolute loneliness lay upon Lost Dog Cañon like a pall\nand to Pecos Dalhart, sprawling in the door of his cave, it seemed as\nif mysterious voices were murmuring to each other behind the hollow\ngurgling of the creek. From far down the cañon the bawling of cows,\nchafing against the drift fence, echoed with dreary persistence among\nthe cliffs, and the deep subterranean rumbling which gave the place\nits bad name broke in upon his meditations like the stirring of some\nuneasy devil confined below. On the rim of the black cañon wall that\nrose against him a flock of buzzards sat in a tawdry row, preening\ntheir rusty feathers or hopping awkwardly about in petty, ineffectual\nquarrels—as shabby a set of loafers as ever basked in the sun. For\na week Pecos had idled about his cave, now building pole houses to\nprotect his provisions from the rats, now going out to the point to\nwatch the Verde trail, until the emptiness of it had maddened him. At\nfirst he had looked for trouble—the veiled treachery of some gun-man,\nhappening in on him accidentally, or an armed attack from Old Crit's\ncowboys—but now he would welcome the appearance of Crit himself. In\naction Pecos could trust his nerves absolutely, but he chafed at delay\nlike a spirited horse that frets constantly at the bit. If it was to\nbe a game of waiting Crittenden had won already. Pecos threw away his\ncigarette impatiently and hurried down the cañon to catch his horse.\n\n\"Where's Old Crit?\" he demanded when, after a long ride, he stalked\ndefiantly into the store at Verde Crossing.\n\n\"Damfino,\" replied Babe, looking up from a newspaper he was reading,\n\"gone down to Geronimo, I guess.\"\n\n\"Is he lookin' for me?\" inquired Pecos, guardedly.\n\n\"W'y, not so's you notice it,\" answered the bar-keeper, easily. \"It'd\nbe the first case on record, I reckon, bein' as he owes you money. In\nfact, until you collect your last month's pay the chances are good that\nyou'll be lookin' for him. Did you see the new sign over the door?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pecos, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Post Office!\" replied Babe, proudly. \"Yes, sir, Old Good Eye has\ncertainly knocked the persimmon this time and put Verde Crossing on the\nmap. They's lots of ranchers up and down the river—and you, of course,\nover there at Carrizo—and Crit figured it out some time ago that if he\ncould git 'em to come here for their mail he'd catch their trade in\nwhiskey; so what does he do but apply to the Post Office Department for\na mail route from here to Geronimo and bid in the contract himself!\nHas to send Joe down about once a week, anyhow, you understand, and he\nmight as well git the Government to pay for it. So you can write home\nto your folks now to send your mail to Verde Crossing—tell your girl\ntoo, because if we don't git ten letters a week we lose our route.\"\n\nPecos twisted uneasily on his chair. Like many another good Texan he\nwas not writing home.\n\n\"Ain't got no girl,\" he protested, blushing beneath his tan.\n\n\"No?\" said Angy, \"well that's good news for Marcelina—she was inquirin'\nabout you the other day. But say, here's some advertisements in this\npaper that might interest you. Umm—lemme see, now—'Genuine Diamonds,\nrings, earrings, and brooches, dollar forty-eight a piece, to introduce\nour new line.' That's pretty cheap, ain't it! 'Always acceptable to\na lady,' it says. Yes, if you don't want 'em yourself you can give\n'em away, see? You know, I'm tryin' to git the fellers around here\ninterested, so's they'll write more letters.\"\n\nHe threw this out for a feeler and Pecos responded nobly. \"Well, go\nahead and order me them rings and earrings,\" he said, \"I'm no cheap\nsport. What else you got that's good?\"\n\nAngevine Thorne dropped his paper and reached stealthily for a large\nmail-order catalogue on the counter. \"Aprons, bath-tubs, curtains,\ndishes,\" he read, running his finger down the index. \"Here's some silk\nhandkerchiefs that might suit you; 'green, red, blue, and yaller, sixty\ncents each; with embroidered initials, twenty cents extra.'\"\n\n\"I'll go you!\" cried the cowboy, looking over his shoulder. \"Gimme half\na dozen of them red ones—no squaw colors for me—and say, lemme look at\nthem aprons.\"\n\n\"Aprons!\" yelled Angy. \"Well—what—the—\"\n\n\"Aw, shut up!\" snarled Pecos, blushing furiously. \"Can't you take a\njoke? Here, gimme that catalogue—you ain't the only man on the Verde\nthat can read and write—I've had some schoolin' myself!\"\n\nHe retired to a dark corner with the \"poor man's enemy\" and pored\nover it laboriously, scrawling from time to time upon an order blank\nwhich Angy had thoughtfully provided. At last the deed was done, all\nbut adding up the total, and after an abortive try or two the cowboy\nslipped in a twenty-dollar bill and wrote: \"Giv me the rest in blue\nhankerchefs branded M.\" Then he sealed and directed the letter and\ncalled on Babe for a drink.\n\n\"How long before I'll git them things?\" he inquired, his mind still\nheated with visions of aprons, jewelry, and blue handkerchiefs, branded\nM,—\"two or three weeks? Well, I'll be down before then—they might come\nsooner. Where's all the punchers?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're down in Geronimo, gettin' drunk. Round-up's over, now, and\nCrit laid 'em off. Gittin' kinder lonely around here.\"\n\n\"Lonely!\" echoed Pecos. \"Well, if you call this lonely you ought to\nbe out in Lost Dog Cañon, where I am. They's nothin' stirrin' there\nbut the turkey-buzzards—I'm gittin' the willies already, jest from\nlistenin' to myself think. Say, come on out and see me sometime, can't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Babe, \"if you knew all the things that Crit expects me\nto do in a day you'd wonder how I git time to shave. But say, what you\ndoin' out there, if it's a fair question?\"\n\n\"Who—me? Oh, I've made me a little camp over in that cave and I'm\ncatchin' them wild cattle that ooze along the creek.\" He tried to make\nit as matter-of-fact as possible, but Angevine Thorne knew better.\n\n\"Yes, I've heard of them wild cows,\" he drawled, slowly closing one\neye, \"the boys've been driftin' 'em over the Peaks for two months.\nFunny how they was all born with a U on the ribs, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Sure, but they's always some things you can't explain in a cow\ncountry,\" observed Pecos, philosophically. \"Did Crit tell you anything\nabout his new iron? No? Called the Wine-glass—in the brand book by this\ntime, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Aha! I see—I see!\" nodded Angy. \"Well, Old Good Eye wants to go easy\non this moonlightin'—we've got a new sheriff down here in Geronimo\nnow—Boone Morgan—and he was elected to put the fear of God into the\nhearts of these cowmen and make 'em respect the law. W'y, Crit won't\neven pay his taxes, he's that ornery. When the Geronimo tax-collector\nshows up he says his cows all run over in Tonto County; and when the\nTonto man finally made a long trip down here Crit told _him_ his\ncows all ran in Geronimo County, all but a hundred head or so, and\nJohn Upton had stole them. The tax-collectors have practically give\nup tryin' to do anything up here in the mountains—the mileage of the\nassessor and collector eats up all the profits to the county, and\nit's easier to turn these cowmen loose than it is to follow 'em up.\nThis here Geronimo man jumped all over Crit last time he was up here,\nbut Crit just laughed at him. 'Well,' he says, 'if you don't like the\nfiggers I give, you better go out on the range and count them cows\nyourself, you're so smart.' And what could the poor man do? It'd cost\nmore to round up Old Crit's cattle than the taxes would come to in a\nlifetime. But you want to look out, boy,\" continued Angy earnestly,\n\"how you monkey around with them U cattle—Boone Morgan is an old-timer\nin these parts and he's likely to come over the hill some day and catch\nyou in the act.\"\n\n\"Old Crit says they never was a man sent up in this county yet for\nstealin' cattle,\" ventured Pecos, lamely.\n\n\"Sure not,\" assented Angevine Thorne, \"but they's been a whole lot of\n'em killed for it! I don't suppose he mentioned that. Have you heard\nabout this Tewkesbury-Graham war that's goin' on up in Pleasant Valley?\nThat all started over rustlin' cattle, and they's over sixty men killed\nalready and everybody hidin' out like thieves. A couple of Crit's bad\npunchers came down through there from the Hash-knife and they said\nit was too crude for them—everybody fightin' from ambush and killin'\nmen, women, and children. I tell you, it's got the country stirred up\nturrible— that's how come Boone Morgan was elected sheriff. The people\ndown in Geronimo figured out if they didn't stop this stealin' and\nrustlin' and alterin' brands pretty soon, Old Crit and Upton would lock\nhorns—or some of these other cowmen up here in the mountains—and the\ncounty would go bankrupt like Tonto is, with sheriff's fees and murder\ntrials. No, sir, they ain't been enough law up here on the Verde to\nintimidate a jackrabbit so far—it's all down there in Geronimo, where\nthey give me that life sentence for conspicuous drunkenness—but you\nwant to keep your ear to the ground, boy, because you're goin' to hear\nsomething drap!\"\n\n\"What d'ye think's goin' to happen, Babe?\" asked the cowboy, uneasily.\n\"Old Crit can't be scared very bad—he's laid off all his punchers.\"\n\n\"Huh! you don't know Crit as well as I do,\" commented Babe. \"Don't\nyou know those punchers would've quit anyhow, as soon as they got\ntheir pay? He does that every year—lays 'em off and then goes down\nto Geronimo about the time they're broke, and half of 'em in jail,\nmebby, and bails 'em out. He'll have four or five of 'em around here\nall summer, workin' for nothin' until the fall round-up comes off. I\ntell you, that man'll skin a flea anytime for the hide and taller. You\nwant to keep out of debt to him or he'll make you into a Mexican peon,\nlike Joe Garcia over here. Joe's been his corral boss and teamster\nfor four years now and I guess they's a hundred dollars against him\non the books, right now. Will drink a little whiskey once in a while,\nyou know, like all the rest of us, and the Señora keeps sendin' over\nfor sugar and coffee and grub, and somehow or other, Joe is always\npayin' for a dead horse. Wouldn't be a Mexican, though,\" observed Babe,\nphilosophically, \"if he wasn't in debt to the store. A Mexican ain't\nhappy until he's in the hole a hundred or so—then he can lay back and\nsojer on his job and the boss is afraid to fire 'im. There's no use of\nhis havin' anything, anyhow—his relatives would eat 'im out of house\nand home in a minute. There was a Mexican down the river here won the\ngrand prize in a lottery and his relatives come overland from as far as\nSonora to help him spend the money. Inside of a month he was drivin'\na wood-wagon again in order to git up a little grub. He was a big man\nwhile it lasted—open house day and night, _fiestas_ and _bailes_ and a\nstring band to accompany him wherever he went—but when it was all over\nold Juan couldn't buy a pint of whiskey on credit if he was snake-bit.\nThey're a great people, for sure.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" assented Pecos, absently, \"but say, I reckon I'll be\ngoin'.\" The social qualities of the Spanish-Americans did not interest\nhim just then—he was thinking about Boone Morgan. \"Gimme a dollar's\nworth of smoking tobacco and a box of forty-fives and I'll hit the\nroad.\"\n\n\"There's one thing more you forgot,\" suggested Angevine Thorne, as he\nwrapped up the purchases.\n\n\"What—Marcelina?\" ventured Pecos, faintly.\n\n\"Naw—your _mail_!\" cried Angy, scornfully, and dipping down into a\ncracker box he brought out a paper on the yellow wrapper of which was\nprinted \"Pecos Dalhart, Verde Crossing, Ariz.\"\n\n\"_I_ never subscribed for no paper!\" protested Pecos, turning it over\nsuspiciously. \"Here—I don't want it.\"\n\n\"Ump-umm,\" grunted Angy, smiling mysteriously, \"take it along. All the\nboys git one. You can read it out in camp. Well, if you're goin' to be\nbull-headed about it I'll tell you. Crit subscribed for it for every\nman in Verde—only cost two-bits a year. Got to build up this mail route\nsomehow, you know. It's called the _Voice of Reason_ and it's against\nthe capitalistic classes.\"\n\n\"The which?\" inquired Pecos, patiently.\n\n\"Aw, against rich fellers—these sharks like Old Crit that's crushin'\nthe life outer the common people. That's the paper I was showin'\nyou—where they was advertisin' diamonds for a dollar forty-eight a\npiece.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Pecos, thrusting it into his chaps, \"why didn't you say so\nbefore? Sure, I'll read it!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"THE VOICE OF REASON\"\n\n\nThe fierce heat of summer fell suddenly upon Lost Dog Cañon and all the\nVerde country—the prolonged heat which hatches flies by the million\nand puts an end to ear-marking and branding. Until the cool weather\nof October laid them and made it possible to heal a wound there was\nnothing for Pecos to do but doctor a few sore ears and read the _Voice\nof Reason_. Although he had spent most of his life in the saddle the\nschool-teacher back on the Pecos had managed to corral him long enough\nto beat the three R's into him and, being still young, he had not yet\nhad time to forget them. Only twenty summers had passed over his head,\nso far, and he was a man only in stature and the hard experience of his\ncraft. He was a good Texan—born a Democrat and taught to love whiskey\nand hate Mexicans—but so far his mind was guiltless of social theory.\nThat there was something in the world that kept a poor man down he\nknew, vaguely; but never, until the _Voice of Reason_ brought it to his\nattention, had he heard of the conspiracy of wealth or the crime of\ngovernment. Not until, sprawling at the door of his cave, he mumbled\nover the full-mouthed invective of that periodical had he realized what\na poor, puny creature a wage-slave really was, and when he read of the\nlegalized robbery which went on under the name of law his young blood\nboiled in revolt. The suppression of strikes by Pinkertons, the calling\nout of the State Militia to shoot down citizens, the blacklisting of\nminers, and the general oppression of workingmen was all far away and\nacademic to him—the thing that gripped and held him was an article on\nthe fee system, under which officers of the law arrest all transient\ncitizens who are unfortunate enough to be poor, and judges condemn them\nin order to gain a fee.\n\n\"_Think, Slave, Think!_\" it began. \"You may be the next innocent man to\nbe thrown into some vile and vermin-infested county-jail to swell the\nincome of the bloated minions who fatten upon the misery of the poor!\"\n\nPecos had no difficulty in thinking. Like many another man of\nwandering habits he had already tasted the bitterness of \"ten dollars\nor ten days.\" The hyenas of the law had gathered him in while he was\ninnocently walking down the railroad track and a low-browed justice of\nthe peace without asking any useless questions had sentenced him to\njail for vagrancy. Ten days of brooding and hard fare had not sweetened\nhis disposition any and he had stepped free with the firm determination\nto wreak a notable revenge, but as the sheriff thoughtfully kept his\nsix-shooter Pecos had been compelled to postpone that exposition of\npopular justice. Nevertheless the details of his wrongs were still\nfresh in his mind, and when he learned from the _Voice of Reason_\nthat the constable and judge had made him all that trouble for an\naggregate fee of six dollars Pecos was ready to oppose all law, in\nwhatsoever form it might appear, with summary violence. And as for the\ncapitalistic classes—well, Pecos determined to collect his last month's\npay from Old Crit if he had to take it out of his hide.\n\nWhen next he rode into Verde Crossing the hang-dog look which had\npossessed Pecos Dalhart since he turned rustler was displaced by a\npurposeful frown. He rolled truculently in the saddle as he came down\nthe middle of the road, and wasted no time with preliminaries.\n\n\"Where's that blankety-blank Old Crit?\" he demanded, racking into the\nstore with his hand on his hip.\n\n\"Gone down to Geronimo to git the mail,\" replied Babe, promptly.\n\n\"Well, you tell him I want my pay!\" thundered Pecos, pacing up and down.\n\n\"He'll be back to-night, better stay and tell him yourself,\" suggested\nBabe, mildly.\n\n\"I'll do that,\" responded Pecos, nodding ominously. \"And more'n\nthat—I'll collect it. What's doin'?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothin',\" replied Babe. \"There was a deputy assessor up here the\nother day and he left this blank for you to fill out. It gives the\nnumber of your cattle.\"\n\n\"Well, you tell that deputy to go to hell, will you?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Babe, \"he might take me with him. It happens he's a deputy\nsheriff, too!\"\n\n\"Deputy,—_huh_!\" grumbled Pecos, morosely. \"They all look the same to\nme. Did Crit fill out his blank?\"\n\n\"Sure did. Reported a hundred head of Wine-glasses. Now what d'ye think\nof that?\"\n\nPecos paused and meditated on the matter for an instant. It was\ndoubtful if Crittenden could gather more than a hundred head of\nWine-glasses, all told. Some of them had drifted back to their old\nrange and the rest were scattered in a rough country. \"Looks like that\ndeputy threw a scare into him,\" he observed, dubiously. \"What did he\nsay about my cattle?\"\n\n\"Well, he said you'd registered a new brand and now it was up to you to\nshow that you had some cattle. If you've got 'em you ought to pay taxes\non 'em and if you haven't got any you got no business with an iron that\nwill burn over Upton's U.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the racket, is it? Well, you tell that deputy that I've got\ncattle in that brand and I've got a bill of sale for 'em, all regular,\nbut I've yet to see the deputy sheriff that can collect taxes off of\nme. D'ye think I'm goin' to chip in to help pay the salary of a man\nthat makes a business of rollin' drunks and throwin' honest workingmen\ninto the hoosegatho when he's in town? Ump-um—guess again!\"\n\nHe motioned for a drink and Babe regarded him curiously as he set out\nthe bottle.\n\n\"You been readin' the _Voice_, I reckon,\" he said, absent-mindedly\npouring out a drink for himself. \"Well, say, did you read that article\non the fee system? It's all true, Pardner, every word of it, and more!\nI'm a man of good family and education—I was brought up right and my\nfolks are respectable people—and yet every time I go to Geronimo they\nthrow me into jail. Two-twenty-five, that's what they do it for—and\nthere I have to lay, half the time with some yegg or lousy gang of\nhobos, until they git ready to turn me loose. And they call that\njustice! Pecos, I'm going back to Geronimo—I'm going to stand on the\ncorner, just the way I used to when I was drunk, and tell the people\nit's all _wrong_! You're a good man, Pecos—Cumrad—will you go with me?\"\n\nPecos stood and looked at him, wondering. \"Comrade\" sounded good to\nhim; it was the word they used in the _Voice of Reason_—\"Comrade Jones\nhas just sent us in four more subscriptions. That's what throws a crook\ninto the tail of monopoly. Bully for you, Comrade!\" But with all his\nfervor he did not fail to notice the droop to Angy's eyes, the flush on\nhis cheeks, and the slack tremulousness of his lips—in spite of his\nsolemn resolutions Angy had undoubtedly given way to the Demon Drink.\n\n\"Nope,\" he said, \"I like you, Angy, but they'd throw us both in. You'd\nbetter stay up here and watch me put it on Crit. 'Don't rope a bigger\nbull than you can throw,' is my motto, and Old Crit is jest my size.\nI'm goin' to comb his hair with a six-shooter or I'll have my money—and\nthen if that dog-robber of a deputy sheriff shows up I'll—well, he'd\nbetter not crowd me, that's all. Here's to the revolution—will you\ndrink it, old Red-eye?\"\n\nAngy drank it, and another to keep it company.\n\n\"Pecos,\" he said, his voice tremulous with emotion, \"when I think how\nmy life has been ruined by these hirelings of the law, when I think\nof the precious days I have wasted in the confinement of the Geronimo\njail, I could rise up and _destroy_ them, these fiends in human form\nand their accursed jails; I could wreck every prison in the land\nand proclaim liberty from the street-corners—whoop!\" He waved one\nhand above his head, laughed, and leapt to a seat upon the bar. \"But\ndon't you imagine f'r a moment, my friend,\" he continued, with the\nimpressive gravity of an orator, \"that they have escaped unscathed.\nIt was not until I had read that wonderful champion of the common\npeople, the _Voice of Reason_, that I realized the enormity of this\nconspiracy which has reduced me to my present condition, but from\nmy first incarceration in the Geronimo jail I have been a Thorne in\ntheir side, as the Geronimo _Blade_ well said. I remember as if it\nwere yesterday the time when they erected their first prison, over\ntwenty years ago, on account of losing some hoss-thieves. It was a new\nstructure, strongly built of adobe bricks, and in a spirit of jest the\ntown marshal arrested me and locked me up to see if it was tight. That\nnight when all was still I wrenched one of the iron bars loose and dug\nmy way to freedom! But what is freedom to revenge? After I had escaped\nI packed wood in through the same hole, piled it up against the door,\nand set the dam' hell-hole afire!\"\n\nHe paused and gazed upon Pecos with drunken triumph. \"That's the kind\nof an _hombre_ I am,\" he said. \"But what is one determined man against\na thousand? When the citizens of Geronimo beheld their new calaboose\nruined and in flames they went over the country with a fine-tooth comb\nand never let up until they had brought me back and shackled me to\nthe old Cottonwood log down by the canal—the one they had always used\nbefore they lost the hoss-thieves. That was the only jail they had\nleft, now that the calaboose was burned. In vain I pleaded with them\nfor just one drink—they were inexorable, the cowardly curs, and there\nthey left me, chained like a beast, while they went up town and swilled\nwhiskey until far into the night. As the first faint light of morning\nshot across the desert I awoke with a terrible thirst. My suffering\nwas awful. I filled my mouth with the vile ditch-water and spat it out\nagain, unsatisfied—I shook my chains and howled for mercy. But what\nmercy could one expect from such a pack of curs? I tested every link\nin my chain, and the bolt that passed through the log—then, with the\nstrength of desperation I laid hold upon that enormous tree-trunk and\nrolled it into the water! Yes, sir, I rolled the old jail-log into the\ncanal and jumped straddle of it like a conqueror, and whatever happened\nafter that I knew I had the laugh on old Hickey, the Town Marshal,\nunless some one saw me sailing by. But luck was with me, boy; I floated\nthat big log clean through town and down to Old Manuel's road-house—a\nMexican deadfall out on the edge of the desert—and swapped it for two\ndrinks of mescal that would simply make you scream! By Joe, that liquor\ntasted good—have one with me now!\"\n\nThey drank once more, still pledging the revolution, and then Angy\nwent ahead on his talking jag. \"Maybe you've heard of this Baron\nMun-chawson, the German character that was such a dam' liar and\njail-breaker the king made a prison to order and walled him in? Well,\nsir, Mun-chawson worked seven years with a single nail on that prison\nand dug out in spite of hell. But human nature's the same, wherever\nyou go—always stern and pitiless. When those Geronimo citizens found\nout that old Angy had stole their cottonwood log and traded it to a\nwood-chopper for the drinks, they went ahead and built a double-decked,\nsteel-celled county jail and sentenced me to it for life! Conspicuous\ndrunkenness was the charge—and grand larceny of a jail—but answer me,\nmy friend, is this a free country or is the spirit that animated our\nforefathers dead? Is the spirit of Patrick Henry when he cried, 'Give\nme liberty or give me death,' buried in the oblivion of the past? Tell\nme that, now!\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" responded Pecos, lightly, \"too deep a question for me—but\nsay, gimme one more drink and then I'm goin' down the road to collect\nmy pay from Crit. I'm a man of action—that's where I shine—I refer\nall such matters to Judge Colt.\" He slapped his gun affectionately\nand clanked resolutely out of the door. Half a mile down the river\nhe sighted his quarry and rode in on him warily. Old Crit was alone,\ndriving a discouraged team of Mexican horses, and as the bouquet of\nPecos's breath drifted in to him over the front wheel the Boss of Verde\nCrossing regretted for once the fiery quality of his whiskey.\n\n\"I come down to collect my pay,\" observed Pecos, plucking nervously at\nhis gun.\n\n\"Well, you don't collect a cent off of me,\" replied Crit, defiantly, \"a\nman that will steal the way you did! Whenever you git ready to leave\nthis country I might give you a hundred or so for your brand, but you\nbetter hurry up. There was a deputy sheriff up here the other day,\nlookin' for you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard about it,\" sneered Pecos. \"I reckon he was lookin' for\nevidence about this here Wine-glass iron.\"\n\nA smothered curse escaped the lips of Isaac Crittenden, but, being old\nat the game, he understood. There was nothing for it but to pay up—and\nwait.\n\n\"Well, what guarantee do I git that you don't give the whole snap\naway anyhow?\" he demanded, fiercely. \"What's the use of me payin' you\nanything—I might as well keep it to hire a lawyer.\"\n\n\"As long as you pay me what you owe me,\" said Pecos, slowly, \"and\ntreat me square,\" he added, \"I keep my mouth shut. But the minute you\ngit foxy or try some ranikaboo play like sayin' the deputy was after\nme—look out! Now they was a matter of a hundred and twenty dollars\nbetween us—do I git it or don't I?\"\n\n\"You git it,\" grumbled Crittenden, reluctantly. \"But say, I want you\nto keep away from Verde Crossing. Some of them Wine-glass cows have\ndrifted back onto the upper range and John Upton has made a roar. More\nthan that, Boone Morgan has undertook to collect our taxes up here and\nif that deputy of his ever gits hold of you he's goin' to ask some\nmighty p'inted questions. So you better stay away, see?\"\n\nHe counted out the money and held it in his hand, waiting for consent,\nbut Pecos only laughed.\n\n\"Life's too short to be hidin' out from a deputy,\" he answered,\nshortly. \"So gimme that money and I'll be on my way.\" He leaned over\nand plucked the bills from Crit's hand; then, spurring back toward the\nCrossing he left Old Crit, speechless with rage, to follow in his dust.\n\nA loud war-whoop from the store and the high-voiced ranting of\nBabe made it plain to Crit that there was no use going there—Angy\nwas launched on one of his periodicals and Pecos was keeping him\ncompany—which being the case there was nothing for it but to let them\ntake the town. The grizzled Boss of Verde stood by the corral for a\nminute, listening to the riot and studying on where to put in his time;\nthen a slow smile crept over his hardened visage and he fixed his\nsinister eye on the adobe of Joe Garcia. All was fair, with him, in\nlove or war, and Marcelina was growing up to be a woman.\n\n\"Joe,\" he said, turning upon his corral boss, \"you tell your wife I'll\nbe over there in a minute for supper—and say, I want you to stay in the\nstore to-night; them crazy fools will set the house afire.\"\n\n\"_Stawano_,\" mumbled José, but as he turned away there was an angry\nglint in his downcast eye and he cursed with every breath. It is not\nalways pleasant, even to a Mexican, to be in debt to the Boss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE REVOLUTION\n\n\nThe coyotes who from their seven hills along the Verde were accustomed\nto make Rome howl found themselves outclassed and left to a thinking\npart on the night that Pecos Dalhart and Angevine Thorne celebrated\nthe dawn of Reason. The French Revolution being on a larger scale,\nand, above all, successful, has come down in history as a great social\nmovement; all that can be said of the revolution at Verde Crossing\nis packed away in those sad words: it failed. It started, like most\nrevolutions, with a careless word, hot from the vitriolic pen of some\nspace-writer gone mad, and ended in that amiable disorder which, for\nlack of a better word, we call anarchy. Whiskey was at the bottom of\nit, of course, and it meant no more than a tale told by an idiot,\n\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" At the same time, it\nmanaged by degrees to engross the entire attention of Verde Crossing\nand after the fall of the Bastile, as symbolized by the cracking of a\nbottle, it left Pecos and Babe more convinced than ever that the world\nwas arrayed against them.\n\nIn the early part of the evening, according to orders, José Garcia\nwatched them furtively through the open door, returning at intervals,\nhowever, to peer through the window of his own home. At each visit\nit seemed to him that Angy was getting drunker and the Boss more\nshameless in his attentions to Marcelina. At last, when he could stand\nthe strain no longer, he threw in with the merry roisterers, leaving\nit to the Señora to protect the dignity of their home. A drink or\ntwo mellowed him to their propaganda—at the mention of Crit he burst\ninto a torrent of curses and as the night wore on he declared for the\nrevolution, looking for his immediate revenge in drinking up all the\nBoss's whiskey. In the end their revelry rose to such a height that\nCrittenden was drawn away from his rough wooing and finally, under the\npretence of delivering the United States mail, he walked boldly in upon\nthem, determined to protect his property at any risk. The penalty for\ninterfering with the United States mail, as everybody who has ever read\nthe card on a drop-box knows, is a fine of $1,000, or imprisonment, or\nboth. In defence of that precious packet Crittenden could have killed\nall three of them and stood justified before the law, but although he\nhad a reputation as a bad man to crowd into a corner, Old Crit was not\nof a sanguinary disposition. No man could hold down a bunch of gun-men\nof the kind that he employed in his predatory round-ups and not have a\nlittle iron in his blood, but the Boss of Verde Crossing had seen all\ntoo well in his variegated career the evils which cluster like flies\nabout an act of violence, and he was always for peace—peace and his\nprice.\n\n\"Here; here, here,\" he expostulated, as he found Angy in the act of\ndrinking half a pint of whiskey by measure, \"you boys are hittin' it\npretty high, ain't ye?\"\n\n\"The roof's the limit,\" replied Babe, facetiously. \"As the Champeen\nBooze-fighter of Arizona I am engaged in demonstratin' to all beholders\nmy claim to that illustrious title. Half a pint of whiskey—enough to\nkill an Injun or pickle a Gila-monster—and all tossed off at a single\nbout, like the nectar of the gods. Here's to the revolution, and to\nhell with the oppressors of the poor!\"\n\n\"That's right,\" chimed in Pecos, elevating his glass and peering\nsavagely over its rim at the Boss, \"we done declared a feud against\nthe capitulistic classes and the monneypullistic tendencies of the\ntimes. Your game's played out, Old Man; the common people have riz in\ntheir might and took the town! Now you go away back in the corner,\nd'ye understand, and sit down—and don't let me hear a word out of you\nor I'll beat the fear o' God into you with _this_!\" He hauled out his\nheavy six-shooter and made the sinister motions of striking a man over\nthe head with it, but Crit chose to ignore the threat.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, feigning an indulgent smile, \"you boys seem to\nbe enjoyin' yourselves, so I'll jest deliver this United States mail\nas the law requires and leave you to yourselves.\" He stepped in behind\nthe bar, chucked a couple of demijohns of whiskey into the corner where\nthey might be overlooked, and threw the mail pouch on the counter.\n\n\"Better come up and git your mail, boys,\" he observed, dumping\nthe contents out for a lure. \"Hey, here's a package for you, Mr.\nDalhart—something pretty choice, I 'spect. Nothin' for you, Joe,\" he\nscowled, as his faithless retainer lurched up to claim his share.\n\"Here's your paper, Babe. Letter for you, Mr. Dalhart,\" he continued,\nflipping a large, official envelope across the bar, \"you're developin'\nquite a correspondence!\" He ducked down behind the counter, grinning at\nhis stratagem, and while Pecos and Babe were examining their mail he\nmanaged to jerk the money drawer open and slip the loose change into\nhis pockets.\n\n\"Well, we'll be goin' home now, Joe,\" he said, taking the corral\nboss briskly by the arm. \"Come on, _hombre_, you ain't got no mail!\"\nUnder ordinary circumstances José would have followed peaceably, thus\nreducing the revolutionary forces to a minimum, but the covert insult\nto his daughter, magnified by drink, had fired his Latin blood.\n\n\"No, Señor,\" he replied, fixing his glittering eyes upon the hateful\nboss. \"_Yo no go! Carramba, que malo hombre!_ You dam' coward,\nCreet—you scare my wife—you scare—\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" hissed Crit, hastily cuffing him over the head. \"Shut your\nmouth or I'll—\"\n\n\"_Diablo!_\" shrieked the Mexican, striking back blindly. \"I keel you!\nYou have to leave _mi niña_ alone!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" yelled Angevine Thorne, leaping with drunken impetuosity\ninto the fray, \"hev you been—\"\n\n\"Leave him to me!\" shouted Pecos, wading recklessly into\nthe scrimmage. \"I'll fix the blankety-blank, whatever\nhe's gone and done! Throw him loose, boys; I'll take the\n_one-eyed_—_hump-backed_—_dog-robbin'_—_dastard_\"—he accompanied each\nepithet with a blow—\"and tie 'im into a bow knot!\" He grabbed Old Crit\nout of the _mêlée_ and held him against the wall with a hand of iron.\n\"What do you mean by slappin' my friend and cumrad?\" he thundered,\nmaking as if to annihilate him with a blow. \"I want you to understand,\nOld Cock Eye, that Mr. Garcia is my friend—he comes from a fine old\nSpanish family, away down in Sonory, and his rights must be respected!\nAin't that so, Angy?\"\n\n\"From the pure, Castilian blood,\" declaimed Angy, waving his hand\nlargely, \"a gentleman to whom I take off my hat—his estimable wife and\nfamily—\"\n\n\"Now here, boys,\" broke in Crittenden, taking his cue instantly, \"this\njoke has gone far enough. Mr. Garcia's wife asked me to bring him\nhome—you see what his condition is—and I was tryin' to do my best.\nNow jest take your hand off of me, Mr. Dalhart—yes, thanks—and Angy,\nyou see if you can't git 'im to go home. A man of family, you know,\" he\nwent on, craftily enlisting their sympathies, \"ought to—\"\n\n\"Sure thing!\" responded Angevine Thorne, lovingly twining his arm\naround his Spanish-American comrade. \"Grab a root there, Pecos, and\nwe'll take 'im home in style!\"\n\n\"Wait till I git my package!\" cried Pecos, suddenly breaking his hold,\nand he turned around just in time to see Crit skipping out the back\ndoor.\n\n\"Well, run then, you dastard!\" he apostrophized, waving one hand as he\ntenderly gathered up his mail-order dry goods. \"I can't stop to take\nafter ye now. This here package is f'r my little Señorita, Marcelina,\nand I'm goin' to present it like a gentleman and ast her for a kiss.\nHey, Angy,\" he called, as he re-engaged himself with José, \"how do you\nsay 'kiss' in Spanish? Aw, shut up, I don't believe ye! Stan' up here,\nJoe—well, it don't sound good, that's all—I'm goin' to ast her in U.\nS., and take a chance!\"\n\nThe procession lurched drunkenly up the road and like most such was not\nreceived with the cordiality which had been anticipated. The Señora\nGarcia was already furious at Old Crit and when Pecos Dalhart, after\ndelivering her recreant husband, undertook to present the dainty aprons\nand the blue handkerchiefs, marked M, which he had ordered specially\nfor her daughter, she burst into a torrent of Spanish and hurled them\nat his head. \"_Muy malo_,\" \"_borracho_,\" and \"_vaya se_,\" were a few of\nthe evil words which followed them and by the gestures alone Pecos knew\nthat he had been called a bad man and a drunkard and told in two words\nto go. He went, and with him Angy, ever ready to initiate new orgies\nand help drown his sorrows in the flowing cup. The noise of their\nbacchanalia rose higher and higher; pistol-shots rang out as Pecos shot\noff the necks of bottles which personified for the moment his hated\nrival; and to Crit, lingering outside the back door, it seemed as if\ntheir howling and ranting would never cease. It was no new experience\nfor him to break in on one of Angy's jags, but things were coming too\nhigh and fast with Pecos Dalhart present, and he decided to wait for\nhis revenge until they were both thoroughly paralyzed.\n\n\"But what is this 'cumrad' talk and them yells for the revolution?\" he\nsoliloquized, as Angy and Pecos returned to their religion. \"Is it a\nG. A. R. reunion or has Joe worked in a Mexican revolution on us? Yes,\nholler, you crazy fools; it'll be Old Crit's turn, when you come to pay\nthe bills.\"\n\nThe first gray light of dawn was striking through the door when\nCrittenden tip-toed cautiously into the store and gazed about at the\nwreckage and the sprawling hulks of the revellers. Pecos lay on his\nface with his huge silver mounted spurs tangled in the potato sack that\nhad thrown him; and Babe, his round moon-face and bald crown still\nred from his unrestrained potations, was draped along the bar like a\nshop kitten. Old Crit shook him roughly and, receiving no response,\nturned his attention to Pecos Dalhart. His first care was to snap the\ncartridges out of his six-shooter and jamb the action with a generous\nhandful of dirt; then he felt his pockets over carefully, looking for\nhis roll, for Pecos had undoubtedly consumed a great deal of liquor and\nought not to be deprived of the cowboy's privilege of waking up broke.\nBut as luck would have it he was lying upon his treasure and could\nnot pay his reckoning. The only article of interest which the search\nproduced was a grimy section of a newspaper, stored away in his vest\npocket, and Crit seized upon it eagerly. It was a not uncommon failing\nof Texas bad men, as he knew them, to carry newspaper accounts of their\npast misdeeds upon their persons and he unfolded the sheet with the\nfull expectation of finding a sheriff's offer of reward.\n\n\"_It's a crime to be Poor!!!_\" was the heading, \"And the penalty is\nhard labor for life!\" it added, briefly. There is something in that,\ntoo; but philosophy did not appeal to Crittenden at the moment—he was\nlooking for Pecos Dalhart's name and the record of his crime. \"The\ngrinding tyranny of the capitalistic classes—\" he read, and then his\neye ran down the page until he encountered the words: \"Yours for the\nRevolution!\" and \"Subscribe for the _Voice of Reason_!\" Then a great\nlight came over him and he gnashed his teeth in a fury.\n\n\"Well, the dam', yaller, two-bit-a-year sheet!\" he raved, snatching\na fresh copy of the _Voice of Reason_ from the sacred United States\nmail and hastily scanning its headlines, \"and if these crazy fools\nhain't gone and took it serious!\" He tore it in two and jumped on it.\n\"Two-bits a year!\" he raged, \"and for four-bits I could've got the\n_Fireside Companion_!\" He rummaged around in the box and gathered up\nevery copy, determined to hurl them into the fireplace, but on the way\nthe yellow wrapper with the United States stamp arrested his eye,\nand he paused. After all, they were United States mail—penalty for\ndestroying $1,000—and would have to go back into the box.\n\n\"Well,\" he grumbled, dumping them sullenly back, \"mebby it was that\nnew bar'l of whiskey—I s'pose they've got to holler about something\nwhen they're drunk, the dam' eejits!\" He strode up and down the floor,\nscowling at the unconscious forms of the roisterers who had beaten him\nthe night before—then he turned back and laid violent hands upon Angy.\n\n\"Git off'n there, you low-down, lazy hound!\" he yelled, dragging him\nroughly to the floor. \"You _will_ start a revolution and try to kill\nyour boss, will you? _You're fired!_\" he shouted when, after a liberal\ndrenching, he had brought Babe back to the world.\n\n\"Well, gimme my pay, then,\" returned Angy, holding out his hand and\nblinking.\n\n\"You don't git no pay!\" declared Crit, with decision. \"Who's goin' to\npay for all that liquor that was drunk last night? Look at them empty\nbottles, will you? You go and bring in all your friends and open up\nthe town and the next mornin' I look in the till and they ain't a dam'\ncent!\"\n\n\"Well, I want my pay,\" reiterated Babe, drunkenly. \"I been workin' a\nlong time, now—I'm goin' to draw my money an' go home! '_My mother's\nheart is breakin', breakin' f'r me, an' that's all_—'\" he crooned, and,\nrocking to and fro on the floor, he sang himself back to sleep.\n\nOld Crit watched him a moment, sneering; then with vindictive\nexultation he turned his attention to Pecos. \"Git up,\" he snarled,\nkicking the upturned soles of his feet, \"this ain't no bunk-house!\nGit out'r here, now; you been pesterin' around these parts too long!\"\nHe seized the prostrate cowboy by his broad shoulders and snaked him\nsummarily out the door, where he lay sprawling in the dirt, like\na turtle on its back, a mock of his strong, young manhood. To the\ncase-hardened Babe the venom of Old Crit's whiskey was no worse than\na death-potion of morphine to an opium fiend, but Pecos was completely\nparalyzed by the poison. He responded neither to kicks and man-handling\nnor to frequent dashes of water and at last Crittenden dragged him\nout behind the corral and left him there, a sight for gods and men.\nThe Garcia dogs crept up furtively and sniffed at him and the Señora\npointed him out to her children as an awful example of _Texano_\ndepravity, and also as the bad man who had corrupted their _papa_. Even\nMarcelina wavered in her secret devotion, but after he had finally\nclambered up on his horse and ridden blindly off toward Lost Dog Cañon\nthe thought of those blue silk handkerchiefs, branded M, rose up in her\nmind and comforted her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE DAY AFTER\n\n\nIn a land where the desert is king the prolonged absence of even so\nundesirable a citizen as Pecos Dalhart is sure, after a while, to\noccasion comment. For Pecos had ridden out on the Carrizo trail without\nwater, and the barren mesa had already claimed its dead from thirst.\nHe was also hardly in his right mind, and though his horse knew the\nway home he might easily have arrived there without his master. José\nGarcia was the first to mention the matter to Old Crit, and received a\nhearty cursing for his pains. Another week passed by, making three, and\nstill the cowboy did not come in for his mail. The bunch of dissipated\npunchers who lingered around the bunk-house under pretence of riding\nthe range finally worked up quite a hectic interest in the affair, but\nnone of them volunteered to make a search. The chances were that Mr.\nDalhart, if still alive, was in an ugly mood—perhaps locoed by Crit's\nwell-known brand of whiskey—and it would be dangerous for an IC man to\nride in on him. As for Crit, his asperity wore down a little as the\ndays of absence lengthened away; he retracted several statements which\nhe had made to the effect that he hoped the blankety-blank was dead,\nand when one of Boone Morgan's deputies finally rode in to investigate\nthe rumor he told him he was afraid the poor fellow had wandered out\nacross the desert and perished of hunger and thirst.\n\nBill Todhunter was Boone Morgan's regular mountain deputy—sent out to\nlook into all such affairs as this, and incidentally to get evidence\nwhich would come handy in the big tax-collecting that was being planned\nfor the fall. He asked a few questions, whistled through his teeth\nand pondered the matter for a while, meanwhile scrutinizing the hard\ncountenance of his informant with the speculative cynicism of his\nprofession. This was not the first sad case that he had looked into\nwhere a man who was not really needed in the community had mysteriously\ndisappeared, and in one desert tragedy which he had in mind the corpse\nhad assayed more than a trace of lead.\n\n\"Did this man Dalhart ever fill out that assessor's blank I left for\n'im?\" he inquired, after a long pause, meanwhile squatting down and\ndrawing cattle brands in the dirt.\n\n\"Don't know,\" replied Crit, shortly.\n\n\"Let's see, his brand was a Wine-glass, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Nope—Monkey-wrench.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Sure! I knew they was two new irons in there, but I got 'em\nmixed. The Wine-glass is yourn, ain't it?\"\n\nCrittenden nodded sullenly. It was the particular phase of his\nrelations with Pecos Dalhart which he would rather not discuss with an\nofficer. As for the deputy, he spun the wheel in his spur, whistled\n\"Paloma,\" and looked out toward the east.\n\n\"Has he got any mail here waitin' for 'im?\" he asked, rising slowly\nfrom his heels. \"Well, you better give it to me, then—and a little\ngrub. I've always wanted to take a look at that Lost Dog country,\nanyway.\"\n\nIt was a long trail and the tracks were a month old, but Pecos's had\nbeen the last shod horse to travel it and what few cattle there were\nin the country had not been able to obscure the shoe-marks. Following\nthose ancient signs Bill Todhunter worked his way gradually into what\nhad been up to that time, No Man's Land, not forgetting to count the\nWine-glass cattle as he passed the water holes. Not so many years\nbefore the Apaches had held full sway over all the Tonto and Verde\ncountry and when the first settlers came in they had naturally located\nalong the rivers, leaving the barren mountains to the last. It was\na long way from nowhere, that mysterious little Lost Dog Cañon, and\nwhen the deputy rode into it looking for a man whose trail was a month\nold he felt the sobering influence of its funereal cliffs. Black and\nforbidding, they bent bodingly over the tiny valley with its grove\nof cottonwoods and wild walnuts, and upon the western rim a squalid\ngroup of buzzards dozed as if they had made a feast. At the edge of\nthe stream Todhunter reined in his horse, but though his flanks were\ngaunted the animal would not drink. Instead he raised his head and\nsnuffed the air, curiously. It looked ominous, for they were at the\nend of the trail and the tracks still pointed in. The deputy spurred\nnervously across the stream, still with his eye out for signs, and\nfetched up with a jerk. There, fresh and clean in the moist sand, were\nthe imprints of a man's boots, coming down to the water—and not once or\ntwice, but a dozen times.\n\n\"Ahem,\" coughed Todhunter, turning into the path, \"stan' up hyar,\nbronc—what's the matter with you!\" He jerked his unoffending horse out\nof the trail and clattered him over the rocks, for your true officer\ndoes not crowd in with drawn pistol on a man he cannot see. The deputy\nwas strictly a man of peace—and he tried to look the part. His badge\nwas pinned carefully to the inside flap of his vest and if he had a gun\nanywhere it did not show. He swung his quirt in one hand, idly slapping\nit against his chaps, and then, having offered every sign that he came\nopenly and as a friend, he rode cautiously up to the camp.\n\nThere was a fire smouldering upon a stone-walled mound at the entrance\nto the cave and beside it, reclining in a rustic chair, sat Pecos\nDalhart—watchful, silent, alert. In one hand he held a cigarette and\nthe other supported a grimy newspaper which he had been reading. Behind\nhim on tall poles were boxes filled with food, protected by tin cans,\nmushroomed out around the posts to keep the rats from climbing. His\nsaddle was hung up carefully on a rack and his carbine leaned against\nthe chair where he was sitting, but though he had seen no one for a\nmonth Pecos barely glanced up from his paper as the stranger drew near.\n\n\"How'd do,\" observed the deputy, sitting at ease in his saddle.\n\n\"Howdy,\" Pecos grunted, and languidly touching his dead cigarette to\na coal he proceeded with his reading. Todhunter looked his camp over\ncritically, took note of the amount of food stored in the rat-proof\nboxes and of the ingenious workmanship on the rustic chair; then his\neyes wandered back and fixed themselves on Pecos. Instead of the\nroistering boy he had expected he beheld a full-grown man with a\nmonth's growth of curly beard and his jaw set like a steel-trap, as\nif, after all, he was not unprepared for trouble. His hat, however,\nwas shoved back carelessly on his bushy head, his legs crossed, and\nhis pose was that of elegant and luxurious ease. To the left arm of\nhis chair he had attached a horse's hoof, bottom up, in the frog of\nwhich he laid his cigarettes; to the right was fastened a little box\nfilled with tobacco and brown papers, and the fire, smouldering upon\nits altar, was just close enough to provide a light. Evidently the\nlone inhabitant of the cañon had made every endeavor to be comfortable\nand was not above doing a little play-acting to convey the idea of\nunconcern, but the deputy sheriff did not fail to notice the carbine,\nclose at hand, and the pistol by his side. It seemed to him also that\nwhile his man was apparently deeply immersed in his month-old paper,\nhis eyes, staring and intent, looked past it and watched his every\nmove. The conversation having ceased, then, and his curiosity having\nbeen satisfied, Bill Todhunter leaned slowly back to his saddle bags\nand began to untie a package.\n\n\"Are you Mr. Dalhart?\" he inquired, as the cowboy met his eye.\n\n\"That's my name,\" replied Pecos, stiffly.\n\n\"Well, I've got s'm' papers for you,\" observed the deputy,\nenigmatically, and if he had been in two minds as to the way Pecos\nwould take this statement his doubts were instantly set at rest. At the\nword \"papers\"—the same being used for \"warrants\" by most officers of\nthe law—the cowboy rose up in his chair and laid one hand on the butt\nof his revolver.\n\n\"Not for me!\" he said, a cold, steely-blue look comin' into his eyes.\n\"It'll take a better man than you to serve 'em!\"\n\n\"These are newspapers,\" corrected the deputy, quietly. \"Yore friends\ndown on the Verde, not havin' seen you for some time, asked me to take\nout yore mail and see if you was all right.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" grunted Pecos, suspiciously.\n\n\"And, bein' as you seem to be all O. K.,\" continued Todhunter,\npacifically, \"I'll jest turn 'em over to you and be on my way.\" He\nthrew the bundle at his feet, wheeled his horse and without another\nword rode soberly down the trail.\n\n\"Hey!\" shouted Pecos, as the stranger plunged through the creek, but if\nTodhunter heard him he made no sign. There are some people who never\nknow when to go, but Bill Todhunter was not that kind.\n\n\"No, you bet that feller ain't dead,\" he observed, when Crittenden and\nthe chance residents of Verde Crossing gathered about him to hear the\nnews. \"He's sure up an' comin', and on the prod bigger 'n a wolf. I\nwouldn't like to say whether he's quite right in the head or not but I\nreckon it'll pay to humor 'im a little. He'll be down here for grub in\nabout another week, too.\"\n\nThe week passed, but not without its happenings to Verde Crossing. The\nfirst event was the return of Angevine Thorne from Geronimo, after a\nprolonged stay in the city Bastile. Crit sent the bail money down by\nTodhunter immediately upon hearing the news that Pecos Dalhart was\nalive and on the prod. The only man on the Verde who had any influence\nwith Pecos was his old \"cumrad,\" Babe, and Crittenden was anxious to\nget that genial soul back before Pecos came in for supplies. But the\nsame buckboard that brought the Champion of Arizona back to his old\nhaunts took his little friend Marcelina away, and the only reason the\nSeñora would give was that her daughter was going to school. In vain\nBabe palavered her in Spanish and cross-questioned the stolid José. The\nfear of her lawless wooer was upon them—for were they not in debt to\nCrit—and not even by indirection would the fiery Señora give vent to\nthe rage which burned in her heart.\n\n\"This is not a good place for my daughter,\" she said, her eyes\ncarefully fixed upon the ground. \"It is better that she should go to\nthe Sisters' school and learn her catechism.\" So Marcelina was sent\naway from the evil men of Verde, for she was already a woman; but in\nthe haste of packing she managed to snatch just one of the forbidden\nblue handkerchiefs, branded M.\n\nIt was a sombre welcome which awaited the lone rustler of Lost Dog\nCañon when, driven perforce to town, he led his pack-horse up to the\nstore. For a minute he sat in his saddle, silent and watchful; then,\nthrowing his bridle-reins on the ground, he stalked defiantly through\nthe door. A couple of IC cowboys were sitting at the card-table in the\ncorner, playing a three-handed game of poker with Angy, and at sight of\nhim they measured the distance to the door with their eyes.\n\n\"W'y, hello there, Pecos!\" cried Angy, kicking over the table in his\nhaste to grasp him by the hand. \"Where you been all the time—we thought\nfor a time here you was dead!\"\n\n\"Might as well 'a been,\" said Pecos, gruffly, \"for all anybody _give_ a\ndam'!\"\n\n\"Why? What was the matter? Did you git lost?\"\n\n\"I lay out on the mesa for two days,\" answered the cowboy, briefly,\n\"and about a month afterwards a feller come out to my camp to see\nif I was dead. This is a hell of an outfit,\" he observed, glancing\nmalevolently at the IC cowboys, \"and by the way,\" he added, \"where was\n_you_ all the time, Angy?\"\n\nAngevine Thorne's lips trembled at this veiled accusation and he\nstretched out his hands pleadingly. \"I swear, Pardner,\" he protested,\n\"I never heard a word about it until last Saturday! I was in the\nGeronimo jail.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pecos, and without more words he gave him his own right\nhand. The cowboys, who had been uneasy witnesses of the scene, seized\nupon this as a favorable opportunity to make their escape, leaving the\ntwo of them to talk it out together.\n\n\"What in the world happened to us, Angy?\" demanded Pecos in a hushed\nvoice, when the effusion of reconciliation had passed, \"did Crit put\ngun-powder in our whiskey or was it a case of stuffed club? I was plumb\nparalyzed, locoed, and cross-eyed for a week—and my head ain't been\nright since!\" He brushed his hand past his face and made a motion as of\ncatching little devils out of the air, but Angy stayed his arm.\n\n\"Nothin' like that, Pecos,\" he pleaded, hoarsely, \"I'm on the ragged\nedge of the jim-jams myself, and if I get to thinkin' of crawly things\nI'll sure get 'em! No, it was jest that accursed liquor! I don't know\nwhat happened—I remember Crit takin' me down to Geronimo and givin'\nme five dollars and then it was all a dream until I found myself in\nthe jag-cell. But it's the liquor that does it, Pecos—that and the\ncapitalistic classes and the officers of the law. They's no hope for\nthe common people as long as they keep on drinkin'—there's always some\nfeller like Crit to skin 'em, and the constables to run 'em in. It's a\nconspiracy, I tell you; they're banded together to drug and rob us—but,\nPardner, there is one man who is going to balk the cowardly curs.\nNever, never, never, will I let another drop of liquor pass my lips!\"\nHe raised his hand to heaven as he swore the familiar oath, hoping and\nyet not hoping that some power would come down to him to help him fight\nhis fate. \"Will you join me, Cumrad?\" he asked, laying hold of Pecos's\nshoulder. \"You will? Well, let's shake on it—here's to the revolution!\"\n\nThey shook, and turned instinctively toward the bar, but such a pledge\ncannot be cemented in the usual manner, so Angy led the way outside and\nsought a seat in the shade.\n\n\"Where's my little friend Marcelina?\" inquired Pecos, after a long look\nat the white adobe with the brush _ramada_ which housed the Garcia\nfamily, \"hidin' behind a straw somewhere?\"\n\n\"Gone!\" said Angy, solemnly. \"Gone, I know not where.\"\n\n\"What—you don't mean to say—\" cried Pecos, starting up.\n\n\"Her mother sent her down to Geronimo the day that I came up,\"\ncontinued Babe, winking fast. \"It looks as if she fears my influence,\nbut she will not say. Poor little Marcelina—how I miss her!\" He wiped\nhis eyes with the back of his hand and shook his head sadly. \"Verde\nain't been the same to me since then,\" he said, \"an' life ain't worth\nlivin'. W'y, Pecos, if I thought we done something we oughten to when\nwe was drunk that time I'd go out and cut my throat—but the Señora is\npowerful mad. Kin you recollect what went on?\"\n\nA vision of himself trying to barter his mail-order package for a kiss\nflashed up before Pecos in lines of fire, but he shut his lips and\nsat silent. The exaltation and shame of that moment came back to him\nin a mighty pang of sorrow and he bowed his head on his arms. What\nif, in the fury of drink and passion, he had offered some insult to\nhis Señorita—the girl who had crept unbeknown into his rough life and\nfilled it with her smile! No further memory of that black night was\nseared into his clouded brain—the vision ended with the presentation\nof the package. What followed was confined only to the limitations of\nman's brutal whims. For a minute Pecos contemplated this wreck of all\nhis hopes—then, from the abyss of his despair there rose a voice that\ncried for revenge. Revenge for his muddled brain, for the passion\nwhich came with drink: revenge for his girl, whom he had lost by some\nfoolish drunken freak! He leapt to his feet in a fury.\n\n\"It's that dastard, Crit!\" he cried, shaking his fists in the air. \"He\nsold us his cussed whiskey—he sent us on our way! And now I'm goin' to\ngit him!\"\n\nAngy gazed up at him questioningly and then raised a restraining hand.\n\n\"It's more than him, Cumrad,\" he said solemnly. \"More than him! If\nCrit should die to-morrow the system would raise up another robber to\ntake his place. It's the System, Pecos, the System—this here awful\nconspiracy of the capitalistic classes and the servile officers of the\nlaw—that keeps the poor man down. Worse, aye, worse than the Demon\nRum, is the machinations which puts the power of government into the\nmonopolistic hands of capital and bids the workingman earn his bread\nby the sweat of his brow. There is only one answer to the crime of\ngovernment—the revolution!\"\n\n\"Well, let 'er go then,\" cried Pecos, impulsively. \"The revolution she\nis until the last card falls—but all the same I got my eye on Crit!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nDEATH AND TAXES\n\n\nThe iron hand of the law after hovering long above the Verde at last\ndescended suddenly and with crushing force upon the unsuspecting\ncowmen. For a year Boone Morgan had been dallying around, even as other\nsheriffs had done before him, and the first fears of the wary mountain\nmen had speedily been lulled into a feeling of false security. Then the\nfall round-ups came on and in the general scramble of that predatory\nperiod Morgan managed to scatter a posse of newly appointed deputies,\ndisguised as cowboys, throughout the upper range. They returned and\nreported the tally at every branding and the next week every cowman\non the Verde received notice that his taxes on so many head of\ncattle, corral count, were due and more than due. They were due for\nseveral years back but Mr. Boone Morgan, as deputy assessor, deputy\ntax-collector, and so forth, would give them a receipt in full upon the\npayment of the fiscal demand. This would have sounded technical in the\nmouth of an ordinary tax-collector but coming from a large, iron-gray\ngentleman with a six-shooter that had been through the war, it went.\nUpton paid; Crittenden paid; they all paid—all except Pecos Dalhart.\n\nIt was at the store, shortly after he had put the thumb-screws on Ike\nCrittenden and extracted the last ultimate cent, that Boone Morgan\ntackled Pecos for his taxes. He had received a vivid word-picture of\nthe lone resident of Lost Dog from his deputy, Bill Todhunter, and\nPecos had been equally fortified against surprise by Angevine Thorne.\nThey came face to face as Pecos was running over the scare-heads of the\n_Voice of Reason_, and the hardy citizens of Verde Crossing held their\nbreaths and listened for thunder, for Pecos had stated publicly that\nhe did not mean to pay.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Dalhart, I believe,\" began the sheriff in that suave and\ngenial manner which most elected officials have at their command. \"Glad\nto meet you, Mr. Dalhart. There's a little matter of business I'd like\nto discuss, if you'll jest step outside a moment. Yes, thank you.\nNice weather we're having now—how's the feed up on your range? That's\ngood—that's fine. Now, Mr. Dalhart, I don't suppose you get your mail\nvery regular, and mebby you ain't much of a correspondent anyway, but\nmy name's Morgan—I'm a deputy tax-collector right now—and I'd like to\nhave you fill out this blank, giving the number of assessable cattle\nyou have. Sent you one or two by mail, but this is jest as good. Sorry,\nyou understand, but the county needs the money.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sorry, too,\" observed Pecos, sardonically, \"because it'll\nnever git none from me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dunno,\" replied the sheriff, sizing his man up carefully,\n\"Geronimo County has been able to take care of itself, so far; and when\nI put the matter in its proper light to men who have been a little\nlax in the past—men like Upton and Mr. Crittenden, for instance—they\nseem perfectly willing to pay. These taxes are to support the county\ngovernment, you understand—to build roads and keep up the schools and\nall that sort of thing—and every property-owner ought to be glad to do\nhis share. Now about how many head of cows have you got up at Lost Dog\nCañon?\"\n\n\"I've got jest about enough to keep me in meat,\" answered Pecos,\nevasively.\n\n\"Um, that'd be about two hundred head, wouldn't it?\"\n\nTwo hundred was a close guess, and this unexpected familiarity with\nhis affairs startled the cowboy, but his face, nevertheless, did not\nlose its defiant stare. Two hundred was really the difference between\nwhat U cows Upton had lost last spring and the total of Crittenden's\nWine-glass bunch, and Boone Morgan was deeply interested in the\nwhereabouts of that particular two hundred head. To Old Crit, this\ntax-collecting was only a mean raid on his pocket-book—to Morgan it was\nthe first step in his campaign against cattle rustling. When he had\ndetermined the number of head in every brand he might be able to prove\na theft—but not till then.\n\n\"Call it two hundred,\" he suggested, holding out the paper\nencouragingly, but Pecos drew back his hand scornfully.\n\n\"Not if it was a cow and calf,\" he said, \"I wouldn't pay a cent. D'ye\nthink I want to pay a government of robbers? What does yore dam'\ngovernment do for me, or any other pore man, but make us trouble?\"\n\n\"Well, sometimes that's all a government can do for a certain class of\npeople,\" observed the sheriff, eying him coldly, \"and I'd like to say\nright now, Mr. Dalhart, that in such a case it can make a hell of a lot\nof trouble.\"\n\nPecos grunted.\n\n\"Now, jest for instance,\" continued Morgan, warming up a little, \"in\ncase you don't pay your taxes on them two hundred head of cattle I can\nget judgment against you, seize any or all of 'em, and sell the whole\nshooting-match for taxes. I'll do it, too,\" he added.\n\n\"Well, turn yoreself loose, then,\" flared back Pecos, \"the bars are\ndown. But I'll tell you right now, the first deputy tax-collector\nthat puts a rope on one of my cows, I'll bounce a rock off'n him—or\nsomething worse!\"\n\n\"I ain't accustomed to take no threats, Mr. Dalhart,\" bellowed Boone\nMorgan, his temper getting away with him, \"and especially from a\nman in your line of business! Now you go your way, and go as far\nas you please, but if I don't put the fear of God into your black,\ncattle-rustling heart my name is 'Sic 'em' and I'm a dog. I'll collect\nthem taxes, sir, _next week_!\"\n\n\"Like hell you will,\" snarled Pecos, throwing out his chin. He scowled\nback at the irate officer, cast a baleful glance at the IC punchers,\nand mounted from the far side of his horse, but when he rode away Ike\nCrittenden went out behind the corral and laughed until he choked.\nAfter all the trouble this man Dalhart had made him, just to think of\nhim locking horns with Boone Morgan! And all from his crazy reading of\nthe _Voice of Reason_! The memory of his own enforced tax-paying fell\naway from him like a dream at the thought of Pecos Dalhart putting up a\nfight against the sheriff of Geronimo County, and on the strength of it\nhe took a couple of drinks and was good-natured for a week.\n\nIf Pecos had had some self-appointed critic to point out just how\nfoolish he was he might have seen a new light, gathered up about twenty\nhead of Monkey-wrench steers and sold them to pay his taxes; but his\nonly recourse in this extremity was to the _Voice of Reason_, and\nwhatever its other good qualities are, that journal has never been\naccused of preaching moderation and reason. It was war to the knife\nwith Pecos, from the jump, and the day after his return he took his\ncarbine, his cigarette makings, and the last _Voice of Reason_ and\nwent up the trail to lie in wait for Boone Morgan. The country around\nLost Dog Cañon is mostly set on edge and the entrance to the valley is\nthrough a narrow and crooked ravine, filled with bowlders and faced\nwith sun-blackened sandstone rocks, many of which, from some fracture\nof their weathered surface, are pock-marked with giant \"wind-holes.\"\nInto one of these natural pockets, from the shelter of which a single\nman could stand off a regiment, Pecos hoisted himself with the dawn,\nand he did not leave it again till dark. As the wind came up and,\nsucking in through the opening, hollowed out each day its little more,\nthe loose sand from the soft walls blew into Pecos's eyes and he gave\nup his fervid reading; but except for that and for the times when\nfrom the blackness of his cavern he searched the narrow trail for his\nenemies, he pored over the _Voice of Reason_ as a Christian martyr\nmight brood over his Bible. It was his religion, linked with that far\nmore ancient religion of revenge, and if Boone Morgan or any other\ndeputy tax collector had broken in upon his reveries they certainly\nwould have stopped something worse than a bouncing stone.\n\nBut no one played into his hand to that extent. They say the Apaches\neducated the whole United States army in the art of modern warfare and\nBoone Morgan as a frontier Indian fighter had been there to learn his\npart. In the days when Cochise and Geronimo were loose he had travelled\nbehind Indian scouts over all kinds of country, and one of the first\nthings he had mastered was the value of high ground. He had learned\nalso that one man in the rocks is worth a troop on the trail and while\nhe was gathering up a posse to discipline Pecos Dalhart he sent Bill\nTodhunter ahead to prospect. For two long days that wary deputy haunted\nthe rim-rock that shut in Lost Dog Cañon, crawling on his belly like\na snake, and at last, just at sundown, his patience was rewarded by\nthe sight of the lost Pecos, carbine in hand, rising up from nowhere\nand returning to his camp. As the smoke rose from his newly lighted\nfire Todhunter slipped quietly down the ravine and, stepping from rock\nto rock, followed the well-trampled trail till he came to the mouth\nof the wind-cave. Peering cautiously in he caught the odor of stale\ntobacco smoke and saw the litter of old papers on the sandy floor,\nsigns enough that Pecos lived there—then, as the strategy and purpose\nof the cattle-rustler became plain, he picked his way back to his\nlonely camp and waited for another day. With the dawn he was up again\nand watching, and when he saw Pecos come back and hide himself in his\nwind-cave he straightened up and set about his second quest—the search\nfor the Monkey-wrench cattle. At the time of his first visit to Lost\nDog he had seen a few along the creek but there must be more of them\ndown the cañon, and the farther away they could be found the better\nit would suit his chief. It was not Boone Morgan's purpose to start a\nwar—all he wanted was enough Monkey-wrench cattle to pay the taxes,\nand a way to get them out. The indications so far were that Pecos had\nthem in a bottle and was waiting at the neck, but if the water ran\ndown the cañon there must be a hole somewhere, reasoned the deputy, or\nbetter than that, a trail. Working his way along the rim Bill Todhunter\nfinally spied the drift-fence across the box of the cañon, and soon\nfrom his high perch he was gazing down into that stupendous hole in\nthe ground that Pecos had turned into a pasture. From the height of\nthe towering cliffs the cattle seemed like rabbits feeding in tiny\nspots of green, but there they were, more than a hundred of them, and\nwhen the deputy beheld the sparkling waters of the Salagua below them\nand the familiar pinnacles of the Superstitions beyond he laughed and\nfell to whistling \"Paloma\" through his teeth. Boone Morgan had hunted\nApaches in the Superstitions, and he knew them like a book. With one\nman on the rim-rocks to keep tab on Pecos, Boone and his posse could\ntake their time to it, if there was any way to get in from that farther\nside. Anyhow, he had located the cattle—the next thing was to get word\nto the Old Man.\n\nAs a government scout Boone Morgan had proved that he was fearless,\nbut they did not keep him for that—they kept him because he brought\nhis men back to camp, every time. The effrontery of Pecos Dalhart's\ndaring to challenge his authority had stirred his choler, but when\nBill Todhunter met him at the river and told him how the ground lay he\npassed up the temptation to pot Pecos as he crawled out of his hole in\nthe rock, and rode for the lower crossing of the Salagua. The trail\nwhich the hardy revolutionist of Lost Dog Cañon was guarding was,\nindeed, the only one on the north side of the river. From the pasture\nwhere his cows were hidden the Salagua passed down a box cañon so deep\nand precipitous that the mountain sheep could not climb it, and even\nwith his cowboy-deputies Boone Morgan could hardly hope to run the\nMonkey-wrench cows out over the peaks without drawing the fire of their\nowner. But there was a trail—and it was a bad one—that led across the\ndesert from the Salagua until it cut the old Pinal trail, far to the\nsouth, and that historic highway had led many a war party of Apaches\nthrough the very heart of the Superstitions. East it ran, under the\nfrowning bastions of the great mountain, and then northeast until it\ncame out just across the river from Pecos Dalhart's pasture. It was a\nlong ride—sixty miles, and half of it over the desert—but the river was\nat its lowest water, just previous to the winter rains, and once there\nBoone Morgan felt certain they could make out to cross the cattle.\n\n\"And mind you, boys,\" he said to his posse, as they toiled up the\nwearisome grade, \"don't you leave a single cow in that pasture or I'm\ngoing to be sore as a goat. The county pays mileage for this, and the\ntaxes will be a few cents, too—but I'm going to put one rustler out of\nbusiness at the start by a hell-roaring big sheriff's sale. I'm going\nto show some of these Texas hold-ups that Arizona ain't no cow-thief's\nparadise—not while old Boone's on the job.\"\n\nThe second night saw them camped on the edge of the river just across\nfrom the pasture, and in the morning they crossed on a riffle, every\nman with his orders for the raid. By noon the cattle began to come\ndown the valley, tail up and running before the drive; not a word was\nspoken, for each man knew his business, but when the thirsty herd of\nMonkey-wrench cows finally waded out into the river to drink, a sudden\nrush of horsemen from behind crowded the point animals into swimming\nwater, and before the leaders knew what had happened they were half way\nacross the river and looking for a landing.\n\n\"_Ho—ho—ho—ho—ho!_\" shouted the sheriff, riding in to turn them\nupstream, and behind him a chorus of cowboy yells urged the last\nbewildered stragglers into the current. They crossed, cows and calves\nalike, and while the jubilant posse came splashing after them or rode\nhowling up to the ford Boone Morgan poured the water out of his boots\nand smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"Jest hold 'em in the willows a while, boys,\" he said, \"until they git\nquieted down and drink, and then we'll hit the trail. There's over a\nhundred head of cattle there, but I'm going to sell every dam' one\nof 'em—sheriff's sale. Then when that crazy Texican gets back on the\nreservation I'll give him back his money—what's left—along with some\ngood advice.\"\n\nHe motioned to the boys to string the cattle out and soon in a long\nline the much-stolen Monkey-wrench cows were shambling over the rough\ntrail, lowing and bellowing for the peaceful valley that lay empty of\nits herd. From the high cliffs above Lost Dog Cañon, Bill Todhunter\nsaw the slow procession wending its way toward town and he made haste\nto follow its example. The old silence settled down upon the valley\nof Perro Perdito, a silence unbroken even by the lowing of cattle,\nand as Pecos lay by his fire that night he felt the subtle change.\nHis mind, so long set against his enemies, opened up, and he began to\nwonder. Boone Morgan had certainly said he would collect those taxes\nwithin a week, and the week was up. Moreover, hiding in a wind-hole\nfrom daylight till dark was getting decidedly monotonous. From the\nbeginning Pecos had realized that he was one man against many but he\nhad hoped, by remaining hid, to catch them at a disadvantage. If they\nsneaked up and looked over into the lonely cañon they might easily\nthink he had fled and come in boldly—but somehow nothing came out as he\nhad expected. He slept on the matter, and woke again to that peculiar\nhushed silence. What was it that he missed? His horses were safe in\ntheir pole corral; Old Funny-face and her speckled calf were still\nhanging around the camp; the cattle were along the creek as usual—ah,\nyes! It was the lowing of cows against the drift-fence bars! With a\nvigorous kick he hurled his blanket aside, stamped on his boots and\nran, only stopping to buckle on his six-shooter. At the bars he paused\nlong enough to see that there were no fresh tracks and then dashed down\nthe pent-in gorge that led to the pasture rim. The shadow of the high\ncliffs lay across the sunken valley like a pall, but there were no\nhumped-up cattle sleeping beneath the trees. It was time for them to be\nout and feeding in the sun, but the meadows and hillsides were bare.\nHe was astounded and could not believe his eyes—the pasture was empty\nas the desert. Cursing and panting Pecos plunged madly down the steep\ntrail until he came to the first water, and there he threw down his\ngun and swore. Fresh and clean on the margin of the water-hole was the\ntrack of a shod horse, pointing toward the river! It was enough—Pecos\nknew that he was cleaned! Indians and mountain renegades do not ride\nshod horses, and if Boone Morgan had his cows across the river already\nhe could never get them back. Another thought came to Pecos, and he\nscrambled wildly up the trail to defend his remaining herd, but there\nwas no one there to fight him—his upper cattle were safe. Yet how long\nwould it take to get them, in order to finish him up? All Boone Morgan\nand Upton had to do was to wait until he went down to the store for\nprovisions and then they could rake his upper range the same way. And\nwould they do it? Well, say! Pecos pondered on the matter for a day or\ntwo, keeping mostly behind the shelter of some rock, and the sinister\nimport of Morgan's remarks on what a government can do for a certain\nclass of people bore in upon him heavily. Undoubtedly he was included\nin that class of undesirables and if he was any reader of character\nBoone Morgan was just the kind of a man to make him a lot of trouble.\nUpton was against him because he had stolen his U cows, and Crit was\nagainst him worse because he had given him the cross—every cowman on\nthe range would be against him because he was a rustler. Pecos watched\nthe rim-rock vindictively after that, hoping to get a chance to pot\nsome meddlesome cowman, but no inquisitive head was poked over. At\nlast he stole up the ravine one morning and took to the high ground at\ndawn. There, sure enough, were the boot-marks among the rocks and he\nnoticed with a vague uneasiness that some one had been watching him\nfor days—watching his wind-hole, too,—probably could have shot him a\nhundred times, but now the tracks were old. A hot and unreasonable\nresentment rose up in Pecos at the implication. Nobody cared for him\nnow, even to the extent of watching him! He could crawl into his hole\nand die now, and everybody would just laugh. Well, he would show Mr.\nEverybody what kind of a sport he was. After which circumlocuted\nreasoning Pecos Dalhart, the bad man from Perro Perdito Cañon, being\nreally lonely as a dog, threw the saddle on his horse and hit the trail\nfor the Verde.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSTAMPEDED\n\n\nFor two weeks after Pecos Dalhart disappeared into the wilderness\nAngevine Thorne spent the greater part of his time sitting in the\ndoorway of the store with his eyes fixed upon the tiny notch where\nthe Carrizo trail cut down through the mesa's rim. Never, until that\nday when he had defied Boone Morgan, had Angy realized the heroic\ndevotion of his comrade to the cause of the revolution, and his heart\nwas strong to help him, even at the risk of his job. If Crit would\nonly have let him have a horse he would have gone to Lost Dog Cañon\nlong ago, to carry the news of Morgan's raid and his subsequent visit\nto Verde Crossing in search of Pecos, but lacking any means of travel\nhe had to be content to wait and watch the trail. The two weeks passed\ndrearily and still, as each afternoon wore on, Babe seated himself in\nthe shade of the brush _ramada_ and speculated upon the fate of Pecos.\nBut in this he was not alone. Early in the game Isaac Crittenden had\nnoted the set gaze of his faithless roustabout, and though he still\nrode out with his cowboys, he also managed to keep his one eye cocked\non the eastern horizon, for he had interests in those parts. There were\na hundred head of Monkey-wrench cattle still running loose in Lost Dog\nCañon, and that would make good pickings if Pecos went over the road.\nAs to what particular road the cattle-rustler took, whether to the\npen or parts unknown, or to his home on high, was immaterial to Isaac\nCrittenden, providing always that he heard about it first. A bunch of\nmavericks without an owner was likely to get snapped up quick in those\nparts—John Upton might turn out to be the lucky man, but not if I. C.\nknew himself, and he thought he did.\n\nIt is a long day's ride from Lost Dog Cañon—dragging a pack-animal a\nman would get in about sundown—and as the days wore on Crittenden made\nit a point to ride so that he could cut the Carrizo trail between four\nand five. This was a desperate game that he was playing, for Pecos\nDalhart was undoubtedly in an ugly mood; but a little nerve will carry\na man a long way sometimes, and at a pinch Crit could shoot a gun\nhimself. So it happened that on the day that Pecos rode to the edge\nof the bench and sat looking down doubtfully upon the distant Verde\nCrossing, he heard a horse pounding in on his right and finally made\nout Isaac Crittenden, in wild and unnecessary pursuit of a cow. At a\nsuitable distance the cowman looked up, let his cow go, and ambled\ncautiously over toward his former agent. Holding his hands in sight to\nshow that his intentions were pacific, he came in closer and at last\nmotioned to Pecos to come away from the mesa rim.\n\n\"What's the matter with you?\" he called, frantically repeating his\nsignal. \"D' you want to let Boone Morgan see you?\"\n\n\"Boone Morgan?\" repeated Pecos, reining in his horse. \"Why—what—\"\n\n\"Haven't you heard the news?\" demanded Crittenden, hectoringly. \"Boone\nMorgan took a hundred head of your Monkey-wrench critters down the\nPinal trail, and every dam' one of 'em had been burnt over from a U. He\nwas up here inquirin' for you a day or two ago.\"\n\nTheir eyes met and Pecos tried to pass it off in bravado, but Crit\nhad him at a disadvantage. \"The best thing you can do is drift,\" he\nobserved, meaningly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Pecos, \"I got a hundred head an' more of cows\nover in Lost Dog Cañon yet. What'll you—\"\n\n\"They ain't worth a dam',\" cut in Crittenden, harshly.\n\n\"No, I know they ain't,\" assented the cowboy, patiently, \"not to me—but\nto a man with a big outfit they'd be worth about fifteen hundred\ndollars.\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ don't want 'em,\" snapped Crit. \"I got troubles enough,\nalready, without hidin' out from Boone Morgan.\"\n\n\"I'll sell you that brand cheap,\" supplicated Pecos, but the cowman\nonly showed his teeth in derision.\n\n\"Wouldn't take 'em as a gift,\" he said, shortly.\n\n\"Well, go to hell, then!\" snarled the rustler, and jerking his horse\naround he started toward Verde Crossing.\n\n\"Hey, where you goin'?\" called Crittenden, but Pecos did not reply.\n\"You'll git into trouble,\" he persisted, following anxiously after him.\n\"Say, do you want to break into jail?\"\n\nPecos halted on the rim of the mesa, turned deliberately about and\nfaced him.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"do you?\"\n\n\"Why, what d' you mean?\" demanded the cowman, leaving off his\nblustering and coming nearer.\n\n\"Well, if they throw me in I'll tell all I know,\" replied Pecos.\n\"That's all. They may soak me for the Monkey-wrenches, but I'll sure\ngit you on them Wine-glasses, so you better not try any funny business.\nWhat I'm lookin' for now is travellin' expenses—I'm not so stuck on\nthis country that I couldn't be induced to leave it!\"\n\n\"No-o,\" sneered the cowman, \"I don't reckon you are. They ain't a man\nbetween Tonto and the Gila that don't know you for a rustler now. More\n'n that, you've defied the officers of the law. No, Mr. Dalhart,\" he\nsaid, a cold glint coming into his eye, \"I won't give you a dam' cent\nfor your burnt-over cattle and if you take my advice you'll hit the\nhigh places for New Mexico.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't take it, then,\" replied Pecos, sullenly. \"I'm goin' down\nto the Crossing to see Angy and—hey! there's the old boy now, flaggin'\nme from the store. Well, good-bye, old Cock Eye, don't worry about me\nnone, I know my way around!\" He favored his former employer with a\nflaunting gesture of farewell, leaned over to catch the forward jump\nof his horse, and went scampering down the slope and across the level,\nyipping playfully at every bound.\n\n\"Well, the blank-blanked fool!\" exclaimed Crittenden, slapping his leg\nviciously with his quirt at this sudden wrecking of his hopes. \"Well,\n_dam'_ 'im, for a proper eejit!\" He ground his teeth in vexation. \"W'y,\nthe crazy dum-head!\" he groaned, as the cloud of dust receded. \"Boone\nMorgan is shore to come back to the Crossing to-night and catch 'im in\nthe store! Him and that booze-fightin' Angy—I got to git rid of him—but\nwhat in the world am _I_ goin' to do?\"\n\nFrom his station on the edge of the mesa he could see the dust to the\neast where his cowboys were bringing the day's beef-cut down to the\nriver and then, far up toward the northern pass, a couple of horsemen\njogging down the Tonto trail. Boone Morgan rode a bay horse, and one\nof these was solid color, but the other rode an animal that showed a\npatch of white—looked kind of familiar, too. He watched them until\nthey showed up clear against a clay-bank and then, making sure that the\nman on the bay was Morgan, he spurred across the flat to the store.\nWhatever happened, he must be sure to get Pecos out of town, for Upton\nhad been talking Wine-glass to Morgan, and they might summon him for a\nwitness.\n\nThere was a sound of clanking glasses inside the door as Crittenden\nrode up, and the voice of Angevine Thorne, flamboyantly proclaiming a\ntoast.\n\n\"Then here's to the revolution,\" he ended up, \"and a pleasant journey\nto you, Cumrad, wherever you go!\"\n\nThey drank, and Crit, sitting outside on his horse, slapped his thigh\nand laughed silently. \"A pleasant journey,\" eh? Well, let it go at that\nand he would put up the whiskey.\n\n\"You'll be sure and write me often,\" continued Angy, caressingly, \"and\nI'll send your _Voice of Reason_ to you, so you can keep up with the\ntimes.\"\n\n\"All right, Pardner,\" answered Pecos, \"but say, give Marcelina my best\nand tell her I'll be back in the spring. Tell 'er something real nice\nfor me, Angy, will you? Aw, to hell with the cows; it'll be her I come\nback for! Gittin' a little too warm for me right now, but I'll be here\nwhen she comes home in the spring. Well, let's take another drink to\nthe sweetest little girl that ever lived and then I'll be on my way!\"\nThe glasses clicked again and as Angy began another peroration Old Crit\npulled his horse around with an oath and started up the road. So that\nwas why he had been turned down by Marcelina—Pecos was making love to\nher while he was gone! And he'd be back in the springtime, eh? Well,\nnot if there was room in the county jail and Boone Morgan would take\nhim down! Hot with his new-made scheme for revenge he spurred his horse\nto a gallop and was just swinging around the first turn in the trail\nwhen he fetched up face to face with Morgan and John Upton!\n\nThe world is full of hatred in a thousand forms but there is none more\nbitter than that between two men who have seen a former friendship\nturn to gall and wormwood. So bitter was the enmity between Upton and\nOld Crit that it needed but the time and occasion to break out into\na war. Short, freckle-faced, and red-headed, with a week's growth of\nstubby beard and a clear green eye, John Upton was not a man that one\nwould pick for an enemy, and the single swift move that he made toward\nhis pistol expressed his general sentiments plainer than any words. As\nfor Crittenden, his emotions were too badly mixed to lead to action,\nbut the one-eyed glare which he conferred upon his cow-stealing rival\nconvinced Boone Morgan at a glance that Old Crit was dangerous.\n\n\"I'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Crittenden,\" he said, taking\ncommand on the instant, \"and since Mr. Upton is interested in this\nmatter I have asked him to come along down. We won't discuss the\nbusiness I have in hand until we get to town, but now that I've got\nyou two gentlemen together I'd like to ask you to be a little more\ncareful about your branding. My deputies reported to me that on the\nlast round-up calves were found bearing a different iron from their\nmothers and that mavericks were branded on sight, anywhere on the open\nrange. The law provides, as you know, that no cow-brute can be branded\nanywhere except in a corral or at a round-up and no man has the right\nto brand any maverick, _orejano_, leppy, or sleeper except in the\npresence and with the consent of witnesses. There have been certain\nirregularities up here in the past, as is to be expected in a new\ncountry, but I want to tell you right now that in the future I'm going\nto hold you cowmen to the law. I was elected and sworn in to uphold\nthe peace and dignity of Geronimo County, so if you have any little\nfeuds or differences to work off, I'll thank you to do it outside my\njurisdiction.\"\n\nHe paused, and as they rode down the broad trail that merged into\nVerde's main street the rival cattle kings exchanged malignant glances\nbehind his broad and soldierly back. But the sheriff's eyes were to the\nfore and at sight of Pecos Dalhart's horse tied to the ground in front\nof the store he chuckled to himself.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, reaching down into his inside vest pocket, \"I'm\njust in time to deliver these papers—or am I mistaken in thinking\nthat that hoss yonder belongs to Mr. Dalhart?\" He glanced across at\nCrittenden, who shrugged his shoulders and scowled. \"Quite correct, eh?\nWell, then, if you gentlemen will excuse me for a moment I'll go in and\nsee Mr. Dalhart.\"\n\nHe swung down from his horse with military precision and strode toward\nthe door, carrying a bulky official envelope in his left hand and a\ncigar stump in his right, but just as he crossed the threshold Pecos\nDalhart, startled by his voice, dodged out the back way and ran around\nthe store. It was a break for liberty with him and he took no thought\nof the cost. Three seconds after the sheriff entered the doorway he\ncame tearing around the corner, heading for his horse. At sight of\nUpton and Old Crit he paused and reached for his gun—for one tense\nmoment they glared at each other—then, flinging himself into the saddle\nand hugging his horse's neck, Pecos went spurring away down the trail,\nreckless of everything but the one main chance of escape.\n\n\"Hey! Wait a minute!\" roared Boone Morgan, dashing out the doorway and\nwaving his envelope. \"Come back heah, you pore dam' fool! Well, don't\nthat beat the devil?\" he inquired, turning to Crit and Upton. \"_I_\ndidn't have no warrant for him! No! I jest wanted—\" he paused and,\nnoticing the wolfish eagerness with which the cowmen awaited his final\nwords, he suddenly changed his mind. \"Well, what's the difference,\"\nhe grumbled, tucking the big envelope back into his pocket, \"he'll\nkeep.\" He followed the cloud of dust that stood for Pecos Dalhart until\nit tore up over the rim of the mesa and disappeared, and a deep and\nsubterranean rumbling in his chest paid tribute to the joke. There was\nsomething like a thousand dollars in that big official envelope—the\nbalance of the Monkey-wrench tax sale—and all he wanted of Pecos was\nhis written receipt for the money.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE CATTLE WAR\n\n\nWhen Pecos Dalhart, flying from his own evil conscience, went\nstampeding out into the wilderness, Isaac Crittenden and John Upton\ngazed after him with but a single thought—who would get his cattle?\nWith Pecos out of the way, Crittenden saw a clear field ahead of him in\nthe Lost Dog country and he joined Morgan in a throaty laugh, but Upton\nviewed his mad flight with disappointment and chagrin.\n\n\"Well, laugh then, you robber,\" he snarled, turning angrily on Crit,\n\"I s'pose it tickles you to death to see that dam' cow-thief hit the\npike—he might talk and git you into trouble. Say, Mr. Morgan,\" he\nprotested, \"ain't you takin' quite a responsibility onto yourself to\nlet that man git away?—you know what we came down here for,\" he added,\njerking his head toward Crit.\n\n\"Well, what did you come down here for, you little sawed-off runt?\"\ndemanded Crittenden, belligerently. \"Hollerin' around, as usual, I\ns'pose!\"\n\n\"I come down here to find out about them U cows of mine that you\nbranded into a Wine-glass,\" retorted Upton, \"but you and the sheriff\nhere seem to have some kind of an understandin', lettin' the principal\nwitness git away, and all that, so I reckon I better pull.\"\n\n\"Not before you eat them words, Mr. Upton,\" cut in the sheriff,\nfiercely. \"I don't let no man make insinuations like that about me\nwithout callin' on him to retract—and I ain't never been disappointed\nyet!\"\n\n\"Well, you jest let that Dalhart feller git away, didn't you?\" demanded\nUpton, defiantly.\n\n\"I certainly did, sir,\" replied Boone Morgan, with ponderous dignity,\n\"and when you git ready to start I shall accord you the same courtesy!\nThere are no papers out for Mr. Dalhart and unless I detect him in some\nbreach of law or receive a warrant for his arrest I've got no right to\nlay a finger on him. Now you know very well I've got no understanding\nwith Crittenden, and I'm goin' to ask you to apologize for that\nstatement you jest made.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't mean no offence,\" protested the cowman, meekly, \"and I\napologize, all right—but at the same time it don't seem right to let\nthat dam' cattle-rustler git away like that.\"\n\n\"No,\" responded the sheriff, with heavy sarcasm, \"it don't. But bein'\nas he's gone you _cowmen_ will have a chance to show what good citizens\n_you_ are. I don't know jest what Mr. Dalhart's plans are, but when\nit comes around to the spring round-up I want to find every one of\nthem Monkey-wrench cattle _thar_! He's paid his taxes in full and\nhe's entitled to the full protection of the law, so long as he keeps\nthe peace. You hear me talking, now; this brand-burnin' has gone far\nenough.\"\n\n\"But how about them U cows I lost?\" put in Upton, pertinently. \"Do Crit\nand this Pecos Dalhart git to keep all the critters they stole?\"\n\n\"Stole, nothin'!\" retorted Crittenden hotly. \"How about them J I C cows\nof yourn?\"\n\n\"You make a business of burnin' my brand!\" rejoined Upton, shaking\nhis finger threateningly. \"You hire men to rob me and rake my whole\nupper range! I'm losin' more now than I did when the Apaches was in\nthe hills; but I'll git even with you yet, you dam', humped-back old\ncow-thief!\"\n\n\"Well, I see you gentlemen are goin' to keep on quarrellin',\" observed\nBoone Morgan, picking up his bridle-rein, \"and I might as well go on\nabout my business. You got no more respect for the law, either one of\nyou, than a common cattle-rustler, and I'm goin' to quit wrastlin' with\nyou, right now. But you can cut this out and paste it in your hats—the\nfirst man that steals a cow in Geronimo County, and I catch 'im, is\ngoin' to git the limit. Angy, gimme a bag of crackers and some of that\njerked beef—I'm tired of hearin' this yawp.\"\n\nSo genuine was his disgust that Boone Morgan plunged through the cold\nriver at nightfall and took the long trail for Geronimo, but the memory\nof his last words lingered in the minds of the warring cowmen for many\na day, and though Pecos Dalhart was known to be over in New Mexico\nsomewhere his Monkey-wrench herd remained safe in Lost Dog Cañon. As\nfor the sheriff, having abandoned all idea of peace, he transacted his\nbusiness in the mountains by deputy and sat quiet in Geronimo, waiting\nonly for the first break to come back and make his word good. It had a\nwonderful restraining influence upon Crit and Upton, this prolonged and\nominous absence, but as spring came on and the new crop of calves began\nto gambol on the mesas, the old spirit of grab rose up and overleapt\nthe dull fear of last winter. Once more both Crit and Upton began to\ntake on nervy cowboys—men who by their boasts or by their silence let\nit be known that they were game—and the cow-camp at Verde Crossing\nsheltered gun-men from all over the Far West. From the Tonto country\nthere came rumors that Upton was bringing in bad men from Pleasant\nValley, fresh from the bloody combats where the Grahams and Tewkesburys\nmet. Bill Todhunter rode in when the round-up was well begun and looked\nthe outfits over with grave unconcern, dropping out of sight on the\ntrail and turning up at Geronimo two days later to report that all was\nwell in Lost Dog Cañon. There were no deputy sheriffs in disguise on\nthis round-up—both Crittenden and Upton satisfied themselves of that\nearly in the day—and as the work went on and the lust for spoils grew\nwith each branded maverick, the war spirit crept in and grew apace.\n\nIke Crittenden was the first to renew the feud—he came across an old\nICU cow and branded her to ICU2. One of Upton's range riders picked her\nup after the branding and Upton promptly altered the brand on an IC\ncow, to break even. Then came the grand _coup_ for which Crittenden\nhad long been preparing. On the morning after Upton took his revenge,\nthe whole IC outfit—forty cowboys and every man armed—went galloping\nover the Carrizo trail to Lost Dog Cañon. By noon they had gathered\nevery animal in the valley; at night they camped with the herd at\nCarrizo Springs; and the next day every Monkey-wrench cow was safe\nin the Verde corrals with her Monkey-wrench burnt to a Spectacle\n([Illustration: [++] Cattle brand in the shape of eyeglasses.]) and her\nears chopped down to her head. The ear-marks having been altered once\nalready there was nothing for it but to make the new marks deeper\nand more inclusive—swallow-fork the left and crop the right. The\nswallow-fork was deep in the left, to take in an underbit that Pecos\nhad cut, and Old Funny-face, who had returned home with the herd, lost\nthe fancy Mexican window and _anzuelo_ in her right ear altogether,\nalong with all other signs of a former ownership. But even then the\nartistic knife-work of José Garcia was not allowed to perish from\nthe earth. As Funny-face rose up from this last indignity and menaced\nthe perspiring cowboys with her horns, the little Garcia children,\nhanging over the fence, dashed out through the dust and turmoil and\nrescued the close-cropped ears. Already, in spite of threats and\nadmonitions, they had gathered quite a collection of variegated crops\nand swallow-forks to serve as play-cows in their toy corral; but when\nMarcelina came upon this last bloody evidence of the despite that was\nshown her lover she snatched the ears away and hid them in the thatched\nroof. Old Funny-face was Pecos's cow—she knew that as well as she knew\nthe red-spotted, dun-colored ears that had adorned her speckled head.\nPecos had bought Funny-face and her calf from her father for thirty\ndollars, to keep around his camp to milk, and now there was nothing to\nshow for his ownership but the ears. But perhaps Pecos would be glad\neven for them, if ever he came back. In a letter to Babe he had said he\nwas coming back, now that the sheriff was his friend. But Crit—ha-ah,\nOl' Creet—he was stealing all of Pecos's cows, and the sheriff did not\ncare! She stood by a post of the brush _ramada_ and scowled at him as\nhe raged about on his horse, cursing and shouting and waving his arms\nand hurrying his men along. He was a bad man—ahr, how she hated him—and\nnow he was such a thief!\n\nAs the quick work of branding was brought to an end and the herd\ndriven pell-mell down the river and into the heavy willows, the Boss\nof Verde Crossing sent half of his cowboys down to guard them and\nbegan to clean up the corral. First he put out the fires and quenched\nthe hot running-irons and rings; then he removed the branding outfit,\ndug a deep hole in the river-bed and set his men to work in details,\ngathering up the clipped ears and swallow-forks from the trampled dirt\nof the corral. A single ear left lying would be a record of his theft,\nand when one of the Garcia _niños_, by an ill-timed dash for more ears,\nset Crit upon the trail of their play cows he rushed in and ravished\nall their toy corrals, even though Marcelina stood by the _ramada_ and\ncurled her lip at his haste.\n\n\"You will rob even the cheeldren, Meester Creet!\" she remarked, as he\ndumped them all into his hat.\n\n\"Mind your own business!\" he answered, sharply, and scuttled away like\na crab, bearing his plunder with him.\n\n\"Ah, you ba-ad man!\" observed Marcelina, making faces at his bent back.\n\"I hope Paycos come back and _keel_ you!\"\n\nBut Isaac Crittenden was not worrying about any such small fry as\nPecos Dalhart. Boone Morgan and John Upton were the men he had on his\nmind and it was about time for Upton to show up. A solitary horseman,\nhigh up on the shoulder of the peaks, had watched their departure from\nCarrizo Springs that morning, and if Upton had not known before he\ncertainly knew very well now that the Monkey-wrench brand was no more.\nAs for Boone Morgan—well, there was an IC cow in the corral, altered\nby John Upton to JIC, and it was just as big a crime to steal one cow\nas it was to steal a hundred. One thing was certain, no man from the\nIC outfit would call on the sheriff for aid; and if Upton was the\nred-headed terror that he claimed to be, the matter would be settled\nout of court.\n\nIn this particular incident Mr. Crittenden was more than right. The\nmatter was already adjudicated by range law, and entirely to the\nsatisfaction of Upton. For while Crit was hustling his Monkey-wrench\nherd over to Verde Crossing, the U outfit—also forty strong—had\nhopped over the shoulder of the Peaks, rounded up every Wine-glass\ncow that they could gather, and were at that moment busily engaged at\nCarrizo Springs in altering them to a Circle-cross ([Illustration:\n[++] Brand in the shape of a female gender symbol]). It made a very\npretty brand too; but after studying on it for a while and recalling\nhis past experience with Crit, Upton decided to play safe and make\nit a double cross ([Illustration: Brand in the shape of circle with\na double cross]). No more ICU2's for John Upton—he had been there\nonce—and Circle Double-cross it went on every animal they marked. The\nnext morning, with every cow and calf well in hand, the U boys began to\ndrift the Circle Double-cross herd back over the mountain, and just as\nCrittenden was marshalling his fighting men to win back the ravished\nstock there was a clatter of hoofs down at the Crossing and Boone\nMorgan rode into camp, followed by a posse of deputies.\n\n\"Well, what's the trouble up here, Mr. Crittenden?\" he inquired,\nglancing with stern displeasure at the armed men who gathered about\ntheir chief. \"Is there an Injun uprisin' or have you gone on the\nwarpath yourse'f?\"\n\n\"You jest come down to my corral,\" spat back Crittenden, \"and I'll show\nyou what's the matter! That low-lived John Upton has been burnin' my\nbrand!\" He led the way at a gallop to where the IC cow that had been\naltered to JIC was tied by the horns to a post. \"You see that brand?\"\nhe inquired, \"well, that was made three days ago by John Upton—you can\nsee the J is still raw.\"\n\n\"Umph!\" grunted the sheriff, after a careful scrutiny of the brand,\n\"did anybody see him do it?\"\n\n\"No, but he done it, all right!\"\n\n\"Would you swear to it? Can you prove it? How do you know somebody else\ndidn't do it?\"\n\n\"No, I can't swear to it—and I can't prove it, neither—but one of my\nboys picked that cow up three days ago right in the track of Upton's\noutfit, and, knowin' the little whelp as I do, I don't need no lawyer's\ntestimony to make a case!\"\n\n\"Well, I do,\" replied Boone Morgan, resolutely, \"and I don't want this\nto go any further until I get the facts! What you goin' to do with all\nthose two-gun cowboys?\"\n\n\"I'm goin' to take over the mesa after John Upton and his dam',\ncow-stealin' outfit,\" cried Crittenden, vehemently, \"and if you're\nlookin' for legal evidence, he went out of Carrizo Springs this\nmornin' drivin' nigh onto two hundred head of Wine-glass cows, as one\nof my boys jest told me. Law, nothin'!\" shouted the cowman, recklessly.\n\"I ain't goin' to sit around here, twiddlin' my fingers, and waitin'\nfor papers and evidence! What I want is action!\"\n\n\"Well, you'll get it, all right,\" replied Morgan, \"and dam' quick, too,\nif you think you can run it over me! I want you to understand, Mr.\nCrittenden, that I am the sheriff of this county, and the first break\nyou make to go after John Upton I'll send you down to Geronimo with the\nnippers on, to answer for resisting an officer! Now as for these men of\nyours, I give every one of 'em notice, here and now, that I want this\nracket to stop, and the first man that goes up against me will wind up\nin the county jail. Bill,\" he continued, turning to his trusted deputy,\n\"I leave you in charge of this layout while I go after John Upton. Keep\nthe whole outfit in camp until I come back, if you have to kill 'em.\nI've got enough of this.\"\n\nHe rode down to the store with his posse, bought a feed of grain for\nhis horses and provisions for his men, and half an hour afterward went\ngalloping out the Carrizo trail, his keen eye scanning the distant\nridges and reading the desert signs like a book. It did not take an\nIndian trailer to interpret the deep-trampled record of that path. Two\ndays before a big herd of cows and calves had come into Verde Crossing\nfrom Carrizo, driven by many shod horses and hustled along in a hurry.\nAs he approached Carrizo fresher tracks cut across the old signs, the\ntracks of cows and calves fleeing from scampering ponies, and at the\nSprings the fresh signs closed in and trampled out all evidence of the\nold drive. It was the last page of the story, written indelibly in\nthe sandy earth. On the open _parada_ ground the cropped ears had all\nbeen gathered, but the bruised bushes, the blood and signs of struggle\ntold the plain story of Upton's branding, just as the vacancy of the\nlandscape and the long trail leading to the north spelled the material\nfacts of the drama. The Wine-glass cows that used to be about Carrizo\nSprings were gone—John Upton had driven them north. But why? The answer\nlay beyond Carrizo Springs, where the white trail leads down from Lost\nDog Cañon. There the trampled tracks that led into Verde Crossing stood\nout plain again in the dust—three days old and pressed on by hurrying\nhorses. If the law could accept the record of Nature's outspread book\nCrit and Upton were condemned already, the one for stealing Pecos\nDalhart's herd, the other for branding over the Wine-glasses. But the\nlaw demands more than that. It demands evidence that a lawyer can\nread; the sworn testimony of honest and unprejudiced witnesses; the\nidentification of men, brands, and cows, proved beyond a doubt; and\nall this in a country where all cows look alike, all witnesses are\npartisans, and an honest man is the noblest work of God. Boone Morgan\ntook up the long trail to the north with fire in his eye, and he rode\nfuriously, as was his duty, but deep down in his heart he knew he was\nafter the wrong man, and would not even get him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMOUNTAIN LAW\n\n\nAs the sheriff's posse spurred their tired horses up the long slope\nof the rocky mountain and down into the rough country beyond, the\ntrail grew fresher with every hour, until the blood from mutilated\nears showed wet in the trampled dirt. But as the herd made its way\ninto the broken ground the heavy trail split up and divided; at each\nfork of the cañon a bunch was cut off from the drag of the herd and\ndrifted by a hand or two down onto the lower range, and when at last\nthe trail broke out into the open country again the posse was following\nthe tracks of only three men and twenty or thirty cows. Then they\npicked up a stray, burned clean into a Circle-Double-cross and freshly\near-marked, and after that the remnant of the band, standing wearily\nby a water-hole. Every one of them had been freshly branded with a\nhot iron—no hair-brand or attempt at burning through a sack—and half\nof their ears were bloody from being torn in the brush; but there were\nno cowboys loitering near, waiting to be caught with the goods. The\nhorse-tracks still led on until at last they scattered out and mounted\nthe neighboring ridges. But if the trail was lost there were other\nsigns to lead Morgan on his way. The sun was hanging low now, and their\nhorses were jaded from hard riding, but at the familiar bellowing of a\ncow-herd they pricked up their ears and forged ahead. The valley opened\nout suddenly before them and there on their regular _parada_ grounds\nwas the entire U outfit, holding a big herd and cutting, roping,\nand branding by days' works. Innocence and industry were the twin\nwatchwords in that aggregation—they were too busy even to look up—and\nwhen Boone Morgan saw the game he rode past them without speaking and\ntackled the cook for supper.\n\n\"Boys are workin' kinder late to-night, ain't they?\" he observed,\nfilling his plate from the Dutch ovens.\n\n\"Sure are,\" answered the cook, sententiously. He had caught a glimpse\nof a star on a deputy's vest, and his orders were not to talk.\n\n\"Can't even stop to eat, hey?\" continued the sheriff, nodding at an\novenful of cold biscuits that had been wastefully thrown in the dirt.\n\"Well, that's a pity, too, because you sure do make good bread. But a\nsour-dough biscuit ain't never no good unless it's eaten fresh.\"\n\n\"No,\" grumbled the cook, taken off his guard, \"and ef they's anything I\ndo despise it is to cook up a good oven of bread and then have it spile\nthataway.\"\n\n\"Well, we're certainly appreciatin' this batch,\" remarked Morgan,\nglancing genially around at his busy men. \"The boys bein' away\nyesterday kind of threw you out, I reckon.\"\n\n\"Thet's right,\" agreed the cook, oblivious of his intent, \"I hed a big\nkittle of beans spile on me, too.\"\n\n\"They'll sure be hungry when they do hit camp,\" said the sheriff,\ncontinuing his lead, \"livin' on cold grub that way. Hello,\" he\nexclaimed, looking up as John Upton came hurrying in, \"here comes Mr.\nUpton now—ganted down to a shadow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" replied Upton, guardedly, \"b'lieve I could eat a\nlittle, though.\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon you ought to,\" said Morgan, \"after goin' two days on\ncold grub.\"\n\n\"Cold grub!\" repeated the cowman, glancing at the cook.\n\n\"Why, sure. And that's a long, hard ride over to Carrizo, too.\" The\nsheriff took a big mouthful and waited.\n\n\"What in hell you talkin' about?\" demanded the cowman, sullenly.\n\n\"Why, wasn't you over to Carrizo yesterday?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"And never eat no cold grub?\" inquired the sheriff, gazing quizzically\ntoward Joe, the cook.\n\n\"Dam' yore heart, Joe!\" burst out Upton, looking daggers at the\nstartled pot-tender, \"have you been blabbin' already?\"\n\n\"That'll be all, Mr. Upton,\" said Boone Morgan, quietly, \"I'm up\nhere lookin' for the owner of this new Circle Double-cross brand. Is\nthat your iron? It is? Well, I'll have to ask you to go back with me\nto-morrow and explain where them cows come from.\"\n\n\"Well, by the holy—jumpin'—\" The cowman paused in his wrath and fixed\nhis fiery eyes on Boone Morgan. \"Did Ike Crittenden put you up to\nthis?\" he demanded, and taking silence for consent he went off into a\nfrenzy of indignation. \"Well, what you chasin' _me_ for?\" he yelled,\nchoking with exasperation. \"Old Crit goes over into Lost Dog and runs\noff every dam' one of them Monkey-wrench cows, and you come right\nthrough his camp and jump _me_! They wasn't a critter in Lost Dog\nthat hadn't been burnt over my U, and you know it; but ump-um—Crit's\na friend of mine—never make him any trouble—go over and tackle\nUpton—he's a _Tonto_ County man!\"\n\nThe sheriff listened to this tirade with a tolerant smile, feeding\nhimself liberally the while. He had long ago learned that the world's\nsupply of self-righteousness is not held in monopoly by the truly\ngood—also that every horse must go to the length of his picket rope\nbefore he will stop and eat. But when the fireworks were over he\nremarked by way of conversation, \"Crit's got one of your JIC cows down\nthere in his corral—a red three, bald-faced and kind of spotted on the\nshoulders. Looks like it had been branded lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, an' I've got one of his ICU2's down in my corral,\" retorted\nUpton, \"and it sure has been branded lately—you could smell the burnt\nhair when I picked it up five days ago. They ain't a man in my outfit\nthat don't know that old cow for an ICU, too.\"\n\n\"Um,\" commented Morgan, \"you think he stole it, hey?\"\n\n\"I know it!\" replied Upton, with decision. \"You can see her yoreself,\ndown in my headquarters corral, and I picked her up in the track of\nCrit's round-up.\"\n\n\"Well, you better swear out a warrant, then, and we'll take the\ncow down for evidence. You were hintin' that I'm standin' in with\nCrittenden, but jest swear to a complaint and see how quick I'll serve\nthe papers.\"\n\nFor a moment the cowman cocked his head and regarded him shrewdly—then\nhe shook his head. \"I've got too much loose stock runnin' on his\nrange,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll protect your property,\" urged the sheriff. \"Come on, now—quit\nyour kickin' and make a complaint.\"\n\n\"Nope—too dangerous! I can take care of myself in the hills, but if\nthem Geronimo lawyers ever git holt of me I'm done for. You can take me\ndown to-morrer, if you want to, but I'd rather stick to my own game.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the sheriff, \"we'll see what Crit will do.\"\n\nThere was a big crowd around the store at Verde Crossing when Boone\nMorgan and his posse rode in, and at sight of John Upton by his side\nthere was a general craning of necks on the part of Crittenden's\ncowboys. This was the first time that a sheriff had attempted to stop\nthe lawless raids and counter-raids of these two cattle kings and the\ngun-men looked upon him with disfavor, for even a professional bad\nman is jealous of his job. An appeal to the courts would divert their\nextra wages into the pockets of the lawyers—it would dock their pay and\ndouble their work, and to a man they were against it. Yet here came\nUpton with the sheriff, and Bill Todhunter had already spotted some\nSpectacle cows that had drifted back to the corrals. As for Crit, his\nnerve was good, for he felt the fighting courage of his men behind him,\nand he went out to meet his ancient enemy with a taunting sneer.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to see one man git what's comin' to him,\" he observed,\ntaking note of Upton's guard.\n\n\"Yes,\" retorted Upton, caustically, \"and if I'd jest tell a half of\nwhat I know, you'd be mixin' 'dobes down at the Pen.\"\n\n\"Uhr!\" grunted Crittenden, turning away in scorn; but at the same time\nhe took his cue from the words.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Crittenden,\" began Morgan, \"here's the man you wanted\nso bad. Now if you'll jest step into the store and fill out this\ncomplaint—\"\n\n\"Nothin' like that—nothin' like that!\" protested the Verde Boss,\nholding up his hand. \"I never said I wanted him arrested!\"\n\n\"No, but you took me down and showed me that JIC cow and said he stole\nit, didn't you? And you complained to me that he was in the act of\nrunnin' off your Wine-glass cows, didn't you? Well, that's the same\nthing, when you're talkin' to an officer.\"\n\n\"Well, it may be all the same, but I don't want 'im arrested. That\nain't the way I do business.\"\n\n\"Oh, it ain't, hey? Well, what is your way of doin' business?\"\n\n\"First principle is never to holler for help,\" replied Crittenden,\ngrimly. \"I know dam' well that little cuss over there burnt my IC cow\nand run off all my Wine-glasses—but I can't prove nothin' before the\nlaw, so you might as well turn 'im loose. Oh, you don't need to laugh,\nyou little, sawed-off runt!\" he yelled, addressing himself to Upton,\n\"I'm jest keepin' you out of jail so's I can git at you myself! I'll—\"\n\n\"Aw, shut up,\" growled the sheriff, brushing roughly past him. \"Come\non, boys, let's get out of this before they holler their heads off.\"\nHe swung angrily up on his horse, jerked its head toward the river and\ntook the crossing in silence, leaving the rival cattle kings to fight\nit out together. The time might come when one or the other of them\nwould \"holler for help,\" but just at that moment the Verde country was\nnot educated up to the law.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWELCOME HOME\n\n\nAfter the war of words was over and the tumult and shouting had died\naway, the Angel of Peace, which had been flying high of late, fluttered\ndown and hovered low over Verde Crossing. John Upton rode back up the\nTonto trail still breathing forth hostile threats; Crittenden and his\nmen buckled on their extra guns and rode blithely out to the adventure;\nand the store, from being a general hang-out for noisy and drunken\ncowboys, became once more a shrine to Venus and a temple of the Muse,\nwith Babe the minstrel and Marcelina the devotee. \"Billy Veniro\" was\nthe theme—that long, sad tale of the far frontier—sung in tragic tenor\nto a breathless audience of one. She was very pretty, the little\nMarcelina, now that she had become a woman. The Sisters had taught her\nher catechism and something more—the grace and sweetness that come from\nreligious adoration, and the quiet of the cell. The great world, too,\nas personated by Geronimo, had done its share; her hair was done up in\ndark masses, her long skirt swept the floor, and with the added dignity\nof a train her womanhood was complete. She sat by the door where she\ncould watch the Tonto trail—for it was by that road that Pecos was to\ncome—and her melancholy eyes glowed as she listened to the song.\n\n\nBILLY VENIRO\n\n    \"Billy Veniro heard them say, in an Arizona town one day,\n    That a band of Apache Indians were on the trail of death.\n    He heard them tell of murder done, of the men killed at Rocky Run.\n    'There is danger at the cow-ranch!' Veniro cried beneath\n        his breath.\n\n    \"In a ranch forty miles, in a little place that lay\n    In a green and shady valley, in a mighty wilderness,\n    Half a dozen homes were there and in one a maiden fair\n    Helt the heart of Billy Veniro—Billy Veniro's little Bess.\n\n    \"So no wonder he grew pale, when he heard the cowboy's tale—\n    Of the men that he'd seen murdered the day before at Rocky Run.\n    'As sure as there is a God above, I will save the girl I love.\n    By my love for little Bessie, I must see there is something done!'\n\n    \"When his brave resolve was made, not a moment more he stayed.\n    'Why, my man,' his comrades told him when they heard his\n        daring plan,\n    'You are riding straight to death!' But he answered, 'Hold\n        your breath,\n    I may never reach the cow-ranch, but I'll do the best I can.'\n\n    \"As he crossed the alkali bed all his thoughts flew on ahead\n    To the little band at the cow-ranch, thinking not of danger near,\n    With his quirt's unceasing whirl and the jingle of his spurs\n    Little brown Chapo bore the cowboy far away from a far frontier.\n\n    \"Lower and lower sank the sun, he drew reins at Rocky Run.\n    'Here those men met death, my Chapo!' and he stroked his\n        horse's mane.\n    'So shall those we go to warn, ere the breaking of the morn,\n    If I fail, God help my Bessie!' And he started out again.\n\n    \"Sharp and keen the rifle shot woke the echoes of the spot.\n    'I am wounded!' cried Veniro, as he swayed from side to side.\n    'Where there is life there is always hope, onward slowly\n        I will lope.\n    I may never reach the cow-ranch—Bessie dear shall know I tried.\n\n    \"'I will save her yet,' he cried, 'Bessie Lee shall know I died\n    For her sake!' And then he halted in the shadow of a hill.\n    From a branch a twig he broke, and he dipped his pen of oak\n    In the warm blood that spurted from the wound above his heart.\n\n    \"From his chaps he took, with weak hand, a little book,\n    Tore a blank leaf from it, saying, 'This shall be my will.'\n    He arose and wrote: 'Too late! Apache warriors lay in wait.\n    Good-bye, Bess, God bless you, darling!' And he felt the warm\n        blood start.\n\n    \"And he made his message fast—love's first letter and its last—\n    To his saddle horn he tied it, while his lips were white with pain.\n    'Take this message, if not me, safe to little Bess,' said he.\n    Then he tied himself to the saddle and gave his horse the rein.\n\n    \"Just at dusk a horse of brown, wet with sweat, came panting down\n    Through the little lane at the cow-ranch and stopped at\n        Bessie's door.\n    But the cowboy was asleep and his slumbers were so deep\n    That little Bess could not awake him, if she were to\n        try forevermore.\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n    \"Now you have heard this story told, by the young and by the old,\n    Way down there at the cow-ranch the night the Apaches came.\n    Heard them speak of the bloody fight, how the chief fell in\n        the flight\n    And of those panic-stricken warriors, when they speak\n        Veniro's name.\"\n\n           *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ay, _los_ Ah-paches!\" sighed Marcelina, looking wistfully up the\ntrail. \"No _ai_ Ah-paches in mountains now, Babe?\"\n\n\"No, Marcelina,\" soothed Angy, \"all gone now. Soldiers watch 'em—San\nCarlos.\"\n\n\"_Que malo, los Indios!_\" shuddered Marcelina. \"I am afraid—_quien\nsabe?_—who can tell?—I am afraid some bad men shall keel—ah, when say\nPaycos, he will come?\"\n\n\"'I'll come a-runnin'—watch for my dust'—that's all he wrote when I\ntold him you was home. Can't you see no dust nor nothin'?\"\n\n\"There is leetle smoke, like camp-fire, up the valley—and Creet's\nvaqueros come home down Tonto trail. Pretty soon sundown—nobody come.\"\n\nAngevine Thorne stepped through the doorway and, shading his bloodshot\neyes with a grimy hand, gazed long at the column of thin smoke against\nthe northern sky. \"Like as not some one is brandin' an _orejano_\" he\nsaid, half to himself. \"Might even be Pecos, makin' a signal fire. Hey,\nlook at them bloody cowboys, ridin' in on it! Look at 'em go down that\n_arroyo_; will you? Say—I hope—\"\n\n\"Hope what?\"\n\n\"Well, I hope Pecos don't come across none of them Spectacle cows on\nthe way in—that's all.\"\n\n\"Ahh, Paycos weel be mad—he weel—_Mira!_ Look, look!\"\n\nA furious mob of horsemen came whirling down the trail, crowding about\na central object that swayed and fought in their midst; they rushed\nit triumphantly into the open, swinging their ropes and shouting, and\nas the rout went by Angy saw Pecos, tied to his horse, his arms bound\ntight to his sides and a myriad of tangled reatas jerking him about in\nhis saddle.\n\n[Illustration: As the rout went by Angy saw Pecos, tied to his horse,\nhis arms bound tight to his sides]\n\n\"Hang the cow-thief!\" howled the cowboys, circling and racing back, and\nall the time Pecos strained and tugged to get one hand to his gun. Then\nhis wild eyes fell on Marcelina and he paused; she held out her hands,\nand Angy rushed behind the bar for his gun.\n\n\"Here, what the hell you mean?\" he yelled, breaking from the door.\n\"Quit jerkin' him around like that, or I'll knock you off your horse!\"\nHe ran straight through the crowd, belting every horse he met with the\nbarrel of his forty-five, until he brought up with his back to Pecos\nand his pistol on the mob. \"Let go that rope, you—!\" he cried, bringing\nhis six-shooter to a point, and as the nearest cowboy threw loose and\nbacked away he shifted his gun to another. \"Throw off your dally,\" he\ncommanded, \"and you too, you low-flung Missouri hound! Yes, I mean\nyou!\" he shouted, as Crit still held his turns. \"What right have you\ngot to drag this man about? I'll shoot the flat out of your eye, you\nold dastard, if you don't let go that rope!\"\n\nOld Crit let go, but he stood his ground with a jealous eye on his\nprize.\n\n\"Don't you tech them ropes,\" he snarled back, \"or I'll do as much for\nyou. I caught him in the act of stealin' one of my cows and—\"\n\n\"You _did_ not!\" broke in Pecos, leaning back like a wing-broke hawk to\nface his exultant foe, \"that calf was mine—and its mother to boot—and\nyou go and burn it to a pair of Spectacles! Can't a man vent his own\ncalf when it's been stole on 'im durin' his absence? Turn me loose,\nyou one-eyed cow-thief, or I'll have yore blood for this!\"\n\n\"You don't git loose from me—not till the sheriff comes and takes you\nto the jug. Close in here, boys, and we'll tie him to a tree.\"\n\n\"Not while I'm here!\" replied Angy, stepping valiantly to the front.\n\"They don't a man lay a finger on 'im, except over my dead body. You'll\nhave to kill me—or I'll pot Old Crit on you, in spite of hell!\" He\nthrew down on his boss with the big forty-five and at a sign from Crit\nthe cowboys fell back and waited.\n\n\"Now, lookee here, Angy,\" began Crittenden, peering uneasily past the\ngun, \"I want you to keep yore hand outer this. Accordin' to law, any\ncitizen has a right to arrest a man caught in the act of stealin' and I\nclaim that feller for my prisoner.\"\n\n\"Well, you don't git 'im,\" said Angy, shortly. \"What's the row, Pecos?\"\n\nPecos Dalhart, still leaning back like a crippled hawk that offers beak\nand claws to the foe, shifted his hateful eyes from Crittenden and\nfixed them on his friend.\n\n\"I was ridin' down the _arroyo_,\" he said, \"a while ago, when I came\nacross my old milk cow that I bought of Joe Garcia.\" He paused and\ngulped with rage. \"One ear was cropped to a grub,\" he cried, \"and the\nother swallow-forked to 'er head—and her brand was fresh burnt to\na pair of hobbles! The calf carried the same brand and while I was\nbarring them Spectacles or Hobbles, or whatever you call 'em, and\nputting a proper Monkey-wrench in their place, this pack of varmints\njumped in and roped me before I could draw a gun, otherwise they would\nbe some dead.\"\n\n\"Nothin' of the kind!\" shouted back Crittenden. \"You never bought a cow\nin your life, and you know it! I caught you in the act of stealin' my\nSpectacle calf and I've got witnesses to prove it—ain't that so, boys?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" chimed the IC cowboys, edging in behind their boss.\n\n\"And I demand that man for my prisoner!\" he concluded, though\npacifically, for Angy still kept his bead.\n\nThe negotiations for the custody of Pecos were becoming heated when\nthere was a familiar clatter at the ford and Bill Todhunter rode\ninto camp. His appearance was not such an accident as on the surface\nappeared, since he had been scouting around the purlieus of Verde\nCrossing for some days in the hope of catching Old Crit in some overt\nact, but he put a good face on it and took charge of the prisoner at\nonce. Prisoners were the fruits of his profession, like game to a\nhunter or mavericks to a cowman, and he pulled the gun out of Pecos's\nholster and threw loose the tangled ropes with the calm joy of a man\nwho has made a killing.\n\n\"Caught 'im in the act, did ye?\" he said, turning to Crittenden.\n\"Uh-huh—got any witnesses? All right—where's the calf? Well, send a\nman up for it, and bring the cow down, too. We'll have a preliminary\nexamination before the J. P. to-morrow and I want that cow and calf\nfor evidence. Now come on, Mr. Dalhart, and remember that anything you\nsay is liable to be used against ye.\"\n\nDenying and protesting, Pecos did as he was bid; and, still denying\nhis guilt, he went before the magistrate in Geronimo. Crittenden was\nthere with his cowboys; the calf was there with his barred brand and\nbloody ears—and as the examination progressed Pecos saw the meshes of a\nmighty net closing relentlessly in upon him. In vain he protested that\nthe calf was his—Isaac Crittenden, the cowman, swore that the animal\nbelonged to him and his cowboys swore to it after him. In vain he\ncalled upon José Garcia to give witness to the sale—Joe was in debt to\nthe Boss several hundred dollars and Old Funny-face, the cow, was being\nhazed across the range by a puncher who had his orders. His written\nbill of sale was lost, the mother with her brands and vents was gone,\nand a score of witnesses against him swore to the damning fact that he\nhad been taken red-handed. After hearing all the evidence the Justice\nof the Peace consulted his notes, frowned, and held the defendant\nfor the action of the grand jury. The witnesses filed out, the court\nadjourned, and a representative assemblage of cowmen congratulated\nthemselves, as law-abiding citizens of Geronimo County, that there was\none less rustler in the hills. At last, after holding up her empty\nscales for years, the star-eyed Goddess of Justice was vindicated; the\nmills of the law had a proper prisoner to work upon now and though they\nwere likely to grind a little slow—the grand jury had just adjourned\nand would not be convened again until fall—they were none the less\nlikely to be sure. Fortunately for the cause of good government the\niron hand of the law had closed down upon a man who had neither money,\nfriends, nor influence, and everybody agreed that he should be made an\nawful example.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE KANGAROO COURT\n\n\nThere are some natures so stern and rugged that they lean against a\nstorm like sturdy, wind-nourished pines, throwing back their arms,\nshaking their rough heads, and making strength from the elemental\nstrife. Of such an enduring breed was Pecos Dalhart and as he stood\nbefore the judge, square-jawed, eagle-eyed, with his powerful shoulders\nthrown back, he cursed the law that held him more than the men who\nhad sworn him into jail. But behind that law stood every man of the\ncommonwealth, and who could fight them all, lone-handed? Lowering his\nhead he submitted, as in ancient days the conquered barbarians bowed to\nthe Roman yoke, but there was rebellion in his heart and he resolved\nwhen the occasion offered to make his dream of the revolution a waking\nreality. The deputy who led him over to jail seemed to sense his\nprisoner's mood and left him strictly alone, showing the way in silence\nuntil they entered the sheriff's office.\n\nThe reception room to the suite of burglar-proof apartments familiarly\nknown as the Hotel de Morgan was a spacious place, luxuriously\nfurnished with lounging chairs and cuspidors and occupied at the moment\nby Boone Morgan, a visiting deputy, three old-timers, and a newspaper\nreporter. The walls were decorated with a galaxy of hard-looking\npictures labelled \"Escaped\" and \"Reward,\" many of which had written\nacross their face \"Caught,\" and some \"Killed\"; there was a large desk\nin the corner, a clutter of daily papers on the floor, and the odor\nof good cigars. Upon the arrival of Pecos Dalhart the sheriff was\nengaged in telling a story, which he finished. Then he turned in his\nswivel-chair, sorted out a pen and opened a big book on the desk.\n\n\"Mr. Dalhart, I believe,\" he said, smiling a little grimly.\n\nPecos grunted, and the deputy taking the cue, began a systematic search\nof his pockets.\n\n\"Grand larceny—held for the grand jury,\" he supplemented, and the\nsheriff wrote it down in the book thoughtfully.\n\n\"Sorry I can't give you the bridal chamber, Mr. Dalhart,\" he continued,\n\"but it's occupied by a check-raiser; and I wouldn't think of puttin'\na cowman in the jag-cell with all them sheep-herders—so I'll have to\ngive you Number Six, on the first floor front. Pretty close quarters\nthere now, but you'll have all the more company on that account, and\nI'll guarantee the boys will make you welcome.\" He paused and winked\nat the reporter, who sharpened a pencil and laughed. Boone Morgan's\nKangaroo Court was a local institution which gave him a great deal of\njosh copy in the course of a year and he lit a cigar and waited to\nobserve Pecos Dalhart's reception. The kangaroo _alcalde_ or judge was\na horse-thief, the sheriff was a noted strong-arm man from the East,\nthe district attorney was an ex-lawyer taking a graduate course in\npenology, and altogether they made a very taking _dramatis personæ_ for\nlittle knockdown skits on court-house life.\n\n\"Mr. Pecos Dalhart, cowman and brand-expert extraordinary, is down from\nthe Verde for a few days and is stopping at the Hotel de Morgan pending\nthe action of the grand jury in regard to one spotted calf alleged to\nhave been feloniously and unlawfully taken from Isaac Crittenden, the\ncattle king. In the absence of the regular reception committee, Michael\nSlattery, the kangaroo sheriff, conducted Mr. Dalhart before his honor\nthe alcalde who welcomed him in a neat speech and conferred upon him\nthe freedom of the city. After a delightful half-hour of rough-house\nthe entire company sat down to a choice collation of fruit provided by\nthe generosity of the guest of honor.\"\n\nSomething like that would go very well and be good for the drinks in\nhalf the saloons in town. Only, of course, he must not forget to put in\na little puff about the sheriff—\"Sheriff Morgan is very proud of the\nexcellent order maintained in the county jail,\" or something equally\nacceptable.\n\nThe deputy continued his search of Pecos Dalhart's person, piling\nmoney, letters, jack-knife, and trinkets upon the desk and feeling\ncarefully along his coat lining and the bulging legs of his boots—but\nPecos said never a word. It was a big roll of bills that he had brought\nback from New Mexico—five months' pay and not a dollar spent. Some\nfellows would have the nerve to get married on that much money. There\nwas a genuine eighteen-carat, solitaire-diamond engagement-ring among\nhis plunder, too, but it was no good to him now. The sheriff examined\nit curiously while he was counting the money and sealing the whole\ntreasure in a strong envelope.\n\n\"I'm _dam'_ sorry I can't give you that bridal chamber,\" he observed,\nflashing the diamond and glancing quizzically at the reporter, and\nPecos felt the hot blood leap throbbing to his brain.\n\n\"You go to hell, will you?\" he growled, and a dangerous light came into\nhis eyes as he rolled them on the laughing crowd.\n\n\"Here, here!\" chided the deputy, grabbing him roughly by the arm, and\nwith the gang following closely upon his heels he led the way to the\ncells. A rank smell, like the cagey reek of a menagerie, smote their\nnostrils as they passed through the first barred door and at sight\nof another prisoner the men inside the tanks let out a roar of joy\nand crowded up to the bars. It was the flush time of year, when the\ndistrict court was in session, and the authors of six months' crime and\ndisorder were confined within that narrow space awaiting the pleasure\nof the judge. Some there were with the healthy tan of the sun still\nupon their cheeks, and the swarthy sons of Mexico showed no tendency\nto prison pallor, but most of the faces were white and tense, with\nobscenely staring eyes and twitching lips, and all of them were weary\nunto death. Like wild beasts that see a victim led to their gate they\nstormed and chattered against the bars, shouting strange words that\nPecos could not understand until, at an order from the deputy, they\nscuttled back to their cells.\n\nThe Geronimo County jail was a massive structure of brick, pierced\nby high windows set with iron gratings. A narrow corridor led around\nthe sides, separating the great double-decked steel tanks from the\nouter wall, and within this triumph of the iron-master's craft the\nvictims of the law's delay swarmed about like chipmunks in a cage.\nDown the middle of the steel enclosure there extended a long corridor\nwith washrooms at the end and on either side were rows of cells, with\nnarrow, inter-connected gates which could be opened and closed from\nwithout. At the word of command each prisoner slipped deftly through\nhis door; the deputy unlocked an iron box, heaved away upon a lever,\nand with a resounding clang all the gratings on one side came to and\nwere fastened by the interlocking rods. He opened a box on the opposite\nside of the entrance and clanged those doors in place, thus locking up\nthe last of his dangerous charges and leaving the corridor empty. Then,\nproducing another key, he unlocked the great sliding gate, pulled its\nheavy panels ajar, and shoved Pecos roughly through the aperture. Once\nmore the gates clashed behind him, the interlocking cell doors flew\nopen, and with a whoop the uncaged prisoners stepped forth and viewed\ntheir victim.\n\nThere is no pretence about a kangaroo court. By luck and good conduct\na citizen of the outer world may entirely escape the punitive hand of\nthe law, but every man who entered the Geronimo County jail was _ipso\nfacto_ a delinquent. More than that, he was foredoomed to conviction,\nfor there is no law so merciless as that of the law's offenders. The\nrulings of the kangaroo alcalde are influenced by neither pleadings\nnor precedents, and his tyranny is mitigated only by the murmurings\nof his constituents and the physical limitations of his strong right\nhand. Unless by the heinousness of his former acts he has placed\nhimself in the aristocracy of crime, he must be prepared to defend his\nhigh position against all comers; and as the insignia of his office he\ncarries a strap, with the heavy end of which he administers summary\npunishment and puts down mutinies and revolts. Pete Monat was the\ndoughty alcalde in the Geronimo Bastile, and he ruled with an iron\nhand. For sheriff he had Michael Slattery, a mere yegg, to do the dirty\nwork and hale prisoners before the court. The district attorney was\nJohn Doe, a fierce argufier, who if his nerve had been equal to his\nambition would long since have usurped the alcalde's place. There were\nlikewise jail-lawyers galore, petty grafters who pitted their wits\nagainst the prosecuting attorney in a brave attempt to earn a fee, or\nat least to establish a factitious claim against the defendant. Out\nthey surged, sheriff, lawyers, and alcalde, and bore down on Pecos in a\nbody, the sheriff to arrest him, the lawyers to get his case, and the\nalcalde to tip his chair against the grating, where the reporter could\nsee all the fun,—and try the case in style.\n\n\"Fuzzy!\" thundered the yegg sheriff, laying a heavy hand upon Pecos's\nshoulder, \"I arrest youse in the name of the law!\"\n\n\"The hell you say!\" exclaimed Pecos, backing off; and in an instant\nthe hardened jail-birds knew that they had a \"gay-cat.\" Only Rubes and\ngay-cats resisted arrest in jail—the old-timers stepped up promptly,\nbefore the sheriff could \"give them the roust\" from behind.\n\n\"Yes, an' fer breakin' into jail!\" hollered Slattery. \"Come on now and\ndon't make me any trouble or I'll cop youse in the mush!\"\n\n\"Arraign the prisoner,\" shouted the alcalde pompously, \"bring 'im up\nhyar, an' ef he's half as bad as he looks he'll git the holy limit.\nWake up thar, you, an' he'p the sheriff, or I'll set you to scrubbin'\nfloors.\"\n\nThey came in a struggling mass, dominated by the tall form of the\nsheriff, and before Pecos was aware of his destiny he was hustled\nbefore the judge.\n\n\"What is the charge against this mug?\" inquired Pete Monat, slapping\nhis strap across his knee for silence.\n\n\"Breakin' inter jail, Yer Honor!\" responded the sheriff, bowing and\ntouching his forelock.\n\n\"Prisoner at the bar,\" declaimed the alcalde, \"you are charged with\nwilfully, feloniously, an' unlawfully breakin' inter this hyar jail—do\nyou plead 'Guilty' or 'Not guilty'?\"\n\n\"I don't plead,\" said Pecos, with suspicious quiet.\n\n\"'Don't plead' is the same as 'Not guilty,'\" announced the judge, \"and\nbein' as the district attorney is such a long-winded yap I'll jest pull\noff this examination myse'f. How come you're hyar, then, you low-browed\nreperbate, ef you didn't break inter jail? Answer me thet, now, an' be\ndam' careful to say 'Yer Honor' or I'll soak you for contempt of court!\"\n\n\"Say,\" said Pecos, speaking through the gratings to Boone Morgan, \"do\nI have to stand for this? I do? Well, to hell with such a layout!\nHere, keep your hands off o' me now, or somebody'll git badly hurt!\"\nHe placed his back against the grating and menaced the strong-armed\nsheriff with a tense fist, turning a scornful eye upon the clamoring\njudge.\n\n\"_Oyez! Oyez!_ Silence in the court!\" bellowed Pete Monat, leaping up\non his chair. \"The prisoner is found guilty and sentenced to pay a fine\nof one dollar, or pack out the slops for a week! Mr. Sheriff, bring 'im\nup, an' ef he resists we'll give 'im thirty slaps with this hyar!\" He\nheld up his black strap threateningly, but Pecos only skinned his teeth\nlike a wolf that is caught in a trap, and stood at bay.\n\n\"I'd like to see the bunch of hobos that can man-handle _me_!\" he\nsnarled, making a pass at the sheriff. \"Hey, bring me a dollar!\" he\ncommanded, speaking over his shoulder, and as the deputy went back to\nthe office to get one from his envelope the Roman mob fell back and\nceased its clamoring. The dollar was what they wanted. There was always\na Mex to clean up, but the dollar went for a feed—fruit, candy, good\nthings to eat—and not every man who entered could pay his fine. At the\nsame time they stood off a little from the prisoner at the bar, for he\nhad a bad look in his eye. The kangaroo sheriff, standing discreetly\naloof, noticed it; the alcalde also; and in the premonitory hush that\nensued even Boone Morgan began to read the signs of trouble. Next to\nhis dream of breaking up the cattle-stealing business in the mountains,\nthe Geronimo sheriff cherished the fond hope of building up a kangaroo\ncourt that would take the entire problem of jail discipline off his\nhands. It was an old idea, the kangaroo court, dimly reminiscent of\nfrontier cow-camps but smelling more of hoboism, yet good for law and\norder if the right men were in power. Pete Monat was a terror to the\nevil-doer, especially if he was a Mex or darker, and Boone Morgan stood\ngenerously behind him, even when his decisions were a little rank.\nRight now the situation looked ominous and as Pecos continued to spit\nforth his venom, hissing and swelling like a snake at every approach of\nthe pack, he made bold to interfere in the puppet play.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, passing a dollar through the bars, \"I'll advance you\nthe money—these fellows won't hurt you none.\"\n\n\"Keep your dirty dollar!\" snapped Pecos, striking it away, \"I got money\nof my own!\"\n\n\"Well, you don't need to git mad about it—I jest wanted to help you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you help me! You throw me into jail for somethin' I never done\nand then bring this bunch of town boys in to see me kangarooed. That\nbig stiff hain't got no right to fine me a dollar, an' you know it,\nbut I'll give him the money all right—you jest wait!\" He grinned\nsardonically at Michael Slattery, straightened his back and waited. He\nhad all the time there was—the grand jury did not meet till Fall, and\nthat was six months yet. This was the law they talked about—this was\njustice—to hold a man six months before he came to trial! Shut him up\nin that dark, stinking hole and keep him until he was broken! Sure—and\nlet a bunch of yeggs spread-eagle him over a chair and beat him with a\nstrap! For a year Pecos had been at war with society and never struck a\nblow for the revolution. But it was not too late. In turning him over\nto a kangaroo court Boone Morgan had added the last indignity—it was\nwar now, and war to the knife.\n\nThe deputy returned leisurely, and shoved a dollar bill through the\nbars.\n\n\"Much obliged,\" said Pecos, and he spoke so quietly that even the\nkangaroo sheriff was deceived. \"Here's your dollar,\" he said, turning\nto hold out the money, \"come and git it.\" There was a sinister note\nin that last phrase, but Slattery did not catch it. He was a tall,\nhulking man, heavy-handed and used to his own way; the cattle-rustler\nwas short and broad, like a stocky, hard-rock miner, and he stood with\nhis back to the bars as if he were afraid. \"Come and git it,\" he said,\nvery quietly, but as Mike Slattery reached out his hand for the money\nthe cowboy grinned and jerked it back. Slattery grabbed, and like a\nflash Pecos put over a blow that was freighted with sudden death. It\nlanded behind the yegg sheriff's massive jaw, threw him sideways and\nwhirled him over; then the thud of the blow was followed by a thump\nand like a boneless carcass he piled up on the floor. To a man a few\nremoves farther from the ape the thump on the concrete floor would\nhave resulted in a cracked skull, but fortunately for Slattery hard\nheads and evil dispositions generally go together, and he was safe from\nanything short of an axe. It was the blow under the ear that had jarred\nhis brains—the bump against the concrete only finished the job up\nand saved him from something worse. Without looking to see where his\nvictim fell Pecos Dalhart leapt vengefully into the swarming crowd of\nprisoners, knocking them right and left like ten-pins and shouting in a\nhoarse voice:\n\n\"Come an'—_huh_—git it! Come—_huh_—and _git_ it!\" And at every grunt he\nsent home a blow that laid his man on the floor.\n\n\"Back to your cells!\" roared Boone Morgan, rattling the grating like a\nlion caged away from a deadly battle. \"Git back there and let me have\na chance!\" But his voice was drowned in the deep-voiced challenge of\nPecos, the shrieks of trampled Mexicans, the curses and sound of blows.\nPandemonium broke loose and in the general uproar all semblance of\norder was lost. On the outside of the bars a pair of shouting deputies\nmenaced the flying demon of discord with their pistols, calling on him\nto stop; Boone Morgan tried to clear the corridor so that he could open\nthe door; but they might as well have thundered against the wind, for\nPecos Dalhart had gone hog wild and panic lay in his wake.\n\n\"Yeee-pah!\" he screamed, as the way cleared up before him. \"Hunt your\nholes, you prairie dogs, or I'll shore deal you misery! Out of my road,\nyou dastards—I'm lookin' for that alcalde!\" He fought his way down the\ncorridor, leaving his mark on every man who opposed him, and Pete Monat\ncame half way to meet him. Pete had been a fighter himself when he\nfirst broke into the Geronimo jail and the confinement had not thinned\nhis sporting blood. He held the alcalde's strap behind him, doubled\nto give it weight, and at the very moment that Pecos came lunging in\nhe laid it across his cheek with a resounding whack. The angry blood\nstood out along the scar and before Pecos could dodge back he received\nanother welt that all but laid him low.\n\n\"Hit 'im again! Smash 'im! Fly at 'im, Pete!\" yelled the crowd without,\nand at the appearance of a leader the beaten gang of hobos came out of\ntheir holes like bloodhounds. Pecos heard the scuffle of feet behind\nhim and turned to meet them. The fury in his eye was terrible, but he\nwas panting, and he staggered as he dodged a blow. For a single moment\nhe appraised the fighting odds against him—then with an irresistible\nrush he battered his way past the alcalde and grabbed the back of\nhis chair. In the sudden turmoil and confusion that humble throne of\njustice had been overlooked. It stood against the grating beyond which\nBoone Morgan and his deputies cheered on the kangaroos, and as Pecos\nwhirled it in the air their shouting ceased.\n\nThere was a crash, a dull thump, and Pete Monat pitched forward with\nhis throne hung round his neck. The strap which had left its cruel mark\non Pecos fell to the floor before him, and Pecos, dropping the broken\nback of the chair, stooped and picked it up. The alcalde lay silent now\nbeside the inert body of his sheriff and a great hush fell upon the\nprison as he stood over them, glaring like a lion at bay. He held up a\nbruised and gory fist and opened it tauntingly.\n\n\"Here's your dollar,\" he said, waving the bloody bill above his head,\n\"come and git it, you sons of goats! You don't want it, hey? Well,\ngit back into your cells, then—in with you, or I'll lash you to a\nfrazzle!\" They went, and as the interlocking doors clanged behind them\nPecos turned to Boone Morgan and laughed. \"That's what I think of your\nKangaroo Court,\" he said, \"and your own dam' rotten laws. Here's to the\nrevolution!\"\n\nHe flung his blood-red arms above his head and laughed again, bitterly;\nand after they had carried out the injured he paced up and down the\ncorridor all night, cursing and raving against the law, while the\nbattered inmates gazed out through their bars or nodded in troubled\nsleep. It was the revolution—no laws, no order, no government, no\nnothing! The base hirelings of the law had thrown him into jail—all\nright, he would put their jail on the bum.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE REVOLUTION IN FACT\n\n\nOutside of the kangarooing of Rubes, the coming and going of prisoners,\nand such exceptional entertainment as that put up by Pecos Dalhart\nupon his initiation into the brotherhood, there were only two events a\nday in the Geronimo jail—breakfast and dinner. Breakfast, as with the\nFrench, was served late, and dinner at the hour of four. On account\nof the caterer being otherwise engaged in the early morning the\n_café-au-lait_ in bed was dispensed with and _déjeuner_ served promptly\nat nine. It was a hard-looking aggregation of citizens that crept out\nof their cells at the clanging of the interlocking gates and there was\nnot a man among them who dared look Pecos in the eye as they slunk\ndown the corridor to wash. Battered in body and cowed in spirit they\nglanced up at him deprecatingly as he stood with the strap in his hand,\nand there was no mercy written in the cattle-rustler's scowling visage.\nThese were the men who would have put their heels in his face if he\nhad gone down before their rush—they were cowards and ran in packs,\nlike wolves. They were grafters, too; the slinking, servile slaves of\njail alcaldes, yegg sheriffs, and Boone Morgan's swaggering deputies.\nMore than that, they would mob him if he gave them half a chance. So he\nstood silent, watching them, man after man, and there was not one who\ncould look him in the face.\n\nIt was Bill Todhunter who opened the gates that morning—the same\nkeen-eyed, silent deputy who had fetched Pecos down from the\nmountains—and as his former prisoner, now transformed into the stern\nmaster of Geronimo jail, came near, he looked him over gravely.\n\n\"Feelin' any better?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Nope,\" scowled Pecos, and there the matter dropped. After the affair\nof the night before he had expected to be put in irons, at least, or\nthrown into the dungeon, but nobody seemed to be worrying about him,\nand the prison routine went on as usual. The drunks in the jag-cell\nwoke up and began to wrangle; the long-termers in the deck above\nscuffled sullenly around over the resounding boiler plate; and from\nthe outer office they could hear the cheerful voices of old-timers\nand politicians discussing affairs of state. A long-term trusty came\nclattering down the iron stairs and passed out through the two barred\ndoors to work up an appetite for breakfast by mowing the court-house\nlawn. As for Pecos, he was used to having his breakfast early and his\nTrojan exertions of the night before had left him gaunted, though he\ncarried off his stoic part bravely. Nevertheless he showed a more than\nhuman interest in the steel front gate, and when at last, just as the\nclock tolled nine, it swung open, admitting the Chinese _restaurateur_\nwho contracted for their meals, there was a general chorus of\napproval. Hung Wo was the name of this caterer to the incarcerated,\nand he looked it; but though his face was not designed for a laughing\npicture his shoulders were freighted with two enormous cans which\nmore than made up for that. Without a word to any one he lowered the\ncans to the floor, jerked off the covers, and began to dish up on the\nprison plates. To every man he gave exactly the same—a big spoonful of\nbeans, a potato, a hunk of meat, half a loaf of bread, and a piece of\npie—served with the rapidity of an automaton.\n\nWithout waiting for orders the prisoners retreated noisily into their\ncells and waited, the more fastidious shoving sheets of newspaper\nthrough the small openings at the bottom of their doors to keep their\nplates off the floor. But here again there was trouble. The incessant\nhammering of pint coffee cups emphasized the starved impatience of\nthe inmates; the food grew cold on the plates; only one thing lay in\nthe way of the belated breakfast—Pecos refused to go into a cell.\nBefore the fall of the kangaroo court it had been the privilege and\nprerogative of Mike Slattery to remain in the corridor and assist\nin the distribution of the food, but Mike was in the bridal chamber\nnow with his jowls swathed in cotton, sucking a little nourishment\nthrough a tube. Pete Monat was there also, his head bandaged to the\nlimit of the physician's art, and mourning the fate which had left him\nsuch a hard-looking mug on the eve of a jury trial. The verdict would\nbe guilty, that was a cinch. But at least Pete was able to eat his\nbreakfast, whereas there were about forty avid kangaroos in the tanks\nwho were raising their combined voices in one agonizing appeal for\nfood. It was a desperate situation, but Pecos, as usual, was obdurate.\n\n\"Let the Chink come in—I won't hurt 'im!\" he said; but Bill Todhunter\nshook his head.\n\n\"The Chink won't come,\" he said.\n\n\"Whassa malla _Mike_?\" inquired Hung Wo nervously. \"He go Yuma?\"\n\n\"No, Charley,\" returned Todhunter, \"last night he have one hell of a\nbig fight—this man break his jaw.\"\n\n\"Whassa malla _Pete_?\"\n\n\"This man break his head with chair.\"\n\n\"Ooo!\" breathed Hung Wo, peering through the bars, \"me no go in.\"\n\n\"Well, now, you see what you git for your cussedness,\" observed the\ndeputy coldly. \"The Chink won't come in and the chances are you'll\nstarve to death; that is, providin' them other fellers don't beat you\nto death first, for makin' 'em lose their breakfast. Feelin' pretty\ncagey, ain't they?\"\n\nThey were, and Pecos realized that if he didn't square himself with\nHung Wo right away and get him to feed the animals, he would have a\nbread riot on his hands later—and besides, he was hungry himself. So he\nspoke quickly and to the point.\n\n\"What's the matter, Charley?\" he expostulated, \"you 'fraid of me?\"\n\n\"Me no likee!\" said the Chinaman impersonally.\n\n\"No, of course not; but here—lemme tell you! You savvy Pete Monat—all\nsame alcalde, eh? You savvy Mike—all same boss, hey? Well, last night\nme lick Pete and Mike. You see this strap? All right; _me_ boss now—you\ngive me big pie every day, you come in!\"\n\n\"Me no got big pie to-day,\" protested Hung Wo anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right—me takum other feller's pie, this time—you come\nin!\"\n\n\"Allite!\" agreed the simple-minded Oriental, and when the iron doors\nrolled apart he entered without a quiver. Back where he came from a\nbargain is a bargain and it is a poor boss indeed who does not demand\nhis rake-off. The day was won and, throwing back his head imperiously,\nPecos stalked down the line of cells until he came to the one where the\ninmates were making the most noise.\n\n\"Here!\" he said, and when they looked up he remarked: \"You fellers are\ntoo gay to suit me—I'll jest dock you your pieces of pie!\" And when the\nChinaman arrived Pecos carefully lifted the pie from each plate and\npiled all up on his own. \"This'll teach you to keep your mouths shut!\"\nhe observed, and retiring to the iron gates he squatted down on his\nheels and ate greedily.\n\n\"Well, the son-of-a-gun,\" murmured Bill Todhunter, as he took notice\nof this final triumph, and the men in the cells became as quiet as a\ncage of whip-broke beasts when the lion tamer stands in their midst.\nAs Pecos Dalhart drank his second cup of coffee and finished up the\nlast slab of pie a realizing sense of his mastery came over him and he\nsmiled grimly at the watchful faces that peered out through the cell\ngratings, blinking and mowing like monkeys in a zoo. They were beaten,\nthat was plain, but somehow as he looked them over he was conscious of\na primordial cunning written on every savage visage—they bowed before\nhim; but like the leopards before their tamer, they crouched, too. That\nwas it—they crouched and bided their time, and when the time came they\nwould hurl themselves at his throat. But what was it for which they\nwere waiting? All the morning he pondered on it as he paced to and fro\nor sat with his back to the bars, watching. Then, as the day warmed up\nand his head sank momentarily against his breast he woke with a start\nto behold a prison-bleached hand reaching, reaching for his strap.\nInstantly he rose up from his place and dealt out a just retribution,\nlaying on his strap with the accuracy of a horse-wrangler, but even\nwith the howling of his victim in his ears he was afraid, for he read\nthe hidden meaning of that act. With the nerveless patience of the\nbeast they were waiting for him to go to sleep!\n\nOnce before, on the open range, Pecos Dalhart had arrayed himself\nagainst society, and lost, even as he was losing now. Sooner or later,\nby day or by night, these skulking hyenas of the jail-pack would catch\nhim asleep, and he shuddered to think how they might mangle him. He\nsaw it clearly now, the fate of the man who stands alone, without a\nfriend to watch over him or a government to protect his life. Not in\ntwo hurly-burly days and nights had he closed his bloodshot eyes,\nand as the heaviness of sleep crept upon him he paced up and down\nthe corridor, wrestling with the spectre that was stealing away his\nwits and hoping against hope that Boone Morgan would come to his aid,\nfor Boone had seen his finish from the first. In sodden abandonment\nto his destiny he looked one of the cells over to see if it could be\nbarricaded, but when one door was open they were all open and there\nwas no protection against stealth or assault. He had not even the\nprotection of the cave-dweller who, when sleep overcame him, could\nretire and roll a great stone against his door. Yet as the possession\nof sleep took hold upon him he routed out the inmates of the cell\nnearest to the gate, climbed into the upper bunk and lay there, rigid,\nfighting to keep awake.\n\nIt was quiet now and the shuffling of the long-termers above him came\nfainter and fainter; some drunk out in the jag-cell woke up from his\nlong slumber and began to sing mournfully; and Pecos, struggling\nagainst the deadly anæsthetic of his weariness, listened intently to\nevery word.\n\n    \"My friends and relations has caused a separation,\"\n\nchanted the dirge-like voice of the singer,\n\n    \"Concerning the part of some favorite one.\n    Besides their vexation and great trubbelation\n    They will some time be sorry for what they have done.\"\n\nThe voice sounded familiar to Pecos—or was it the music?—well, never\nmind, he would hear it to the end.\n\n    \"My fortune is small, I will truly confess it,\n    But what I have got it is all of my own,\n    I might have lived long in this world and enjoyed it\n    If my cruel friends could have left me alone.\n\n    \"Farewell to this country, I now must leave it,\n    And seek my way to some far distant land.\n    My horse and my saddle is a source of all pleasure\n    And when I meet friend I'll join heart and hand.\n\n    \"Farewell to the girl that I no more shall see,\n    This world is wide and I'll spend it in pleasures,\n    And I don't care for no girl that don't care for me,\n    I'll drink and be jolly and not care for no downfall.\n\n    \"I'll drownd my troubles in a bottle of wine;\n    I'll drownd them away in a full-flowing bumper\n    And ride through the wild to pass away time.\n    And when Death calls for me I'll follow him home.\n\n    \"No wife, no children will be left to suffer,\n    Not even a sweetheart will be left to mourn.\n    I'll be honest and fair in all my transactions,\n    Whatever I do, I intend to be true.\n\n    \"Here is health and good wishes to all you fair ladies—\n    It is hard, boys, to find one that will always be true.\"\n\nA hush fell upon the jail as the singer wailed forth his sad lament,\nand when the song was ended a murmur ran along the hall. Pecos\nlistened, half in a doze, to the muttered comments; then with a jerk he\nsat up and stared. The man in the next cell had said,\n\n\"That's old Babe, singin' his jag-song. He'll be in here pretty soon.\"\n\nBabe! And he would be in there pretty soon! At that magic word a new\nlife swept through Pecos Dalhart's veins; his drowsiness left him, and\nrousing up from his bunk he struggled forth and washed his face at the\ntap. Time and again he slapped the cool water upon his neck and hair;\nhe drank a last draught of its freshness and paced the length of the\ncorridor, his head bowed as if in thought—but listening above all other\nnoises for the sound of Angy's voice. Bill Todhunter came and glanced\nat him impersonally, as he might gaze at a bronc that was about to be\nbroke, but Pecos made no appeal. He had started out to wreck Boone\nMorgan's jail for him, break up his Kangaroo Court, and establish the\nrevolution, and with Angy's help he would do it, yet. The jail gang\nedged in on him a little closer, dogging his steps as the wolf-pack\nfollows its kill, but at every turn of his shaggy head they slunk away.\nThen at last, just as the clock tolled four, the keys clanked in the\nouter door; Hung Wo slipped in with his coffee-pot and can, and after\nhim came Angevine Thorne, escorted by the deputy.\n\n\"Hello, Babe!\" chimed a chorus from behind the bars. \"Hey, Babe—sing\n'Kansas'! Oh, Babe!\" But Angevine Thorne had no thought for his quondam\nprison mates, he was placing himself on record in a protest against the\nlaw.\n\n\"The Constitution of the United States guarantees to every man a fair\nand speedy trial,\" he declaimed with drunken vehemence, \"but look here\nand see what a mockery you have made the law! Look at these poor men,\ncaged up here yet, waiting for their trial! Is that a fair and speedy\nhearing? Look at me; arrested for no offence; confined without cause;\ncondemned without a hearing; imprisoned for no crime! Is that justice?\nJustice forsooth! It is conspiracy—treachery—crime! Yes, I say _crime_!\nYou are the criminals and we the helpless victims of your hands! I\nappeal to God, if there is a God, to bear witness of my innocence!\nWhat? I must go in? Then throw open your prison doors—I die a martyr to\nthe Cause!\"\n\nThe clanging of the cell doors gave no pause to his impassioned\neloquence, nor yet his sudden injection into jail; but when, as he\nswayed upon his heels, his eyes fell upon the haggard features of Pecos\nDalhart, the apostle of civic equality stopped short and struck his\nbrow with a despairing hand.\n\n\"What!\" he cried. \"Are you here, Cumrad? Then let me die forthwith,\nfor tyranny has done its worst! Pecos Dalhart, immured within prison\nwalls, torn from the fond embrace of his—but hush, I go too far. Pecos,\nold boy, in the years to come your name shall go down to posterity\nas a martyr to the Cause. You have been arrested, sir, for no crime\nin law or fact, but simply for your outspoken opposition to the foul\nconspiracy of capitalism. Oh, that I might stand before the people and\nplead your cause—But enough; how are you, Old Hoss?\"\n\nHe gathered Pecos into his arms and embraced him, and to the\nastonishment of Hung Wo and the prisoners Pecos hugged him to his\nbreast.\n\n\"I'm dam' glad to see you, Angy,\" he murmured, \"and no mistake.\nHere—take this strap and keep them fellers off—I'm dyin' for a sleep.\"\nHe reached back for the floor, slipped gently down and stretched out\nupon the hard concrete. When Angevine Thorne lifted up his head he was\nasleep.\n\n\"Poor old Pecos,\" said Angy, holding out his hands as Mark Antony did\nover Cæsar, \"there he lies, a victim to his country's laws. But sleep,\nold friend, and the first man that disturbs your dreams will feel the\nweight of this!\" He held up the alcalde's strap for emphasis, and a low\nrumble of disapproval went up from the rows of cells.\n\n\"He broke every head in jail last night,\" volunteered the deputy, \"an'\nit's about time he was kangarooed!\"\n\n\"Not while I live!\" declared Angy tragically. \"Right or wrong, the\nfirst man that lays hands on this poor corse will fight it out with me!\"\n\nA chorus of defiance and derision was his only answer, but Angevine\nThorne, being a natural-born orator, knew better than to reiterate\nhis remarks for emphasis. He balanced the big strap in his hand as\na warrior might test his sword, and squatted down to eat. While the\ndinner hour lasted he was safe—after that he would feel his way. So\nhe put his back to the bars and began to take a little nourishment,\ngnashing belligerently at his hunk of meat and fortifying himself\nwith coffee—but that was not to be the limit of his fare. As he\nscuttled back and forth with the prison plates, Hung Wo had kept an\nattentive eye upon the prostrate form of his boss and, seeing no\nsigns of returning animation, had looked worried. At last, as Angy's\nprotectorate became evident, he returned to his copper can and produced\na fine big pie.\n\n\"This for boss,\" he said, and placed it by Pecos's head.\n\n\"All right, Wo,\" responded Angy, \"my friend, he sleep. Bimeby wakum\nup, I give him pie.\" He finished up his plate, glanced at the surly\nfaces behind the bars, and cast a longing look at the fresh-baked pie.\nThere was going to be a ruction, that was sure, and ructions are bad\nfor pies. He took Pecos by the shoulder and shook him tentatively; then\nwith a sigh of Christian resignation he reached over and picked up the\npie. \"Dam' shame to go and waste it,\" he muttered, \"an' it's all right,\ntoo.\"\n\nThe prisoners watched him eat his way through the crust and down\nthrough the middle until finally he licked his finger-tips and smiled.\n\n\"Him good pie, Wo,\" he observed, rising to his feet, \"make me hip\nstlong.\" He shoved Pecos back into the corner, took his place before\nhim, and balanced the strap for battle. \"All right, deputy,\" he said,\n\"turn them tarriers loose, and if I don't tan their hides with this\nstrap they ain't no hell no mo'!\"\n\nThe cell doors clanged and flew open, the balked cohorts of the enemy\nstepped forth and gathered about him, and as Angy paced back and forth\nbefore his friend he opened wide the flood-gates of his wrath.\n\n\"See the skulkin' curs and cowards,\" he cried, lashing out at them with\nhis strap, \"see them cringe before the whip like the servile slaves\nthey are. What has this man done that you should fall upon him? Broke\nup your court, hey? Well, what was the court to you? Didn't it punish\nyou whether you were right or wrong? Didn't it tyrannize over you and\nforce you to do its will? Ah, despicable dogs, that would lick the hand\nthat strikes you—come out here, any one of you, and I swear I'll beat\nyou to death. Hah! You are afraid! You are afraid to face an honest\nman and fight him hand to hand! Or is it something else?\" The defiant\ntone left his voice of a sudden and he looked eagerly into their tense\nfaces. \"Or is it something else?\" he cried. \"Friends, you have been\nshut up here for months by that great crime they call the law. You\nknow that law—how it protects the rich and crushes down the poor! What\nthen—do you still worship its outworn forms so that you must suffer\nthem even in jail? Must you still have a sheriff to harass you, a judge\nto condemn you, a district attorney to talk you blind? Must you still\nbe tyrannized over by a false and illegal court, even in the shadow of\nthe jail? God forbid! But what then? Ah, yes; what then! Friends, I\nbring you the Gospel of Equality; I stand before you to proclaim as our\nforebears proclaimed before us, that all men are born free and equal;\nI call upon you, even in this prison, to cast aside the superstition\nof government and proclaim the revolution! To hell with the Kangaroo\nCourt! My friend here has beaten up its officers—let us abolish it\nforever! What? Is it a go? Then here's to the revolution!\"\n\nHe waved his hand above his head, smiling upward at that fair Goddess\nof Liberty whom he discerned among the rods; and the gaping prisoners,\ncarried away by his eloquence, let out a mighty yell of joy. Worn and\njaded by the dull monotony of their life they seized upon the new\nreligion with undiscriminating zest, passing up the big words and the\nmoonshine and rejoicing in their noble freedom from restraint. As the\nfirst symptoms of a jail-riot began to develop Boone Morgan and his\ndeputies rushed out to quell the disturbance, but the revolution gave\nno promise of a rough-house. As was to be expected, the prostrate\nform of Pecos Dalhart was draped across the foreground—and served him\nright, for trying to get too gay—but the other figures were not in good\nsupport. Angevine Thorne stood above the body of his friend, waving\nthe alcalde's strap, but the Roman mob was sadly out of part. It was\ndancing around the room singing \"Kansas.\"\n\n    \"I'll tell you what they do—_in Kansas_,\"\n\nthey howled.\n\n    \"I'll tell you what they do—_in Kansas_,\"\n\nand at the end of each refrain Angy lifted up his vibrant tenor and\nadded yet another chapter to the shameless tale. It was a bacchanalia\nof song, perhaps; or a saturnalia of inter-State revilings; but none\nof the onlookers recognized in the progressive dirtiness of the words\na spirit of protest against the law. The revolution had come, but\nlike many another promising child it was too young to be clearly\ndifferentiated from its twin brothers, License and Liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBACK TO NATURE\n\n\nAs to what the revolution is or is to be there are no two authorities\nwho agree. It is not a thing, to be measured and defined; nay, it is\na dream which, like our ideas of heaven, varies with individuals.\nTo the philosopher it is an earthly realization of all our heavenly\naspirations; to the low-browed man-of-hands something less, since his\naspirations are less, but still good to cure all social ills. When\nPecos Dalhart entered the Geronimo County jail he turned it into his\nown idea of the revolution—a fighting man's paradise, like the Valhalla\nof the ancients, where the heroes fought all day and were made good as\nnew over night; but when he woke up from his long sleep, behold, Angy\nhad established a philosophical revolution in its stead! At first he\nwas so glad to wake up at all that he did not inspect the new social\nstructure too closely—it had saved him from a terrible beating, that\nwas sure—but as the day wore on and a gang of yeggs began to ramp about\nhe shook his head and frowned.\n\n\"Say, Angy,\" he said, \"what did you tell them fellers last night to\nmake 'em take on like this?\"\n\n\"Told 'em the same old story, Cumrad—how the monopolistic classes has\ncombined with the hell hounds of the law to grind us pore men down.\nAin't it glorious how the glad news has touched their hearts? Even\nwithin the walls of our prison they are happy!\"\n\n\"Umph!\" grunted Pecos, and scowled up at a tall Mexican who had\nventured to call him _compadre_. \"What's all this _compañero_ talk\nthat's goin' on amongst the Mexicans—are they in on the deal, too?\"\n\n\"Surest thing!\" responded Angy warmly.\n\n\"Huh!\" said Pecos, \"I hope they don't try no _buen' amigo_ racket on\nme—I was raised to regard Mexicans like horny toads.\"\n\n\"All men is brothers—that's my motto. And they's good Mexicans, too,\nremember that. Just think of Joe Garcia!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" rejoined Pecos, with heat, \"_think_ of 'im! If it wasn't for\nthat saddle-colored dastard I'd be free, 'stead of rottin' in this\nhole. I says to the judge: 'I bought that cow and calf off of Joe\nGarcia—there he is, standin' over there—I summon him for a witness.'\n'Is that your calf?' says the judge. 'Kin savvy,' he says, humpin' up\nhis back. 'Did you sell him to this man?' '_Yo no se!_' says Joe, and\nhe kept it up with his 'No savvys' and his 'I don't knows' until the\ndam' judge throwed me into jail. Sure! I'm stuck on Mexicans! I'll\nbrother 'em, all right, if they come around me—I'll brother 'em over\nthe head with a club!\"\n\n\"Jest the same, it was Mexicans that saved your bacon last night,\"\nretorted Angy, with spirit. \"Some of these white men that you had beat\nup were for pushin' your face in while you was asleep, but when I made\na little talk in Spanish, touchin' on your friendly relations with the\nGarcia family, the Mexicans came over in a body and took your part.\nThat was pretty good, hey?\"\n\n\"Um,\" responded Pecos, but he assented without enthusiasm. Barring\nthe one exception which went to prove the rule, he had never had much\nuse for Mexicans—and Marcelina was a happy accident, not to be looked\nfor elsewhere in the Spanish-American world. Still, a man had to have\n_some_ friends; and a Mex was better than a yegg, anyhow. He looked\naround until he found the tall man who had called him _compadre_ and\nbeckoned him with an imperious jerk of the head. The Mexican came over\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"You speak English?\" inquired Pecos. \"That's good—I want to tell you\nsomething. My friend here says you and your _compadres_ stood up for me\nlast night when I was down and out—hey? Well, that's all right—I'm a\nTexano and I ain't got much use for Mexicanos in general, but any time\nyou boys git into trouble with them yeggs, jest call on me! Savvy?\"\n\nThe tall man savvied and though Pecos still regarded them with disfavor\nthe Mexican contingency persisted in doing him homage—only now they\nreferred to him as _El Patrón_. _Patrón_ he was, and Boss, though he\nnever raised a hand. Interpreting aright his censorious glances the\nsons of Mexico confined their celebration of the Dawn of Freedom to\na carnival of neglect, lying in their bunks and smoking _cigarritos_\nwhile the filth accumulated in the slop cans. Under the iron rule of\nPete Monat they had been required to do all the cleaning up—for in\nArizona a Mexican gets the dirty end of everything—but no sooner had\nBabe sung his clarion call for freedom than they joined him, heart and\nhand. If the Society of the Revolution was at all related to the Sons\nof Rest they wanted to go down as charter members—and they did.\n\nThe time may come when cleanliness will be an inherited instinct\nbut at present most of the cleaning up in the world is done under\ncompulsion. Parents compel their children to wash and change their\nclothes; employers compel their wage-slaves to scrub and clean and\nempty; cities compel their householders to dispose of sewage and\ngarbage; but not even among members of the capitalistic classes is\nthere shown any clean-cut desire to do the work themselves. The Arizona\nIndians escape their obligations by moving camp at intervals, and God's\nsunshine helps out the settlers; but in the Geronimo jail there was no\nsunshine, nor could any Indian break camp. They were shut in, and there\nthey had to lie, three deep, until the judge should decide their fate.\nFor two days they had luxuriated in anarchy, philosophical and real,\nbut neither kind emptied any garbage. The jail was the dwelling place\nof Freedom, but it smelled bad. That was a fact. Even the Mexicans\nnoticed it, but they did not take it to heart. It was only when Boone\nMorgan came down for a batch of prisoners that the community got its\norders to clean up.\n\nThese were busy days with Boone—opening court, arraigning prisoners,\nsummoning witnesses, roping in jurymen, speaking a good word for some\npoor devil in the tanks—and it kept him on the run from sun-up to dark.\nHe knew that Pecos Dalhart had broken up his Kangaroo Court and that\nAngevine Thorne had pulled off some kind of a tin-horn revolution on\nhim, but he didn't mind a little thing like that. Jail life had its\nups and downs, but so long as the cage was tight the birds could do as\nthey pleased—short of raising a riot. At least, that was Boone Morgan's\ntheory, based on the general proposition that he could stand it as\nlong as they could—but when at the end of the second day he caught a\nwhiff of the sublimated jail-smell that rose from the abiding place of\nliberty he let out a \"whoosh\" like a bear.\n\n\"Holy Moses, Bill,\" he cried, \"make these rascals clean up! M-mmm!\nThat would drive a dog out of a tan-yard! What's the matter—is somebody\ndead?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" responded Bill Todhunter, \"but they will be, if we don't git\nsome trusty in there. Them fellers won't do _nuthin'_—an' I can't go in\nthere and make 'em! You better appoint another alcalde.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with Pete?\"\n\n\"His head is too sore—he won't be able to put up a fight for a month.\"\n\n\"Umm, and Mike is fixed worse yet—where's that crazy cowman, Pecos\nDalhart?\"\n\nThey found Pecos comfortably bestowed in the bunk of the end cell,\nphilosophically smoking jail tobacco as a deodorizer.\n\n\"Say,\" said the sheriff, brusquely addressing him through the bars,\n\"things are gittin' pretty rotten around here—somebody ought to make\nthem Mexicans clean up. You put my Kangaroo Court out of business—how'd\nyou like the job yourself?\"\n\nPecos grunted contemptuously.\n\n\"Don't want it, hey? Well, you don't have to have it—I can get that big\nsheep-man down from the upper tanks.\"\n\nA cold glint came into Pecos Dalhart's eyes, but he made no remarks—a\nbig sheep-man would just about fall in with his mood.\n\n\"I got to have some kind of a trusty,\" observed Morgan, but as Pecos\ndid not rise to the bait, he passed down the run-around grumbling.\n\n\"He's a sulky brute,\" said Bill Todhunter, as they retreated from the\nstench, \"better leave him alone a while and see if we can't stink him\nout.\"\n\n\"Well, you order them Mexicans to clean up,\" rumbled the sheriff, \"and\nif this here Pecos Dalhart makes any more trouble I'll see that he gits\nroped and hog-tied. And say, throw old Babe out of there as soon as he\ngits his supper. Them two fellers are side-kickers in this business\nand we got to bust 'em up. It's a good thing the grand jury ain't in\nsession now—I'd git hell for the condition of that jail.\"\n\nThere never was a jail so clean it didn't smell bad, but that night\nthe Geronimo jail broke into the same class with the Black Hole\nof Calcutta, yet the inmates seemed to enjoy it. The yegg gang in\nparticular—a choice assortment of Chi Kids, Denver Slims, and Philly\nBlacks who had fled from the Eastern winter—were having the time of\ntheir lives, rampaging up and down the corridor, upsetting cuspidors,\nthrowing water from the wash-room, and making themselves strictly at\nhome. When the sturdy form of Pecos Dalhart appeared in the door of\nCell One they slackened their pace a little, but now that the moral\nrestraint of Babe was gone they felt free as the prairie wind. Only in\ntheir avoidance of Mexicans did they show a certain consciousness of\nauthority, for the word had passed that Pecos was _buen' amigo_ with\nthe _umbres_ and no one was looking for a rough-house. As for Pecos,\nhe put in his time thinking, standing aloof from friends and enemies\nalike—and his thoughts were of the revolution. When he had been off\nby himself reading the _Voice of Reason_ he had been astounded at the\nblank stupidity of the common people, which alone was holding mankind\nback from its obvious destiny. \"Think, Slave, think!\" it used to say;\nand thinking was so easy for him. But the blind and brutish wage slaves\nwho were dragged at the chariot wheels of capitalism—well, perhaps they\nhad not yet learned how. Anyway, he had seen how inevitable was the\nrevolution, and whichever way he turned he saw new evidences of that\nbase conspiracy between wealth and government which keeps the poor man\ndown. Nay, he had not only seen it—he had suffered at its hand. Yet\nthere was one thing which he had never realized before, though the\n_Voice of Reason_ was full of it—the low and churlish spirit of the\nmasses which incapacitated them for freedom. Take those yeggs, now.\nThey had been freed from the hard and oppressive hand of tyranny and\nyet as soon as the Kangaroo Court was abolished they began to raise\nparticular hell. It was discouraging. There was only one way to beat\nsense into some people, and that was with a club. A cuspidor came the\nlength of the corridor and Pecos rose slowly from his couch. What was\nthe use of trying the revolution on a gang of narrow-headed yeggs!\n\n\"Hey,\" he challenged, \"you yaps want to key down a little or I'll\nrattle your heads together. Go on into your cells now, and shut up.\"\nHe fixed the yegg-men sternly with his eye, but the blood had gone to\ntheir heads from gambolling about and they still had their dreams of\nheaven.\n\n\"Aw, gwan,\" said Philly Black, \"we ain't doin' nawthin'—give a feller a\nshow, can't ye?\"\n\n\"W'y, sure, I'll give you a show!\" thundered Pecos wrathfully. \"You\nyeggs think because I licked Pete Monat I give you license to prize up\nhell. You got this jail like a hog-waller already in two days. Now,\nclean up, you dastards, and the first man that opens his face to me\nwill go to the doctor!\"\n\nThere was no easy answer to an argument like that and the gang slouched\nsullenly to their task, making all the motions of a superficial\ncleaning up but leaving the jail dirtier than ever. With his strap\npoised Pecos stood over them, reading well the insubordination in\ntheir black hearts and waiting only for some one to start the fray. At\nevery move the yeggs became viler and more slipshod in their methods,\nspilling half the contents of every can upon the floor, and still Pecos\nDalhart eyed them grimly, while the awe-stricken Mexicans huddled\ntogether in their cells waiting for the catastrophe. At last Philly\nBlack, emboldened by his immunity, was moved to take a chance. Seizing\nrecklessly upon the nearest can he made a rush for the wash-room,\nslopping filth and corruption as he went. As he passed Pecos his hold\nslipped, accidentally, of course, and the can fell to the floor with\na final overflowing of uncleanness.\n\n\"Clean that up,\" Pecos said, as Philly Black came to a crouch, but\nPhilly only looked over his shoulder. \"Clean that up!\" commanded Pecos,\ndrawing nearer. \"_Clean_—\" but Philly was cleaning up. His gang had not\nrallied to his aid. Slowly and slovenly, and making ugly faces, he bent\nto his unwilling task, scowling beneath his black mop of hair at Denver\nand Chi and the gang.\n\n\"I said _clean up_!\" rumbled Pecos, as Philly grabbed his can to go.\n\"_Clean up!_ You don't call that clean, do you?\"\n\n\"Aw, go t'hell!\" bellowed Philly Black, hurling his slop-can once more\nupon the floor. \"Let the dam' Mexicans clean up!\"\n\nHe dodged the swift swing of the strap and leapt in, calling on his\nfellows for aid. For a moment they wrestled furiously, and as the yeggs\nrushed in to help, the Mexicans swarmed out to meet them; but before\neither side could lend a hand Philly Black slipped on his own dirty\nfloor and went down with a deadly thud. Pecos rode him to the floor,\nclutching fiercely at his throat; for an instant he waited for him to\nfight back, then he sprang up and waded into the yeggs. Philly was\nwhere he would make no trouble for quite a while.\n\nOnce more at the clamor of battle the jail deputies came rushing to the\nrescue, bending their futile pistols upon the yelling prisoners.\n\n\"It's that blankety-blank, Pecos Dalhart!\" shouted Bill Todhunter as he\ngoggled through the bars. \"Well, the son of a goat, ain't he a fightin'\nfool!\" There was a note almost of admiration in his voice, for Pecos\nwas punching heads and belting yeggs with the calculating rage of a\nconqueror.\n\n\"Git out of my way, _umbres_!\" he yelled to his Mexican retainers.\n\"_Vaya se—vamos_—I can fix 'em!\" And he surely did. In his strong\nhands the alcalde's strap was a deadly weapon; he swung it with a\npuncher's skill and laid it on like a horse-wrangler. Shrieks for\nmercy were mingled with howls of pain and every time a man stood up to\nhim he slugged him with all his strength. The floor was strewn with\nyeggs and when he had beaten down all opposition he flogged them into\ntheir cells.\n\n[Illustration: \"You _will_ turn this jail into a hog-waller, will you?\"\nhe demanded]\n\n\"You _will_ turn this jail into a hog-waller, will you?\" he demanded,\nwhen the corridor was cleared of men. \"You _will_ throw slops on the\nfloor and not half clean 'em up! Well, come outer there, you low-browed\nhobos—_I'll_ show you how it's done! Now take them swabs and fill your\ncans with water and wash this floor up right. No, you stay where you\nare, _umbres_; I want to show these brake-beam tourists who's the boss.\n_Jump_ now, you panhandlers, or I'll burn you up with this!\" He swung\nhis wet strap and popped it behind the Chi Kid, and Chi went on his\nway. Bill Todhunter and the jail deputy looked curiously on through\nthe bars; the reporter for the morning _Blade_ showed up suddenly\nfrom nowhere and began to ask leading questions, but Pecos did not\nunbend. In vain the reporter tried to beckon him up to the bars—Pecos\nremembered him too well as the fresh young man who had made a jest\nof his breaking into jail; also he hoped he could do a little job of\nhouse-cleaning without going on record as the friend of old Boone\nMorgan. He might be a little weak on the revolution but he knew his\nnatural enemies. These were the men who had thrown him into jail for\nbranding his own cow's calf; they were the hirelings of the System,\nfriends to the rich and enemies to the poor; to them the agony of his\nsoul was no more than a passing jest. He turned on the reporter and\nscowled.\n\n\"Go take a run and jump at yourself!\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE POWER OF THE PRESS\n\n\nThe power of a venal and subsidized press in moulding public opinion is\na thing that can hardly be overstated, even by the _Voice of Reason_.\nWhen Pecos Dalhart told the willowy young man from the _Blade_ to take\na running jump at himself he expressed as in no other way his absolute\ncontempt for society. Young Mr. Baker of the Geronimo _Blade_ had the\ncigarette habit, he drank whiskey, and his private life would not\nbear too close inspection—he was hardly the man that one would choose\nas a censor of public character—and yet he held the job. When Pecos\nhad broken up Boone Morgan's Kangaroo Court and spoiled the clever\nlittle court-house skit that Mr. Baker had framed up in his mind, that\nunprincipled young man had alluded to him, briefly and contemptuously,\nas a bad _hombre_ from the Verde country, a desperate fellow, etc., and\nhad ended by saying that Sheriff Morgan, who was convinced that he had\na dangerous criminal on his hands, was looking up his record in Texas.\nThat was a lovely introduction for a man who was held for the grand\njury—it reached the eye of nearly every qualified juror in the county\nand was equivalent to about seven years in Yuma. If Mr. Baker had been\nhuman this last admonition about the running jump would have raised\nit to fourteen years, but they were short of copy that day and Baker\nwas only a reporter, so he sharpened up his pencil and wrote a little\njolly, just to keep Boone Morgan in good humor.\n\n     JAIL STRIKE A FAILURE\n\n     \"Mr. Pecos Q. Dalhart, who signalized his incarceration in the\n     county jail by breaking up the prisoners' court, sending the Hon.\n     Pete Monat and Michael Slattery to the hospital, and beating\n     up the defenceless inmates with a chair, pulled off another\n     little _soirée_ last night, though for a different cause. It\n     appears that when Mr. Dalhart registered at the Hotel de Morgan\n     he had been reading a certain incendiary sheet which panders\n     to the unreasoning prejudice of the ignorant by a general rave\n     against the established order of things. With his mind inflamed\n     by this organ of anarchy Mr. Dalhart conceived the original and\n     ambitious idea of destroying the last vestige of law, order, and\n     government within the walls of his prison, and Sheriff Morgan,\n     being of a tolerant disposition, decided to let him try it on and\n     see how he enjoyed the results. Not every public officer would\n     have had the courage to permit such a firebrand to carry on his\n     propaganda unhindered, but Boone Morgan has merited the confidence\n     of every citizen of Geronimo County by his fearless handling\n     of the desperate men entrusted to his care, and the outcome of\n     this episode is a case in point. Only three days were needed to\n     convince the bad man from Verde Crossing of the error of his way.\n     His first outbreak was to destroy all law and order—his second was\n     to enforce the sanitary regulations of the prison. By his sudden\n     and decided stand for cleanliness Mr. Dalhart has shown that he\n     possesses the capacity for better things, even if he did make a\n     slight mistake in regard to Isaac Crittenden's spotted calf. The\n     scrap was a jim-dandy, while it lasted, but the issue was never in\n     doubt, for the Verde terror is a whirlwind when he gets started.\n     There have been house-cleanings galore in the past, but never\n     within the memory of man has the Geronimo jail received such a\n     washing and scrubbing as was administered when Dalhart rose up in\n     his wrath and put down the very strike which he had organized;\n     and while the sheriff cannot but deprecate his tendency to resort\n     to violence there is no gainsaying the fact that in this case his\n     motives were of the best. Stay with it, Pecos, you may be alcalde\n     yet!\"\n\nPecos Dalhart was sitting in lonely state, eating the fresh-baked pie\nwhich Hung Wo conferred upon him as the Boss, when Bill Todhunter\nshoved a copy of the Geronimo _Blade_ through the bars.\n\n\"See you got yore name in the paper,\" he observed, but Pecos only\ngrunted. Curiosity is an attribute of the child—and besides, he was\nmore interested in his pie. It had always been an ambition of his\nto have pie three times a day, and the steady round of beef, bread,\nand coffee incidental to life on the range had made that hope seem a\ndream dear enough almost to justify matrimony. At least, he had never\nexpected to attain to it any other way; but Hung Wo was a good cook,\nwhen he wanted to be. To serve two prison meals a day for fourteen\ncents and a profit meant pretty close figuring, and the patrons of\nHung Wo's downtown restaurant needed to have no compunctions about\nleaving a part of their bounteous dinner untouched—the guests of the\nHotel de Morgan were not supposed to be superstitious about eating\n\"come-backs.\" It would be a poor Chinaman who could not feed you on ten\ncents a day, if you didn't care what you ate. But Pecos cared, and he\ncast a glance that was almost benevolent upon his faithful pie-maker as\nhe tucked the _Blade_ into his shirt.\n\n\"That's good pie, Charley,\" he said approvingly. \"Some day when you\nketchum big hurry I make him boy wash dishes.\"\n\n\"Allite,\" responded Hung Wo, \"you likee kek?\"\n\n\"Sure thing! You savvey makum cake?\"\n\n\"Me makum kek, pie, cha'lotte lusse, custa'd, plenty mo'!\" declaimed\nCharley, with pride.\n\n\"Sure! I know you! You keep big restaurant—down by Turf Saloon, hey? I\neat there, one time—heap good!\"\n\n\"You tlink so?\" beamed the child-like Oriental. \"Allite, next time me\nbingum kek!\" He gathered up the tin pannikins and departed, radiant,\nwhile Pecos crouched peacefully on his heels against the corridor bars.\n\n\"Say, they's a piece about you in that paper,\" volunteered Todhunter,\nas he jerked open the cell doors, \"that young feller that was here last\nnight wrote it up.\"\n\n\"Aw, to hell with 'im,\" growled Pecos scornfully; but at the same time\nhe was interested. Life within prison walls is not very exciting—there\nis lots of company, but not of the best, and any man who does not want\nto hear dirty stories or learn how \"mooching\" and \"scoffing\" is done,\nor the details of the jungle life, is likely in time to become lonely.\nAlready he was hungry for the outdoor life—the beating of the hot sun,\nthe tug of the wind, the feel of the saddle between his knees—but alas,\nhe was doomed to spend his unprofitable days in jail, a burden to\nhimself and society! Six months in jail, before he could come before\nthe grand jury and have his trial—six months, and it had not yet been\nsix days. He drew the morning _Blade_ from his bosom and examined\nit carefully, searching vainly through editorial columns and patent\ninsides until at last he caught the heading: \"Jail Strike a Failure.\nBad Man from Verde Crossing Makes Prisoners Clean Up.\" Then he read\nthe article through carefully, mumbling over the big words in the hope\nof sensing their meaning and lingering long over his name in print. At\nthe allusion to the _Voice of Reason_ he flushed hot with indignation;\nmuttered curses greeted the name of Sheriff Morgan; but every time he\ncame to \"Mr. Dalhart\" he smiled weakly and nursed his young mustache.\nBut after he had finished he went back and gazed long and intently at\nhis full name as given at the beginning:—\"Mr. Pecos Q. Dalhart\"—Pecos\nQ.! He read the entire paper over carefully and came back to it again;\nand that evening, when Mr. Baker of the _Blade_ strolled in, he\nbeckoned him sternly to the bars.\n\n\"Say,\" he said, \"what the hell you mean by puttin' that 'Q.' in my\nname—Pecos Q. Dalhart? My name is Pecos straight—named after that river\nin Texas!\"\n\n\"Oh, is it?\" cried the young reporter, making a hurried note. \"Well,\nI beg your pardon, Mr. Dalhart, I'm sure. How's house-cleaning to-day?\nOrganized your court yet? No? Well, when you do, let me know. Always\nlike to be present, you understand, when you have a trial.\" He hurried\naway, as if upon important business, and slowed down as suddenly before\nthe sheriff's office.\n\n\"That 'Q.' did the business,\" he observed, glancing triumphantly at the\nassembled company. \"I told you I'd make that rustler talk. A man may\nnot give a dam' what you say about him but he goes crazy if you get\nhis name wrong—I found that out long ago. Mr. Dalhart informs me that\nhis name is Pecos straight—no 'Q.' in it. Pecos Straight Dalhart! All\nright, I'll try to get it right next time. What'll you bet we don't\nhave another Kangaroo Court before the end of the week?\"\n\n\"The cigars,\" replied Boone Morgan casually. As a politician, cigars\nwere a matter of small import to him—when he was not giving them away\nhis friends were giving cigars to him.\n\n\"I'll go you!\" cried Baker enthusiastically, \"and the drinks, too. You\nbetter turn Mr. Dalhart over to me for a while and watch me make a man\nout of him. All I ask is that you give him the morning _Blade_.\"\n\n\"All right,\" assented Bill Todhunter, from the corner; and the next\nmorning Pecos received it with his breakfast. Charley Hung Wo had\nprovided him with an unusually tempting apple roll that morning but it\nwas neglected for the moment while he ran over the Court House Briefs.\nHe searched the whole page carefully, but there was no mention of Pecos\nDalhart, either with or without the \"Q.\" He pondered upon the fact\nduring the day—having nothing else to do—and when the Friday paper\ncame out with nothing about the Hotel de Morgan in it he considered\nthe matter seriously. Then it came over him gradually—there was\nnothing mysterious about it—the reporter was waiting for something\nto happen—a kangaroo trial, or something like that. Well, anything for\na little excitement—why not? There were lots of things to be remedied.\nThe yeggs had a dirty way of tapping on the boiler-iron doors and\nsinging lewd songs after they were locked into their cells for the\nnight, a combination which broke in on his sleep; and knowing that they\nwere safe from his strap they persisted in this amusement until they\ncould sing no more, stoutly denying all knowledge of the disturbance in\nthe morning. It was the only revenge they could take on him and they\nworked it to the limit. Not to be outdone in the matter of revenge he\ndrove them like a pack of peons in the morning, forcing them to do all\nthe cleaning while his Mexican friends rolled _cigarritos_—but that\nwas getting wearisome. Yet how easy it would be to change! The verdict\nof a kangaroo jury is always \"Guilty\"—why not accuse half the yeggs of\ndisturbing the peace, appoint the jury from the other half, and let\nyegg nature do the rest? Then sentence the prisoners at the bar to\nclean up for a week. Why not, indeed!\n\nAt supper time Pecos spoke a few invitational words through the bars to\nBill Todhunter and about the time the boy reporter from the _Blade_ was\ndue he placed his chair against the doors and called his court to order.\n\n\"_Oyez! Oyez!_ The Kangaroo Court of Geronimo is now in session!\" he\nannounced, in stentorian tones, and instantly the prisoners began to\nassemble. \"_Oyez_\" was good Spanish for \"Hear!\" and brought out all the\nMexicans; and the Americans came on the run, eager for any excitement\nto pass the time away.\n\n\"Blacky,\" said Pecos, addressing the one-time king of the yeggs, \"bring\nthe Chi Kid before the bar of justice. He is accused of disturbing the\npeace by singin' songs all night.\"\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation Philly Black laid violent hands upon his\nfriend and cellmate and dragged him before the court. The mandates of\nthe law are inexorable; and besides, Philly wanted the job of sheriff.\n\n\"Come up here, Chi,\" he swaggered, fetching Chi Kid around with a jerk,\n\"now stand there, or I'll punch youse in the jaw!\" Chi stood, reading\nhis fate in every eye.\n\n\"Now, summon me a couple of witnesses!\" commanded Pecos, and as Blacky\nsifted through the crowd looking for a pair of men who could stand the\nKid off later, Boone Morgan and the boy reporter arrived from the outer\noffice and stood by to see the fun.\n\n\"Chi Kid,\" declaimed the judge, \"you are accused of singin' dirty songs\nall night and disturbin' of the peace. Do you plead guilty or not\nguilty?\"\n\n\"Not guilty!\" responded Chi, rolling his evil eyes on the witnesses.\n\n\"Bring up them witnesses!\" said Pecos briefly. \"Slim, did you hear the\naccused singing' them dirty songs of his last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, Yer Honor!\" answered Denver Slim dutifully, \"and I couldn't\nhardly sleep—Yer Honor!\"\n\n\"Urr—it's too bad about you,\" commented the alcalde. \"Bring up that\nother witness!\" The other witness had suffered a similar insomnia.\n\"That's all!\" announced Pecos, with finality, \"got to hurry this case\nthrough now. Got anything to say for yourse'f, prisoner?\"\n\n\"I demand a jury trial!\" growled the Kid.\n\n\"Too late for that now—the defendant is found guilty and sentenced to\nclean up for a week or git forty blows with the strap. Sheriff, bring\nme Denver Slim!\"\n\nThere was a genuine commotion at this, but Philly Black produced the\naccused—he had to, or lose his job.\n\n\"Denver Slim, you are accused of hammerin' on your door all night and\ndisturbin' of the peace. Do you plead guilty or not guilty?\"\n\nDenver turned and made three successive jabs at the jail sheriff, who\nhad ruffled his feelings from behind; then he drew himself up and\nremarked:\n\n\"I don't plead!\"\n\n\"'Don't plead' is the same as 'Not guilty,'\" said Pecos, remembering\nhis experience with Pete Monat, \"and more than that,\" he thundered,\n\"it's the same as contempt of court! Mr. Sheriff, spread-eagle the\nprisoner over a chair while I give him ten good ones for contempt—the\ntrial will then proceed!\" He rose from his chair and approached the\ndefendant warily, hefting his strap as he came, and Denver became so\ndeeply engrossed in his movements that Philly Black closed with him\nfrom the rear. There was a struggle, gazed upon judicially by the\nalcalde, and at last with a man on every arm and leg Denver was laid\nsprawling over the back of the chair while the prisoners gibbered\nwith delight. The blows were laid on soundly and yet with a merciful\nindulgence and when the humiliating ceremony was over Pecos had won\nevery heart but one. Denver Slim was sore, of course; but how are you\nto have a Roman holiday unless somebody else gets hurt? They had a long\nand protracted jury trial after this, with a fiery denunciation of\nlaw-breakers by John Doe, the district attorney; and the verdict, of\ncourse, was \"Guilty.\" Then they kangarooed a few Mexicans to clean up\ntheir side of the house and ended with a jubilee chorus of \"Kansas.\"\n\n     \"I'll tell you what they do—_in Kansas_!\"\n\nIt was great. There was a piece about it in the paper the next morning\nand prospective grand jurymen slapped their legs and remarked, one to\nthe other: \"That Pecos Dalhart is a proper fighting fool, ain't he? I\nreckon Old Crit just jumped him into that racket up the river in order\nto git him out of the country. It's a dam' shame, too, when you think\nhow many Crit has stole!\"\n\nBut alas, neither public praise nor blame could open up the bars and\nlet Pecos out of jail. He was held by a power higher than any man—the\npower of the Law, which, because it has endured so long and is, in\nfact, all we have, is deemed for that reason sacred. And the law was\nbusy—it is always busy—and behind. Well, Pecos didn't know much about\nit, except what he had read in the _Voice of Reason_, but as he heard\nthe ponderous wheels of the law grinding about him, saw yeggs escape by\ncleverly devised tales and Mexicans soaked because they were slow and\ndumb, he wondered if that was the only way they could make a stagger at\njustice. A drunken cowboy had seized a gay man-about-town and taken his\npen-knife from his pocket—grand larceny of the person, he was sentenced\nto seven years. Another drunken reprobate had beaten up the roustabout\nin a saloon—and got thirty days for assault and battery. Both drunk\nand both bad, but one had played to hard luck. He had taken property,\nthe other had hurt a man. Pecos saw when it was too late where he had\nmarred his game—he should have beaten Old Crit instead of branding his\ncalf.\n\nIn sombre silence he listened day by day as the jail-lawyers—wise\ncriminals who had been in the toils before—cooked up stories to explain\naway misdeeds; he watched day by day as the prisoners came down from\ntheir trial, some with bowed heads or cursing blindly, others laughing\nhysterically as they scuttled out the door; and many a man who had\nsworn to a lie went free where simple-minded sinners plead guilty and\ntook their fate. Some there were who had boggled their stories because\ntheir dull minds could not compass the deceit; the district attorney\nhad torn them to flinders, raging and threatening them with his finger\nfor the perjured fools they were, and the judge had given them the\nlimit for swearing to a lie. Even in jail it was the poor and lowly who\nwere punished, while the jail-lawyers and those who could afford the\npetty dollar that hired them took shelter behind the law. Yes, it was\nall a game, and the best man won—if he held the cards.\n\nSlowly and with painstaking care Pecos went over his own case,\ncomparing it with these others, and his heart sank as he saw where the\nodds lay. The spotted calf was his—he could swear to it—but it bore\nthe brand of Crittenden and he had lost his bill of sale. There were\nforty two-gun cowboys working for Crit and any one of them would swear\nhim into jail for a drink—they had done it, so he knew. José Garcia\nwas afraid to tell the truth and Crittenden would scare him worse than\never before the trial took place. Ah, that trial—it was more than five\nmonths off yet and he could not stir a foot! Once outside the bars\nand free-footed he could shake up the dust; he could rustle up his\nwitnesses and his evidence and fight on an equality with Crit. But no,\nthe munneypullistic classes had a bigger pull on him than ever, now—he\nwas jailed in default of bail and no one would put up the price. God,\nwhat an injustice! A rich man—a man with a single friend who could put\nup a thousand dollars' bail—_he_ could go free, to hire his lawyers,\nlook up his witnesses, and fight his case in the open; but a poor\nman—he must lay his condemned carcass in jail and keep it there while\nthe law went on its way. Day by day now the prisoners went to Yuma\nto serve their time, or passed out into the world. But were those who\npassed out innocent? The law said so, for it set them free. And yet\nthey were white with the deadly pallor of the prison, their hands were\nweak from inactivity, and their minds poisoned by the vile company of\nyeggs; they had lain there in the heat all summer while judges went to\nthe coast and grand jurymen harvested their hay, and after all their\nsuffering, as a last and crowning flaunt, the law had declared them\ninnocent! It had been many days since Pecos had seen the _Voice of\nReason_ and he had lost his first enthusiasm for the revolution, but\nnothing could make him think that this was right. The Law was like\nhis kangaroo court, that travesty which he made more villainous in\norder to show his scorn; it laid hold upon the innocent and guilty and\npunished them alike. Only the sturdy fighters, like him, escaped—or the\nprisoners who had their dollar. That was it—money! And Pecos Dalhart\nhad always been poor.\n\nAs the mills of the gods ground on, Pete Monat, with his bandaged\nhead, and Mike Slattery, still nursing his battered jaw, were removed\nfrom the bridal chamber, tried, and lodged in the tanks for safety.\nPete had hired a shyster lawyer and got ten years in Yuma; Mike had\nplead his own case and escaped with only three. It was this last\nlesson that Pecos conned in his heart. When Slattery the yegg was\narrested he had feigned an overpowering drunkenness, and though the\ncase was all against him—he had been caught in the act of burglarizing\na lodging-house and was loaded down with loot—he had nevertheless\nframed up a good defence. With the artless innocence of the skilled\n\"moocher\" he explained to the court that while under the influence of\nno less than seven drinks of straight alcohol he had mistaken another\ngentleman's room for his own and had gathered up his wardrobe under\nthe misapprehension that it was his own. At every attempt to prove his\nculpability he had represented that, beyond the main facts, his mind\nwas a complete blank, at the same time giving such a witty description\nof the paralyzing effects of \"Alki\" that even the district attorney\nhad laughed. According to Mike that was the way to get off easy, be\npolite and respectful-like to the judge and jury and jolly up the\nprosecuting attorney—and in this contention the unfortunate experience\nof Pete Monat clearly bore him out. Pete had made the fatal mistake\nof hiring, with two months' back pay, a \"sucking lawyer\" who had so\nantagonized the district attorney that that gentleman had become\nenraged, making such a red-hot speech against the damnable practice of\nhorse-stealing—\"a crime, gentlemen of the jury, which, because it may\nleave the innocent owner of that horse to die of thirst on the desert,\nought by rights to be made a capital offence\"—that poor Pete was found\nguilty and sentenced before he could build up a new defence.\n\n\"Oh, I don't hold nothin' agin you, Pardner,\" he replied, in answer to\nPecos's solicitude for the influence of his battered head, \"the jury\ndidn't cinch me for my looks—it's that dam' narrer-headed jack-lawyer\nthat I got to thank f'r this. He wouldn't let me tell my story, jest\nthe way it was. You know, an' I know, that when a man gits his time on\nthe range the boss is obligated to give him a mount to town. How's a\ncowboy goin' to git his riggin' to town—walk and pack his saddle? Well,\nnow, jest because I give old Sage some back talk and quit him when he\nwas short-handed he told me to walk; an' me, like the dam' fool I was,\nI went out and roped a hoss instead. Then, jest to git even, he had me\narrested for a hoss-thief. But would this pin-head of a lawyer hear to\na straight talk like that? No—he has me plead 'Not guilty' and swear\nI never took the hoss—an' you know the rest. That district attorney\nis a mean devil—he won't let nobody stand against him—you might as\nwell plead 'Guilty' and take the mercy of the court as to try to buck\nagainst him. But whatever you do, Pardner, don't hire no tin-horn\nlawyer—I give ten years of my life to find that out.\" Pete sighed and\nrubbed his rough hands together wearily—it would be long before they\nfelt the rope and the branding iron and the hard usage of honest toil.\nA great pity came over Pecos at the thought of his unhappy lot, and\nhe treated him kindly before the other prisoners; but all the time a\ngreater fear was clutching at his heart. Pete had taken a horse, but\nhe had burned a calf—and Arizona hates a rustler worse than it hates\na horse-thief. For all his strength and spirit, he was caught—caught\nlike a rat in a trap—and as the imminence of his fate came over him he\nlost his leonine bearing and became furtive, like the rest of them.\nOutwardly he was the same, and he ruled the jail with a rod of iron,\nbut at heart he was a true prisoner—cunning, cringing, watchful,\ndangerous—all his faculties centred upon that one thought, to escape!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE LAW'S DELAY\n\n\nAs the first hot days of summer came on, the district court of Geronimo\nCounty closed; the judge, having decided each case according to the law\nand the evidence, hurried upon his way, well satisfied; the deputies\ntook a last disconsolate batch of prisoners to Yuma, and Pecos Dalhart\nsat down to ponder on his case. The tanks were nearly empty now, except\nfor the drunks and vags that the constables brought in and the grist\nfor the next grand jury. It was a dreary grist, each man swearing his\ninnocence with unnatural warmth until the general cynicism of the place\nshamed him to silence. Pecos loathed them, the whining, browbeaten\nslaves. After he had sounded the depths of human depravity until there\nwas no more wickedness to learn he drew more and more aloof from his\ncompanions, thinking his own thoughts in silence. When Boone Morgan\ncame in, or the _Blade_ reporter, he conversed with them, quietly and\nrespectfully—Boone Morgan could speak a word to the judge, and Baker\nheld the ear of the great public. They were very kind to Pecos now,\nand often, after some ingenious write-up of his exploits, crowds of\nvisitors would come to stare at the grim rustler who ruled the Kangaroo\nCourt. There were no signs of the social theorist about him now, and\nthe revolution was a broken dream—he could not afford such dreams. Let\nthe rich and the free hold fast to their convictions and their faith—he\nwas trying to get out of jail.\n\nThe heat of midsummer came on apace, and the sun, beating against\nthe outer walls, turned the close prison into an oven by day and a\nblack hole of misery at night. The palpitating air seemed to press\nupon them, killing the thought of sleep, and the prisoners moaned\nand tossed in their bunks, or fell into fitful slumbers, broken by\nthe high insistent whine of mosquitoes or the curses of the vags. Of\ncurses there were a plenty before the cool weather came, and protests\nand complaints, but none from Pecos Dalhart. In the long watches of\nthe night he possessed his soul of a mighty patience, to endure all\nthings, if he could only go free. Even with a jail missionary, who\ndistributed tracts and spoke bodingly of a great punishment to come, he\nwas patient; and the missionary, poor simple man that he was, proffered\nhim in return the consolation of religion. Being of a stiffnecked\nand perverse generation Pecos declined to confess his sins—the\nmissionary might be subpœnaed by the prosecution—but he listened with\nlong-suffering calm to the Prodigal Son, the Good Samaritan, and the\nparable of the seeds that were sown on stony ground. In themselves the\nstories were good—nor were they strange to Pecos, for his mother had\nbeen a good Methodist—but the preacher spoiled them by a too pointed\napplication of the moral to his own unfortunate case. Still, he let\nit go—anything was better than listening to the yeggs—and waited for\nthe sermon to end. There was a favor that he wanted to ask. Many years\nago—it was at camp-meeting and the shouters were dancing like mad—he\nhad promised his sainted mother to read the Bible through if she would\nquit agonizing over his soul, but the promise he never kept. Small\nprint was hard on his young eyes that were so quick to see a cow, and\nhe put the matter off until such a time as he should break a leg or get\nsick or otherwise find time to spare. Well, he had all the time there\nwas, now, and it would give him something to do.\n\n\"Say, Pardner,\" he observed, as the missionary pressed a sheaf of\ntracts upon him at parting, \"is this the best you can do? I was\npowerful interested in them stories—how about a Bible?\"\n\nBibles were a scarce article in those parts, but Pecos got one, and\nafter laying bets with various flippant prisoners, he read it from\ncover to cover, religiously. Then, just to show his bringing up, he\nwent back and read over all the big wars and fights and the troubles of\nMoses in the wilderness. Still there was time to spare and he read of\nDaniel and Nehemiah and the prophets who had cried unto Israel. It was\na poor beginning, but somehow when he was reading the Bible he forgot\nthe heat and the vileness of the jail and won back his self-respect. In\nthat long catalogue of priests and prophets and leaders of the people\nwhat one was there, from Joseph to Jesus, who had not been cast into\nprison? The universality of their fate seemed to cheer him and give him\nsomething in common—perhaps they were of some kin with the apostles\nof the revolution. And in the long, suffocating nights he would think\nback to the mud-streaked adobe house that he had called home and hear\nhis mother patting softly on her knees and singing: \"Oh, come to Jesus,\ncome to Jesus—\" with a little Texas _yupe_ at the end of every line. So\nhe wore the summer's heat away, and with the return of cool weather\nhis mind went back to his case.\n\nThere was no use trying to do anything before the grand jury, so\neverybody said; that great bulwark of the people generally indicted\nevery one that the district attorney shook his finger at and let the\njudge find out later whether he was innocent—that was his business,\nanyway. Besides—whatever else he did—Pecos was going to be careful not\nto offend the district attorney. The sad case of Pete Monat, who must\nhave put in an awful summer at Yuma, was ever in his mind, and while\nhe would not go so far as to plead guilty in order to accommodate the\ncholeric Mr. Kilkenny, he was firmly resolved not to antagonize him in\nthe trial. He had money, too—five months' wages, deposited with the\nsheriff—but a hundred and fifty dollars would not hire a man who could\nstand up against District Attorney Kilkenny, the terror of evil-doers.\nAs a man, Shepherd Kilkenny was all right—a devoted husband, a loving\nfather, all the other good things you read on a gravestone—but as\na prosecuting attorney he was a devil. At every biennial election\nhe got all the votes there were on his court record. He convicted\neverybody—except a few whose friends had worked a rabbit's foot for\nthem—and convicted them beyond appeal. That saved money to the county.\nHis reputation for convictions was so great that most of the petty\ncriminals pled guilty and came down like Davey Crockett's coon, before\nhe had a chance to shoot. That expedited the court calendar and saved\nthousands of dollars in fees and witness expenses—another good thing\nfor the honest tax-payer. In fact, everything that Shepherd Kilkenny\ndid was for the benefit of the Geronimo tax-payers, and Yuma was\ncrowded with convicts to prove that he knew his business. That was what\nhe was hired for—to convict law-breakers—and if he let a single guilty\nman escape he was recreant to his trust. Kilkenny had a stern sense of\ncivic responsibility—he got them, if it took a leg.\n\nThere had been a time when Shepherd Kilkenny believed that every man\nwho had the price was innocent. That was when, as a rising young\nlawyer, he was defending criminals in the courts; and he threw so many\nmiscreants loose and made such a show of old Trusdale, the former\ndistrict attorney, that the community in a burst of popular indignation\nput the old man out and gave Kilkenny his job. At this Kilkenny brought\nout an entirely new set of adjectives, changed all his fixed opinions\nin a day, and, being now in a position to square himself with the\nreal Law, which holds that a man is guilty until he can prove himself\ninnocent, he became a flaming sword against the transgressor. His\nconversion also enabled him to slough off the old pathetic-fallacy\nline of talk that he had been called upon to use in pleading before\na jury and to adopt a more dignified and denunciatory style, a cross\nbetween Demosthenes and the Daniel Webster school. The prosperous life\nof a politician jollied him up a bit, too; he developed a certain\nsardonic humor in the handling of unfavorable witnesses, and got off a\ngood one every once in a while for the benefit of the reporters. But\nthere was one thing that Shepherd Kilkenny could not tolerate, and that\nwas another rising young criminal lawyer trying to defeat the ends of\njustice and beat him out of his job. Yuma was full of Pete Monats who\nhad fallen victims to this feud, and Pecos resolved to plead his case\nhimself before he would take chances on a sucking lawyer.\n\nIt was while he was in this vacillating mood and feeling mighty lonely\nand lost to the world that he heard late one night a familiar whoop\nfrom the jag-cell, followed by a fiery oration in the vernacular.\nIt was Angy, down for his periodical drunk, and Pecos could hardly\nwait to clasp him by the hand. It was a peculiar thing about Angevine\nThorne—the drunker he got the more his language improved, until in\nthe ecstasy of his intoxication, he often quoted Greek and Latin, or\nwords deemed by local wiseacres to be derived from those sources.\nDrink also seemed to clarify his vision and give him an exalted sense\nof truth, justice, and man's inhumanity to man. It had been his custom\nin the past at this climacteric stage of inebriation to mount upon\nsome billiard table or other frangible piece of saloon furniture and\ndeliver temperance lectures until removed by the police. But times\nhad changed with Geronimo's champion booze-fighter and in his later\nprepossessions he grappled with the mighty problem of wealth and its\nrelation to the common man. There are some hard sayings in the _Voice\nof Reason_ against the privileged classes, but they are all nicely\nconsidered in relation to the libel law, whereas Angy had no such\ncompunctions. Having spent all his money for drink and received a jail\nsentence for life, the law had no further terrors for him and he turned\nhis eloquence loose. It was a wild rave when Pecos heard it, and grew\nprogressively more incoherent; but as he lay in his bunk and listened\nto the familiar appeals a thought came to Pecos like an inspiration\nfrom the gods—why not turn that stream of eloquence into profitable\nchannels and make Angy his advocate? There was not a voter in Geronimo\nwho did not know Babe Thorne and love him for his foolishness—the\nlife sentence which he suffered for conspicuous drunkenness was but a\ntoken of their regard, placing him above the level of common ordinary\ndrunks even as his eloquence placed him above the maudlin orators with\nwhom the saloons were crowded. He was a character, a standing jest—and\nArizona loves a joke better than life itself. Above all, Angy was a\ngood fellow—he could jolly the district attorney and make him laugh!\nThey would win their case and then he would be free—free! Pecos could\nnot sleep from thinking of it and he begged Bill Todhunter, as a\nspecial favor, to bring Babe in from the jag-cell at once.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" inquired Bill casually, \"are you gettin'\ninterested in yore girl? I hear Old Crit has cut you out.\"\n\n\"Crit be damned!\" cried Pecos. \"Have I ever asked you for anything\nbefore? Well then, throw him in here, can't you?\"\n\nThe deputy did as he was bid and went away—he was not of a prying\ndisposition and Pecos had saved him a lot of trouble. There had never\nbeen an alcalde like Pecos Dalhart. No, indeed—it would rustle them to\nget one half as good when he went his way to Yuma.\n\nThe conference with Angevine Thorne, attorney-at-law, was long,\nand private, but as Angy sobered up he beheld greater and greater\npossibilities in the matter; and when he went away he assured his\nclient that within the calendar month he should step forth a free\nman—free as the prairie wind. He was confident of it, and upon his\ndeparture Pecos gave him fifty dollars to use with José Garcia. Also he\nwas to find Old Funny-face, the mother of the calf, if it took the last\ncow in the barn. But all was to be conducted quietly, very quietly,\nfor if Old Crit ever got wind of any defence he would frame up a case\nto disprove it. To be sure, José Garcia was in debt several hundred\ndollars to Isaac Crittenden—and afraid of his life, to boot—but for\nfifty dollars cash Joe would swear to anything, even the truth; and if\nby so doing he got Pecos out—why, there was a man who could protect him\nagainst Crit and all his cowboys. It looked good to Angevine Thorne\nand, as an especial inducement to Joe to stay put, he swore by all the\nsaints to have his life if he dared to go back on his agreement. Then,\nvery quietly, he instituted a search for Old Funny-face and, having\nlocated her up the river with a tame bunch of cattle, he came away,\nknowing full well that he could produce her at the proper time. There\nwould be a little surprise coming to Isaac Crittenden when he went to\ncourt next week and, being actuated by no feeling of false delicacy in\ndealing with such a reptile, Angy went back to work for him and watched\nthe conspiracy breed.\n\nIt was a constant source of surprise to the transient public to observe\nhow a man with so many disagreeable qualities kept the same men\nworking for him year after year; but to those who knew Crittenden well\nit was as natural as hunger and thirst. In fact, it was intimately\nconnected with hunger and thirst. Any time that Joe Garcia wanted to\nquit he could just tell his wife and six children to stop eating, tie\nhis things in a handkerchief, and walk down the road. José was ruled by\nhunger and the slavish peon spirit of a Mexican—Babe and the cowboys\nwere ruled by thirst. No matter how many times he had been fired or\nquit, a man could always get a chance to work for nothing with Crit;\nand so long as he spent all his money at the store Crittenden was even\nwilling to pay him good wages in the busy season. Babe was the easiest\nmark he had as far as money was concerned, and, being so well educated\nwithal, the illiterate cowman found him almost indispensable as a\nletter-writer and book-keeper. So far, so good—but why did Babe, with\nhis classical education, insist upon donating his services to a man\nwho treated him so despitefully? Ah, it was a hard question, but even\na vagrant likes to have some place, no matter how unlovely, which can\ntake the place of a home. Yet for the six long months that Pecos had\nlain in jail Angy had had reason enough for staying—Marcelina needed\nhim, and she needed him bad.\n\nEvery month seemed to add some new grace and beauty to the daughter\nof José Garcia—the primitive beauty that seems to bud like a flower\nbeneath the Arizona sun; the beauty of the young Apache maiden and the\nslender _Hija de Mejico_, that comes to its perfection so soon and is\ndoomed so often to fade away prematurely before the lust of men. In\nanother place Marcelina's face might have been her fortune, but at\nVerde Crossing it was her bane. The cowboys lingered about the store to\ngaze upon her boldly or stepped outside to intercept her on her way;\nand Joe, poor tortoise-brained Joe, did not live up to his full duty\nas a father. The _Texano_ cowboys were a fierce breed and impatient of\nrestraint—also they held a Mexican to be something below a snake. He\nwas afraid of them, though he rolled his fat eyes and frowned—but most\nof all he feared Old Crit. Ah, there was a man to fear—Ol' Creet—and\nhe held him in his power, him and all his little flock. Day after day,\nas the summer passed, the Boss kept after him, and but for his woman\nhe would have given way. How she did curse him, the _Señora_, his\n_mujer_, and how she did curse Crit—but most of all she cursed their\npoverty, which exposed her child to such a fate. Even the few _pesos_\nto send her to the school were lacking—Marcelina must stay at Verde\nCrossing and fight against her fate. There was only one man who would\nstand by them, and that was Babe. Only for the one time in six months\nhad Babe been drunk, and that was when Crit was away. He had left them\nhis pistols at parting and hurried back, after he had seen Pecos in\nthe jail. Yet after all it was worth the risk, for Babe had brought\nback money—yes, money, fifty dollars in bills— and he offered it all\nto José if he would stand up and tell the truth. What a coward—that\nfoolish José! For a week he weighed his manhood in the balance and was\nafraid—and then Babe had given him two drinks, quick, and made him\npromise, and given the money to his _mujer_. _Madre de Dios_, it was\naccomplished, and the day that Crittenden and his cowboys rode away to\nGeronimo to testify before the grand jury the Señora Garcia followed\nfar behind in the broken-down buggy, and when the town was dark she\ndrove in and left Marcelina at the Sisters' school.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE LAST CHANCE\n\n\nThere was a hot time in old Geronimo on the night that Ike Crittenden\nand his cowboys rode in, and in spite of everything he could do three\nof them wound up in the jag-cell before morning. Nevertheless he had\nplenty of witnesses and to spare, for the grand jury merely went over\nthe same evidence that had been taken before the magistrate and handed\ndown an indictment against Pecos Dalhart, accusing him of feloniously\nand unlawfully marking, branding, or altering the brand on one neat\nanimal, to wit, a spotted calf, belonging to Isaac Crittenden of\nVerde Crossing. It was almost the first case on the calendar and the\narraignment was set for the following Monday. Then Pecos Dalhart,\ndefendant, slouched gloomily back to his cell and sat down to await\nthe issue. The howls of Angevine Thorne, blended with the hoarse\nprotests of Crit's cowboys, floated in to him from the jag-cell and he\nknew his faithful attorney had not deserted him, but what a broken reed\nwas that to lean on when his whole future hung in the balance! Even as\nhe listened he had an uneasy fear that Angy was giving the whole snap\naway to the drunken cowboys and once more he begged Bill Todhunter to\nthrow Babe into the tanks where he could look after him. It was at this\ntime, when things were at their worst, that Shepherd Kilkenny, the\ndistrict attorney, came down to look into his case and find out how he\nwould plead.\n\nHe was a very cautious man, Mr. Kilkenny, and he never had a man\nindicted unless he held his written confession or knew beyond the\nperadventure of a doubt that he could convict him. In the case of Pecos\nDalhart he had been unusually careful, for it was the first case of\ncattle stealing to come before him and most of his constituents were in\nthe cow business; therefore, not to take any chances, he had followed\nit from the magistrate's court to the secret chambers of the grand\njury, and now he was going after a confession. He came with gifts, a\nbrace of cigars, but Pecos was well supplied with cigarette makings and\nwaved them courteously aside. Then they got down to business.\n\n\"Mr. Dalhart,\" began Kilkenny, \"I'm the district attorney and I've come\nto talk over your case with you—in a friendly way, you understand.\nAh—have you engaged an attorney? No? Well, that is hardly necessary,\nyou know, but if you do call in a counsellor I am sure he will advise\nyou to plead 'Guilty.' Ahem—yes, indeed. There's many a man stole his\ncalf and got away with it, but you were caught in the act and observed\nby twenty witnesses. Not the ghost of a chance, you see; but if you\nplead 'Guilty' and throw yourself upon the mercy of the court it will\ncut your sentence in half, probably more. I'm a friend of yours, Mr.\nDalhart, and I've often heard the sheriff speak of your exemplary\ncharacter as a prisoner. All these things are appreciated, you know,\nand I—well, I'll do all I can for you with the judge. Now all you have\nto do is to sign this little paper and—\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Pecos, thrusting the paper back, \"and I sure take it\nkindly of you, Mr. Kilkenny, but I can't plead 'Guilty'—not to please\nnobody—because I'm _not_ guilty.\"\n\n\"Not guilty!\" The district attorney laughed. \"Why, you were taken in\nthe act, Mr. Dalhart. I never saw a more conclusive line of evidence.\"\n\n\"Well,\" grumbled Pecos, \"if I was guilty I'd sure plead 'Guilty,' you\ncan bank on that. But this blankety-blank, Ike Crittenden, has jest\nframed up a lot of evidence to railroad me to the pen—and them cowboys\nof his would swear to anything for the drinks. You wouldn't soak a man\non evidence like that, would you, Mr. District Attorney?\"\n\n\"I'd soak him on any evidence I could get,\" responded the district\nattorney succinctly. \"You know my reputation, Mr. Dalhart— I convict\nevery man that pleads 'Not guilty'!\"\n\n\"But s'pose he isn't guilty!\" cried Pecos.\n\n\"I convict him anyway!\" replied the district attorney. \"Are you going\nto sign this, or are you going ahead like a damned fool and get the\nlimit in Yuma?\"\n\n\"I won't sign it,\" said Pecos firmly.\n\n\"Very well,\" responded Kilkenny, closing his little book with a snap.\nHe rose to his full height and pursed his lips ominously. \"Very well,\nMr. Dalhart!\" he said, nodding and blinking his eyes. \"Very well,\nsir!\" Then he retired, leaving so much unsaid that it threw Pecos into\na panic. In a very real picture he could see himself sitting in the\nshade of a big adobe wall and making State's-prison bridles for life.\nHe could see the guards pacing back and forth on top of the bastions\nand Pete Monat holding one end of a horse-hair strand while he swung a\nlittle trotter and twisted the loose hairs into the other end, forever\nand forever. It was awful. The full sense of his impending doom rushed\nin upon him and he laid hold of the sodden Babe who was maundering\nabout the revolution, and shook him frantically.\n\n\"My God, Angy,\" he cried, \"wake up and do something! Fergit about the\ncommon people and do something for _me_! Fergit that you ever had any\nprinciples and he'p me fight that low-lived dastard or I'll go to Yuma\nfor life!\"\n\n\"The voice of the people shall rule in the land!\" pronounced Angy\noracularly.\n\n\"To hell with the people!\" yelled Pecos. \"It's the People that's tryin'\nto send me up! Do you want me to git twelve years for brandin' that\nspotted calf? Well, wake up, then, and git yore wits to work!\"\n\nAngy woke up, by degrees, but his wits would not work. The ecstasy\nof intoxication was past and his mind was a legal blank for the\nremainder of that day. The day was Friday, and Pecos had to plead on\nMonday—\"Guilty\" or \"Not guilty.\" \"Guilty\" meant six or eight years in\nprison; \"Not guilty\" meant twelve years—or freedom. It was a gamble,\nbut he would risk it if Angy would remain sober enough to talk. His\nonly chance of freedom lay in his friend's misdirected eloquence, and\nwhen Babe was entirely himself Pecos backed him up into a corner and\ntalked to him with tears in his voice.\n\n\"Never, never, never—\" began Angy, holding up his hand to swear; but\nPecos stopped him with a sign.\n\n\"Nothing like that, Pardner,\" he said. \"You been breakin' that pledge\nfor forty years. Jest look me in the eye now and promise me you won't\ntech a drop until I'm free.\"\n\n\"All right, Pecos,\" agreed Angy, \"I'll do it, I won't touch a drop till\nyou're free.\"\n\n\"And when I'm free,\" continued Pecos, \"I'll stake you to a drunk from\nwhich Geronimo will sure date time. Now let's git down to business.\"\n\nThe details of that campaign against the People were talked over in\nhushed secrecy and when on Monday morning Pecos appeared before the\nstern judge to plead, Angevine Thorne stood just within the rail,\nshuffling his worn hat nervously.\n\n\"I will call the case of the People versus Pecos Dalhart,\" said the\njudge. \"Pecos Dalhart, to the charge of grand larceny do you plead\n'Guilty' or 'Not guilty'?\"\n\n\"'Not guilty,' Your Honor!\" responded Pecos.\n\n\"The defendant enters a plea of 'Not guilty,'\" observed the judge\nimpassively. \"Are you represented by counsel, Mr. Dalhart?\"\n\n\"No, Your Honor,\" replied Pecos.\n\n\"You understand, do you not, that in case you are unable to employ an\nattorney the court will appoint one to advise you, free of charge?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Honor,\" answered Pecos, \"but if it's all the same to you I'd\nrather not have a lawyer. I'd like to ask a favor, Judge, if you don't\nmind. The reason I don't want an attorney appointed is that I know very\nwell none of these lawyers around here can stand up to the district\nattorney when it comes to a case of law\"—here Kilkenny smiled grimly to\nhimself and glanced at Mr. Baker of the _Blade_—\"but at the same time,\nJudge, I do want some one to speak for me, and I'm goin' to ask you to\nappoint my friend Mr. Thorne, back there, as my counsellor.\"\n\n\"Mr. Thorne?\" inquired the judge, and as Angy stepped forward, smirking\nand bowing, a slight smile broke up the fine legal lines on the\njudicial brows. At no time was Angy over-fastidious about his attire,\nand a night in jail, particularly in the jag-cell, is warranted to\nspoil the appearance of the finest suit of clothes that was ever made.\nAngy's clothes were old and worn; his shirt was greasy around the neck,\nand his overalls, hanging loosely about his hips, piled up in slovenly\nrolls above his shoe-tops; his hat, from much fanning of open fires,\nwas grimed with ashes and whitened with splashes of sour dough, and\nhis shiny bald head and red face told all too plainly the story of his\npast. In the titter that followed his announcement he stood silent,\nrolling his bloodshot eyes upon the audience, but as the grinning\nbailiff smote the table for order he turned with the dignity of an\norator and addressed the judge.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he said, beginning the set speech which he had prepared,\n\"I am not unaware that this request on the part of the defendant is a\nlittle irregular, but if the court please I should like to state the\nreasons—\"\n\n\"Just a moment!\" cut in the district attorney brusquely. \"Your Honor,\nI object to this man being appointed to the position of counsellor on\nthe ground that he is not a duly-licensed attorney and therefore not\ncompetent to practise in this court.\"\n\n\"As I am tendering my services without hope of compensation,\"\nobserved Angy suavely, \"and also without submitting briefs or other\nlegal papers, I hope that the court will overlook this trifling\nirregularity. The law referred to by the district attorney, as applied\nto this case, was intended solely to protect the defendant in his\nrights, the inference being that no one not a regularly practising\nattorney is competent to adequately represent the defendant against\nthe learned district attorney\"—Angy bowed to that gentleman—\"but at\nthe same time, Your Honor, I wish to say that in days gone by I have\nstood before the bar\"—the bailiff struck his gavel to quiet the sudden\nlaughter—\"I have stood before the bar of justice, Your Honor, and I\nhave stood there, sir, not as Angevine Thorne, the drunkard, but as a\nregular practitioner in that court. I submit, Your Honor, that I am\nfully qualified, both by past experience and present information, to\nrepresent Mr. Dalhart in this unfortunate case!\"\n\nA murmur of astonishment passed around the room at this revelation of\nhis past; for while Angevine Thorne had been about Geronimo, drunk and\nsober, for over twenty years, he had never referred except in the\nvaguest terms to the life which he had left behind. It struck wonder\ninto the breasts of the court-room bums, many of whom had shared\nthe jag-cell with him in times past, and Mr. Baker of the _Blade_\nsank down into a seat and began to write hurriedly upon his pad; but\nShepherd Kilkenny, with a sudden premonition of what Angy's \"present\ninformation\" might lead to, did not yield himself to any such puny\nemotion as surprise. He was a fighter, and a sure-thing fighter to boot.\n\n\"Your Honor!\" he cried, \"I wish to protest most—\"\n\n\"Objection is overruled!\" interposed the judge. \"I see no reason why\nMr. Thorne should not conduct this case if the defendant so wishes, and\nthe clerk will enter him accordingly. Would Wednesday be too soon for\nyou to prepare your argument, Mr. Thorne? Is it satisfactory to you,\nMr. Kilkenny? Very well, then, I will set the case for Wednesday, the\neighth of October, at ten A. M. Call the next case, Mr. Bailiff!\"\n\nThe bailiff called it, still smiling, and in the pause half the\noccupants of the court-room boiled out onto the court-house lawn and\ngave vent to their pent-up emotions. Babe Thorne was going to buck\nKilkenny and plead a case in court! He would make an impassioned\nappeal and raise Cain with Ike Crittenden's witnesses—it would be an\nevent never to be forgotten! Still laughing they scattered through\nthe town, and soon men came hurrying forth from the different saloons\nto verify the report; they gathered in a crowd by the sheriff's\noffice and, as the word spread that it was true, gangs of cowboys and\nmen on livery-stable plugs went dashing down the streets, whooping\nand laughing and crying the news to their friends. It was a new\nexcitement—something doing—and the way an Arizona town will take on\nover some such trifling event is nothing short of scandalous. Within\ntwo hours the leisure male population of Geronimo was divided into\ntwo hostile camps—those who would get Babe drunk before the event\nand those who would keep him sober and have him take a fall out of\nKilkenny. On the one side it was argued that, unless he was properly\nginned up, Babe would not do justice to the occasion; but cooler heads\nwon on the proposition that the judge would bar him if he got drunk\nand hollered, and a committee of prominent citizens was organized to\nprotect him from himself.\n\nBeing quick to see the news value of the incident the _Blade_ printed\nan exclusive interview with Angevine Thorne—formerly of the Kentucky\nbar—and announced that the trial would be covered in detail by \"our\nMr. Baker.\" A series of Communications, written under pressure in the\ncard-rooms of various casinos, expressed the greatest indignation\nat the \"dastardly attempt of a certain interested party to debar\nMr. Thorne from the trial,\" and the hope that this exhibition of\nprofessional jealousy would receive the rebuke it so richly deserved.\nIn an editorial the _Daily Blade_ spoke at some length of the rare\neloquence of \"our gifted fellow-citizen, Colonel Thorne,\" and\nfelicitated Alcalde Dalhart upon the acumen he had shown in retaining\ncounsel. Everything goes, in a case like that, and the _Blade_ played\nit up to the limit.\n\nAs night came on a select circle of visitors gathered at the county\njail to witness the kangaroo trial of two more of Crit's cowboys who\nhad unwittingly placed themselves in the power of Pecos Dalhart. The\nsummary punishment of the first three—the ones who had occupied the\njag-cell with Angevine Thorne—had been heralded far and wide as an\nexample of poetic justice, but the grim humor of this last arraignment\nset the town in an uproar. Within two days these same booze-fighting\ncowboys would appear against him in the upper court, but of that event\nPecos Dalhart took no thought and he kangarooed them to a finish. It\nwas good business, as the actors say, and won him many a friend, for\nArizona loves a sport—but after they had been spread-eagled over a\nchair and received twenty blows for contempt of court, the cowboys\nwere ready to take their oath to anything. That was it—Pecos might\nwin the hearts of the people and still go down before the law and the\nevidence. Only two things cheered him on—Angy and Bill Todhunter had\ngone up the river for Old Funny-face, and Joe Garcia was in town. After\nCrit had sworn himself into perdition over the calf they would spring\nFunny-face on him—Mexican brands and all—and show that he was a liar.\nThen José Garcia would testify to the sale of Funny-face and her calf\nand the rest would go off in a canter. It was a pleasing dream, and\nPecos indulged it to the full, for it was the only hope he had. But the\nnext morning he was nervous.\n\nIt was the day before his trial and even his six months in jail had\nnot taught him to be patient. As soon as the cells were unlocked he\nbegan to pace up and down the corridor like a caged lion, scowling and\nmuttering to himself. To the stray visitors who dropped in he was\ndistant but civil, as befits a man who must act his part, but all the\ntime a growing uneasiness was gnawing at his heart and he looked past\nthem to the outer door. Hours dragged by and his uneasiness changed\ninto despair; he hurled himself upon his bunk and was lying with his\nhaggard face to the bars when the jail deputy entered and gazed in upon\nhim curiously.\n\n\"They's a lady out here to see you,\" he whispered, laying his finger\nalong his nose with an air of roguish secrecy, \"shall I bring her in?\nShe's got something she wants to give you!\"\n\nA vision of the unbalanced females who had been bringing flowers to a\nmurderer came over Pecos and he debated swiftly with himself whether to\naccept this last humiliation or plead a sudden indisposition.\n\n\"She's been waiting around all the morning,\" continued the deputy.\n\"Kinder shy, I reckon—shall I bring 'er in? She's a Mex!\"\n\nA Mex! The word shocked Pecos like a blow; it made him glad, and then\nit made him angry.\n\n\"Well, what's the matter with a Mex?\" he demanded sharply. \"Ain't a\nMexican got no rights in this dam' jail? I guess she's as good as any\nwhite woman—show her in!\"\n\nHe waited in palpitating silence, and when the soft rustle of skirts\nsounded down the corridor his heart stopped beating entirely. Then\nMarcelina pressed her face against the screened bars and gazed\nwistfully into the darkened cell. She had grown taller since he last\nsaw her and her dark eyes had taken on a look of infinite melancholy;\nthe rare promise of her youth had flowered suddenly in his absence and\nshe stood before him a woman. Often in his dreams he had thought of\nher, but always as the black-eyed girl, saucy and fugitive as a bird,\nwho had bewitched him with her childish graces; now she peered in at\nhim through the prison bars with the eyes of a woman who has suffered\nand found her soul. For a moment she gazed into the darkness,\nand then she drew back involuntarily. The Pecos she had known was a\ngrown-up boy, grim and quick in speech but full of the reckless fire of\nyouth; a dashing cowboy, guiding his horse by a touch of the hand and\nriding, riding, always. Here was a hard-faced man, pale and bowed by\nconfinement, and his eyes were like a starved animal's. She started and\nbit her lip.\n\n\"Are you Paycos?\" she asked timidly.\n\nThe bitterness of his fate swept over Pecos at the words—he looked down\nat his crumpled clothes, his outworn boots, and faded shirt and rumbled\nin his throat.\n\n\"No, Marcelina,\" he said, \"I'm only a caged wolf—a coyote that the\nvaqueros have roped and tied and fastened to a tree. I'm a hard-looker,\nall right—how'd you come to find me?\"\n\n[Illustration: She laid a brown hand against the bars as if in protest\nand motioned him nearer the screen]\n\nShe laid a brown hand against the bars as if in protest and motioned\nhim nearer the screen.\n\n\"I have only been in town four days,\" she said hurriedly. \"All summer\nI was shut up at Verde, and Ol' Creet—ah, that bad, ba-ad man! My\nmother took me to school the day he come to Geronimo. I am 'fraid,\nPaycos—but this morning I run away to see you. The seesters will be\nhunt for me now. Look Paycos\"—she thrust her hand into the bosom\nof her dress and drew forth a small bundle, wrapped in a blue silk\nhandkerchief—\"_Cuidado_, be careful,\" she whispered; \"when I keess you\ngood-bye at the door I weel put thees een your hand—_ssst!_\" She turned\nand looked up the corridor where the deputy was doing the Sherlock.\nHe was a new man—the jail deputy—just helping out during the session\nof the court and correspondingly impressed with his own importance.\nNothing larger than a darning-needle could be passed through the heavy\niron screen, but all the same he kept his eye on them, and when he saw\nthe quick thrust of her hand all the suspicions of the amateur sleuth\nrushed over him at once.\n\n\"Hey! What's that?\" he demanded, striding down the run-around. \"What\nyou got hid there, eh?\" He ogled Marcelina threateningly as he stood\nover her and she shrank before his glance like a school-girl. \"Come,\nnow,\" he blustered, \"show me what that is or I'll take it away from\nyou. We don't allow anything to be passed in to the prisoners!\"\n\n\"She can't pass nothin' through here!\" interposed Pecos, tapping on the\nscreen. \"You haven't got nothin', have you, Marcelina?\"\n\n\"Well, I saw her hide something blue in her dress just now,\" persisted\nthe jailer, \"and I want to see it, that's all!\"\n\n\"It was—it was only a handkerchief!\" sobbed Marcelina, clutching at\nher breast. \"No, no! Eet is mine—he—he geev it to me! You can not—\"\nshe choked, and backed swiftly toward the door. Like a panther Pecos\nwhipped out of his cell and sprang against the corridor grating, but\nshe was gone. The deputy made a futile grab as she darted away from\nhim and sprang after her, but she swung the great door in his face and\nsped like a deer down the hall. The next moment she was gone, leaving\nPecos and the deputy to have it out together.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried the deputy vengefully, \"you will try to smuggle things in,\nwill you? I'll report this matter to Mr. Morgan at once!\"\n\n\"Well, report it, then, you low-flung hound!\" wailed Pecos, \"report\nit, and be damned to you! But if I was outside these bars I'd beat you\nto death for this!\" They raged up and down the grating, snarling at\neach other like dogs that fight through a lattice, and even when Boone\nMorgan came and called them down Pecos would not be appeased.\n\n\"He scairt my girl away!\" he cried, scowling menacingly at the raw\ndeputy. \"She come to give me a handkerchief and he jumped at her. I'll\nfix him, the dastard, if ever I git a chance!\" And so he raged and\nstormed until they went away and left him, mystified. To Boone Morgan\nit seemed as if his alcalde was raising a row out of all proportion to\nhis grievance, but that was because Pecos could not explain his woes.\nMarcelina had promised to kiss him good-bye, and the damned deputy had\nintervened!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE LAW AND THE EVIDENCE\n\n\nAs the rising sun poured its flood of glorious light into the\ncourt-house square and the janitor, according to his custom, threw\nopen the court-room doors to sweep, there was a scuffling of eager\nfeet from without and the swift-moving pageantry of the Dalhart\ntrial began. A trio of bums who had passed the night _al fresco_ on\nthe park benches hustled past the astounded caretaker and bestowed\nthemselves luxuriously on the front seats. As the saloons opened up and\ndischarged their over-night guests others of the brotherhood drifted\nin and occupied the seats behind, and by the time the solid citizens\nof Geronimo had taken care of their stock, snatched their breakfasts,\nand hurried to the scene there was standing room only in the teeming\nchamber of justice. Only the special venire of jurymen took their time\nin the matter and the sweating bailiff had to pass them in through\nthe side door in order to get them seated inside the railing. At\nnine-thirty Boone Morgan brought in the defendant, freshly shaven and\nwith his hair plastered down across his forehead, and sat with him near\nthe jail door. It was all in the line of duty, but there were those\nwho remarked that it was right clever of old Boone to throw in that\nway with his jail alcalde. Some people would have put the nippers on\nhim for the cow-thief that he was, and chained him to a deputy. Behind\nthem, the cynosure of all eyes, sat the counsel for the defendant,\nAngevine Thorne, his round baby face illuminated with the light of a\ngreat resolve. On that day he was going to save his friend from prison\nor climb spider-webs in the attempt. A hush fell over the assembly\nas the hour of trial drew near and only the gaunt figure of Shepherd\nKilkenny, pacing up and down before the empty jury-box, suggested the\nbattle that was to come. The rest was as pathetic as the Angelus.\n\nThe soft morning breeze breathed in through the windows and as Pecos\nglimpsed the row of horses tied to the hitching rack he filled his\nlungs deep with the sweet air, and sighed. The invalid who has been\nconfined to his room longs vaguely for the open air, but to the strong\nman of action, shut up for months in a close cell, the outer world\nseems like a dream of paradise and he sees a new heaven in the skies.\nIn the tense silence of waiting the tragedy in his face afflicted the\nmorbid crowd and made them uneasy; they shifted their eyes to the\nstern, fighting visage of the district attorney and listened hopefully\nfor the clock. It struck, slowly and with measured pauses, and as the\nlast stroke sounded through the hall the black curtain behind the bench\nparted and the judge stepped into court. Then instantly the sheriff's\ngavel came down upon the table; the People rose before the person of\nthe Law, and in sonorous tones Boone Morgan repeated the ancient\nformula for the calling of the court.\n\n\"_Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!_ The District Court of Geronimo County is now in\nsession!\"\n\nThe judge threw off his robes and sat down and as the audience sank\nback into their crowded seats he cast one swift, judicial glance at the\ndefendant, the clerk, and the district attorney and called the case\nof Pecos Dalhart, charged with the crime of grand larceny. With the\nsmoothness of well-worn machinery the ponderous wheels of justice began\nto turn, never halting, never faltering, until the forms prescribed\nby law had been observed. One after the other, the clerk called the\nnames of the forty talesmen, writing each name on a slip of paper as\nthe owner answered \"Here\"; then at a word from the judge he placed the\nslips in a box and shook out twelve names upon the table. As his name\nwas called and spelled each talesman rose from his seat and shambled\nover to the jury-box, turning his solemn face from the crowd. They\nheld up their right hands and swore to answer truthfully all questions\nrelative to their qualifications as jurors, and sat down to listen\nto the charges; then, after reading the information upon which the\naccusations were based, the district attorney glanced shrewdly at the\ncounsel for defendant and called the first juryman. The battle had\nbegun.\n\nThe first talesman was a tall, raw-boned individual with cowman written\nall over him, and the district attorney was careful not to ask his\noccupation. He wanted a jury of twelve cowmen, no less; and, knowing\nevery man in the venire either by sight or reputation, he laid himself\nout to get it.\n\n\"Mr. Rambo,\" he began, \"do you know the defendant in this case?\" He\nindicated Pecos Dalhart with a contemptuous wave of the hand, and Mr.\nRambo said he did not. \"Know anything about this case?\"\n\n\"Only what I read in the papers,\" responded the cowman dryly.\n\n\"You don't believe everything you read, do you, Mr. Rambo? If you were\npassed for a juror you wouldn't let anything you have read influence\nyour mind, if it was proven that the defendant was guilty, would you?\"\n\n\"No, sir!\"\n\n\"If I should prove to your satisfaction that the defendant\nhere\"—another contemptuous wave of the hand—\"had wilfully and\nfeloniously stolen and branded the animal in question, what would your\nverdict be—'Guilty' or 'Not guilty'?\"\n\n\"W'y—er—'Guilty'!\"\n\n\"Pass the juror!\" snapped the district attorney, and then he looked at\nthe counsel for the defendant as if imploring him not to waste any of\nthe court's valuable time.\n\n\"Mr. Rambo,\" began Angy, singing the words in a child-like, embarrassed\nmanner, \"you are engaged in the business of raising cattle, are you\nnot?\"\n\nThe district attorney winced at this, but Angevine Thorne did not take\nadvantage of his discovery. He also wanted a jury of twelve cowmen,\nthough he did not show his hand.\n\n\"Very good,\" he observed, \"and I suppose, Mr. Rambo, that you are\nacquainted with the law in this case which makes it a felony for any\nman to mark or brand the stock of another man? Very good. Have you any\nprejudice against that law, Mr. Rambo? You believe that it should be\nenforced impartially, do you not—against the rich as well as the poor?\nVery good. Pass the juror!\"\n\nFor a moment Shepherd Kilkenny could hardly believe his ears. The drift\nof every one of the questions had led naturally up to a challenge and\nyet at the end Angy had passed the juror. He glanced quickly at the\ninnocent face of his opponent, opened his mouth to speak, and then\nhurried on with his examination. The second man was interested in the\ncattle business, too; and when Angy passed him the judge felt called\nupon to speak.\n\n\"You know, do you not, Mr. Thorne,\" he said, \"that it is your\nprivilege to excuse any juror whose occupation or condition of mind\nmight indicate a prejudice against your client?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Your Honor,\" replied Mr. Thorne, suavely, \"but I have\nperfect confidence in the integrity of the two gentlemen just passed. I\nfeel sure that they will do full justice to Mr. Dalhart.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" said His Honor, \"let the examination proceed!\"\n\nWith all the address of a good tactician who sees that his opponent\nhas mistaken a two-spot for an ace, Shepherd Kilkenny flew at his\ntask, but each time that Angy passed one of his cowmen he paused just\nthe fraction of a second, glanced apprehensively about the room, and\nrubbed his chin thoughtfully. The defence was playing right into his\nhand, but he didn't know whether he liked it or not. When it came to\nthe peremptory challenges he excused two health-seekers and a mining\nman, but Thorne did not challenge a man. Once more the clerk shook\nthe names out of his box and within half an hour the district attorney\nhad the very jury he wanted—every man of them interested in the cattle\nbusiness and ready to cinch a rustler as they would kill a rattlesnake.\nIt seemed almost too good to be true. Even the staid judge was\nconcerned, for he had a sober sense of justice and Angy's appointment\nhad been slightly irregular; but after a long look at that individual\nhe motioned for the trial to proceed. The evidence was all against the\ndefendant anyway, and he could cut off a year or two on the sentence to\nmake amends.\n\n\"Swear the jurors!\" he said, and holding up their rope-scarred hands\nand looking coldly across the room at the alleged rustler, the twelve\ncowmen swore to abide by the law and the evidence and a true verdict\nfind. Then the district attorney pulled his notes from his hip-pocket\nas a man might draw a deadly weapon and began his opening statement to\nthe jury.\n\n\"Your Honor and gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, \"in the case of the\nPeople of the Territory of Arizona _versus_ Pecos Dalhart, we shall\nshow that on or about the eighth day of May the said Pecos Dalhart did\nwilfully, feloniously, and unlawfully pursue, rope, and brand a calf,\nsaid calf being the property of Isaac Crittenden of Verde Crossing,\nTerritory of Arizona; that the said Pecos Dalhart was arrested and,\nupon being taken before a magistrate, he did plead 'Not guilty' and was\nheld for the grand jury, which handed down an indictment against him;\nthat upon being arraigned before the judge he did plead 'Not guilty'\nand was remanded for trial upon the crime charged in the indictment,\nto wit:—that he did feloniously and unlawfully mark, brand, or alter\nthe brand on a neat animal, to wit, one red-and-white spotted calf,\nsaid calf being the property of Isaac Crittenden, of Verde Crossing,\nTerritory of Arizona, contrary to the form, force, and effect of the\nstatute in such case made and provided and against the peace and\ndignity of the People of the Territory of Arizona. Mr. Crittenden, will\nyou please take the stand!\"\n\nAll the other witnesses had been relegated to the jury-room, where\nthey would be beyond the sound of the court, but being the complaining\nwitness Isaac Crittenden was entitled to remain and he sat just behind\nthe district attorney, fumbling with the high collar that galled his\nscrawny neck and rolling his evil eye upon the assemblage. As he rose\nup from his place and mounted the witness stand a rumble of comment\npassed through the hall and the sheriff struck his gavel sharply for\norder.\n\n\"Swear the witness, Mr. Clerk,\" directed the judge, and raising his\nright hand in the air Isaac Crittenden rose and faced the court,\nlooking a trifle anxious and apprehensive, as befits one who is about\nto swear to a lie. Also, not being used to actions in court, he\nentertained certain illusions as to the sanctity of an oath, illusions\nwhich were, however, speedily banished by the professional disrespect\nof the clerk. Reaching down under the table for a penholder which\nhe had dropped and holding one hand weakly above his head he recited\nwith parrot-like rapidity the wearisome formula of the oath:—\"Do you\nsolemnly swear that the evidence you are about to give in the case of\nthe People _versus_ Pecos Dalhart shall be the truth, the whole truth,\nand nothing but the truth, s'elpyougod?\"\n\nCrittenden blinked his good eye and sat down. There was nothing very\nimpressive about the proceeding, but all the same he was liable for\nperjury.\n\n\"Calling your attention to the eighth day of May, of the present\nyear, where were you on that day, Mr. Crittenden?\" It was the first\ngun in the real engagement and the surging crowd about the doors quit\nscrouging for a view and poised their heads to listen. The voice of the\ndistrict attorney was very quiet and reassuring, and Isaac Crittenden,\ntaking his cue, answered with the glib readiness of a previous\nunderstanding.\n\n\"I was gathering cattle with my cowboys near my ranch at Verde\nCrossing.\"\n\n\"And upon returning to your home did you encounter any one in the deep\n_arroyo_ which lies above your ranch?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" responded Crittenden, \"I come across Pecos Dalhart.\"\n\n\"Is this the gentleman to whom you refer?\" inquired Kilkenny, pointing\nan accusing thumb toward Pecos. \"Very good, then—you identify the\ndefendant. Now, Mr. Crittenden, what was the defendant doing at that\ntime?\"\n\n\"He had a spotted calf of mine strung out by a little fire and was\nalterin' the brand with a runnin' iron.\" Old Crit's eye wandered\ninstinctively to Pecos Dalhart as he spoke and gleamed with a hidden\nfire, but his face was as expressionless as a death mask.\n\n\"I offer the following animal in evidence,\" said the district attorney,\nbeckoning toward the side door. \"Bring in the exhibit!\" And as Bill\nTodhunter appeared, sheepishly leading the spotted calf, which had\nbeen boarded all summer in town, he threw out his hand dramatically and\nhissed:\n\n\"Do you identify this animal? Is that the calf?\"\n\n\"I do!\" responded Crit. \"It is the same animal!\"\n\n\"That's all!\" announced Kilkenny, and with a grin of triumph he\nsummoned the hawk-eyed jurymen to inspect the brand. There it was,\nwritten on the spotted side of the calf, in ineffaceable lines—the\nplain record of Pecos Dalhart's crime, burned with his own hands.\nAcross the older scar of Isaac Crittenden's brand there ran a\nfresh-burnt bar, and below the barred Spectacle was a Monkey-wrench,\nseared in the tender hide. To a health-seeker or a mining man the\nsignificance of those marks might be hidden, but the twelve cowmen\non the jury read it like a book. Only one thing gave them a passing\nuneasiness—Crit's Spectacle brand was very evidently devised to burn\nover Pecos Dalhart's Monkey-wrench, but that was beside the point.\nThey were there to decide whether Pecos Dalhart had stolen that\nparticular spotted calf, and the markings said that he did. By that\nbroad bar which ran through the pair of Spectacles he deprived Isaac\nCrittenden of its ownership, and by the Monkey-wrench burned below he\ntook it for his own. All right then,—they retired to their seats and\nAngevine Thorne took the witness.\n\nThey faced each other for a minute—the man who had committed a crime\nand covered it, and the man who had sworn to expose his guilt—and began\ntheir fencing warily.\n\n\"Mr. Crittenden,\" purred Angy, \"you are in the cattle business, are you\nnot? Yes, indeed; and about how many cattle have you running on your\nrange?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" answered Crittenden gruffly.\n\n\"At the last time you paid your taxes you were assessed for about ten\nthousand, were you not? Quite correct; I have the statement of the\nassessor here to verify it. Now, Mr. Crittenden, kindly tell the jury\nwhat per cent of those cattle are calves?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Crit.\n\n\"No?\" said Angy, with assumed surprise. \"Well then, I hope the court\nwill excuse me for presuming to tell a cowman about cows but the\npercentage of calves on an ordinary range is between fifty and sixty\nper cent. So, according to that you have on your range between five and\nsix thousand calves, have you not? Very good. And now, Mr. Crittenden,\nspeaking roughly, about how many of your cattle are solid color?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" scowled Crit.\n\n\"You don't know,\" repeated Angy gravely. \"Very good. I wish the\ncourt to note that Mr. Crittenden is a very poor observer. Now, Mr.\nCrittenden, you have stated that you do not know how many cattle you\nhave; nor how many of said cattle are calves; nor how many of said\ncalves are solid color or spotted. Will you kindly inform the court,\nthen, how you know that the calf which has been produced in evidence\nis yours?\"\n\n\"Well—\" said Crittenden, and then he stopped. The one thing which he\nwas afraid of in this trial was about to happen—Angy was going to\ncorner him on the maternity of the calf, and that would make him out a\ncow-thief. The district attorney scowled at him to go ahead and then,\nin order to cover up the failure, he leapt to his feet and cried:\n\n\"Your Honor, I object to the line of questioning on the ground that it\nis irrelevant, incompetent, and immaterial!\"\n\n\"If the court please,\" spoke up Angevine Thorne, \"the witness has\npositively identified the calf in question as his own, although it is\na matter of record that he possesses four or five thousand calves, all\nof which have been born within the past year and over half of which are\nspotted. It is the purpose of the defence to prove that this calf does\nnot belong to the witness; that it was the property of Pecos Dalhart\nat the time the alleged crime was committed, _and that it had been\npreviously stolen by Isaac Crittenden_!\"\n\nAs he shouted these words Angy pointed an accusing finger at Old Crit,\nwho started back like a man who had been struck, and while the clamor\nof deputies and bailiffs filled the court-room they stood there like\nthe figures in a tableau, glaring at each other with inextinguishable\nhatred.\n\n\"Order in the court! Order in the court!\" cried the bailiffs, beating\nback the crowd, and when the assembly had been quieted the judge\nmotioned to Angy to proceed.\n\n\"Objection is overruled,\" he said, and bent his dark brows upon Isaac\nCrittenden. \"Let the witness answer the question.\"\n\n\"Well, the calf had my brand on it,\" responded Crittenden defiantly,\nand then, egged on by Angy's sarcastic smile, he went a step too far.\n\"Yes, and I know him, too!\" he blurted out. \"I'd know that calf among a\nthousand, by them spots across his face.\"\n\n\"Oh, you would, would you?\" spoke up Angy quickly. \"You have a\ndistinct recollection of the animal on account of its peculiar markings\nthen; is that right? Very good. When did you put your brand on that\ncalf, Mr. Crittenden?\"\n\n\"Last Spring,\" replied Crittenden grudgingly.\n\n\"You know the law regarding the branding of calves,\" prompted Angy.\n\"Was the calf with its mother at the time?\"\n\n\"It was!\"\n\n\"And did she bear the same brand that you burned upon her calf?\"\n\n\"She did!\"\n\n\"Any other brands?\"\n\n\"Nope!\"\n\n\"Raised her yourself, did you?\"\n\n\"_Yes!_\" shouted Crittenden angrily.\n\n\"That's all!\" said Angy briefly, and Isaac Crittenden sank back into\nhis chair, dazed at the very unexpectedness of his escape. It was a\nperilous line of questioning that his former roustabout had taken up,\nleading close to the stealing of Upton's cattle and the seizing of\nPecos Dalhart's herd, but at the very moment when he might have sprung\nthe mine Angy had withheld his hand. The gaunt cowman tottered to his\nseat in a smother of perspiration, and Shepherd Kilkenny, after a\nmoment's consideration, decided to make his hand good by calling a host\nof witnesses.\n\nThey came into court, one after the other, the hard-faced gun-men that\nCrittenden kept about his place, and with the unblinking assurance of\nmen who gamble even with life itself they swore to the stereotyped\nfacts, while Angy said never a word.\n\n\"The People rest!\" announced the district attorney at last, and lay\nback smiling in his chair to see what his opponent would spring.\n\n\"Your Honor and gentlemen of the jury,\" began Angevine Thorne, speaking\nwith the easy confidence of a barrister, \"the prosecution has gone\nto great lengths to prove that Pecos Dalhart branded this calf. The\ndefence freely admits that act, but denies all felonious intent. We\nwill show you, gentlemen of the jury, that at the time he branded the\nanimal it was by law and right his own, and that during his absence it\nhad been feloniously and unlawfully branded into the Spectacle brand by\nthe complaining witness, Isaac Crittenden. Mr. Dalhart, will you please\ntake the stand!\"\n\nAwkward and shamefaced in the presence of the multitude and painfully\nconscious of his jail clothes, Pecos mounted to the stand and turned\nto face his inquisitor. They had rehearsed the scene before—for\nBabe Thorne was not altogether ignorant of a lawyer's wiles—and his\nexamination went off as smoothly as Kilkenny's examination of Crit,\ndown to the point where Pecos was rudely pounced upon and roped while\nhe was branding his spotted calf. Then it was that Angevine Thorne's\nvoice began to ring like a trumpet, and as he came to the crucial\nquestion the audience stood motionless to listen.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Dalhart,\" he clarioned, \"you say that you purposely barred\nthe Spectacle brand upon this calf and burned your own brand, which\nwas a Monkey-wrench, below it? What was your reason for that act?\"\n\n\"My reason was that the calf was mine!\" cried Pecos, rising angrily to\nhis feet. \"When I first come to Verde Crossing I bought an old spotted\ncow and her calf from José Garcia and branded them with a Monkey-wrench\non the ribs—I kept her around my camp for a milk cow. That first calf\ngrowed up and she was jest comin' in with another one when I went to\nNew Mexico last Fall. Well, when I came back last Spring I hadn't got\ninto town yet when I come across my old milk cow with her ears all\nchopped up and her brand burned over and this little calf, lookin' jest\nlike her, with a Spectacle brand burned on his ribs. That made me mad\nand I was jest ventin' the calf back to a Monkey-wrench when Crittenden\nand his cowboys jumped in and roped me!\"\n\n\"You say that you bought the mother of this calf from José Garcia?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir! I paid him twenty-five dollars for the cow and five dollars\nfor the first calf.\"\n\n\"What were the brand and markings of this cow at the time you bought\nher?\"\n\n\"She had a Mexican brand, like an Injun arrer struck by lightning, on\nher left hip, a big window or _ventano_ in the left ear, and a slash\nand underbit in the right. Garcia vented his brand on her shoulder and\nI run a Monkey-wrench—that's my regular, registered brand—on her ribs,\nbut I never changed her ear marks because I kept her for a milk cow\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Your Honor,\" interposed Kilkenny, rising with a bored air to his\nfeet, \"I object to this testimony on the ground that it is irrelevant,\nincompetent, and immaterial. I fail to see the relation of this\nhypothetical milk cow to the question before the court.\"\n\n\"The cow in question was the mother of the calf which my client is\naccused of stealing!\" cried Angy, panting with excitement as he saw\nthe moment of his triumph approaching. \"She was sold to the defendant\nand he had a legal right to her offspring. Can a man steal his own\nproperty, Your Honor? Most assuredly not! I wish to produce that cow in\nevidence and I will bring competent witnesses to prove that she belongs\nby rights to Pecos Dalhart. Bring in the exhibit, Mr. Todhunter!\"\n\nHe waved his hand toward the side door and as Kilkenny saw the _coup_\nwhich had been sprung on him he burst into a storm of protest. \"I\nobject, Your Honor!\" he shouted, \"I object!\"\n\n\"Objection overruled!\" pronounced the judge. \"Let the cow be brought in\nas quickly as possible and after the examination of the exhibit we will\nproceed at once to the argument.\"\n\nHe paused, and as the crowd that blocked the side door gave way before\nthe bailiffs, Old Funny-face was dragged unwillingly into court and\nled to the sand boat to join her calf. At the first sight of her\ndun-colored face and spotted neck every man in the jury-box looked at\nhis neighbor knowingly. They were cowmen, every one of them used to\npicking out mothers by hair-marks in the corral cut, and Old Funny-face\nwas a dead ringer for her calf. Even to the red blotch across his dun\nface the calf was the same, and when Funny-face indignantly repulsed\nits advances they were not deceived, for a cow soon forgets her\noffspring, once it is taken away. But most of all their trained eyes\ndwelt upon the mangled ears, the deep swallow fork in the left and the\nshort crop in the right, and the record of the brands on her side.\nThere was the broken arrow, just as Pecos had described it, and the\nvent mark on the shoulder. It would take some pretty stiff swearing\nto make them believe that that Spectacle brand on her ribs had not\nbeen burnt over a Monkey-wrench. It was Angy's inning now, and with a\nflourish he called Pecos to the stand and had him identify his cow; but\nwhen he called José Garcia, and José, gazing trustfully into Angy's\neyes, testified that she was his old milk cow and he had, _sin duda_,\nsold her to Pecos Dalhart for twenty-five dollars, the self-composed\nKilkenny began to rave with questions, while Crittenden broke into a\ncold sweat. Not only was the case going against him, but it threatened\nto leave him in the toils. It was too late to stop Garcia now—he had\nsaid his say and gone into a sullen silence—there was nothing for it\nbut to swear, and swear hard. Kilkenny was on his toes, swinging his\nclenched fist into the hollow of his hand and raging at the witness,\nwhen Crittenden suddenly dragged him down by the coat-tails and began\nto whisper into his ear. Instantly the district attorney was all\nattention; he asked a question, and then another; nodded, and addressed\nthe court.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he said, \"I will excuse the witness and ask to call\nothers in rebuttal. Will you take the chair, Mr. Crittenden!\"\n\nOld Crit advanced to the stand and faced the court-room, a savage gleam\nin his eye.\n\n\"Do you recognize this cow, Mr. Crittenden?\" inquired Kilkenny mildly.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I know her well. She's an old gentle cow that's been hangin'\naround my corral for years. I took her from Joe Garcia, last Spring,\nfor some money he was owin' me.\"\n\n\"What?\" yelled Angy, springing up from his chair, \"do you mean to say—\"\n\n\"I object, Your Honor!\" clamored Kilkenny desperately. \"I object! The\nwitness is mine!\"\n\n\"The People's witness,\" ruled the judge; \"let the examination proceed.\"\n\n\"Is this cow the mother of the calf in question—do you identify her as\nthe mother of this calf?\"\n\n\"I do!\" repeated Crittenden solemnly. \"And you can summon any of my\ncowboys—they'll swear to her.\"\n\n\"Take the witness!\" said Kilkenny, leering at Angevine Thorne, and in\nspite of all Angy could do Crit stuck to his story, word for word. One\nafter the other his cowboys took the chair, glanced at their boss, and\nidentified the cow and calf. Kilkenny had won, and before Babe Thorne\ncould collect his wits he plunged into his closing argument.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he cried, \"the people of Geronimo County are\nlooking to you to-day to vindicate justice in the courts. It is the\nshame of Geronimo County—spoken against her by all the world—that not\na single cattle-thief has ever been convicted in her courts. Men have\nbeen tried; their guilt has been demonstrated to a moral certainty; but\nthe evidence has been insufficient, and they have escaped. Gentlemen\nof the jury, a year and a half ago the defendant in this case came to\nGeronimo County without a cent; he went to work for Mr. Crittenden, who\nkindly took him in; but within a few months, gentlemen of the jury,\nPecos Dalhart left the service of his benefactor and moved to Lost Dog\nCañon. Six months later, gentlemen, when the sheriff at the risk of his\nlife rode into his guilty hiding-place, Mr. Dalhart had _two hundred\nhead of cattle_ shut up in a secret pasture! _Two—hundred—head_,\ngentlemen; and he defied the sheriff of this county _to even collect\nthe taxes_ upon those cattle! Gentlemen of the jury, I ask you, Where\ndid this man get those two hundred head of cattle? Did he bring them\nwith him? No, for the evidence shows that he rode in alone. Did he buy\nthem? No, for he had no money. Gentlemen of the jury, that man who sits\nbefore you _stole_ those cattle, and he does not dare to deny it!\"\n\nHe paused and looked about the court-room, and a great hush came upon\nthe entire assembly. Every man in the crowded standing room stood\nsilent and the surge of those without the doorway died down in a tremor\nof craning heads. Kilkenny had won—but he had not finished. Point by\npoint he went over the chain of his evidence, testing every link to\nprove that it was true, and then in a final outburst of frenzy he drove\nthe last point home.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, in closing, \"the defendant stands\nbefore you, convicted by his own words. He acknowledges that he\nbranded the calf; he acknowledges that he set at defiance all law\nand justice and robbed the man who had befriended him—and what is\nhis defence? That Isaac Crittenden had robbed him of his cow! Isaac\nCrittenden, who has cattle on a thousand hills! A man known, and\nfavorably known, in this community for twenty years! Gentlemen, I ask\nof you, whose word will you take in this matter? The word of this\nself-confessed cattle-rustler and his Mexican consort or the word of\nIsaac Crittenden of Verde Crossing? Gentlemen of the jury, it has\nbeen the shame of Geronimo County for many years that this practice\nof rustling cattle has never received its fitting rebuke. It has been\nthe shame of Arizona that the rights of the cattle men, the men who\ndared the Indians and braved the desert and made this country what\nit is, have never been protected. You have seen what this negligence\nhas brought to our near neighbor, Tonto County—a cattle war in\nwhich over fifty men have given up their lives; a beautiful cattle\ncountry, devastated of all its flocks and herds. It has brought death,\ngentlemen, and destruction of property, and—_bankruptcy_! Gentlemen, I\nask you for a verdict of 'Guilty'!\"\n\nHe sat down, and Angevine Thorne rose to his feet, bewildered. The\nspeech which he had prepared to save his friend was forgotten; the\nappeals which he could have made were dead. He gazed about the court\nand read in every eye the word that was still ringing in his ears:\n\"Guilty!\" And yet he knew that Pecos was not guilty. Cattle he had\nstolen, yes—but not the cattle in court. They, of all the animals he\nhad owned, had been honestly acquired; but Old Crit had sworn him into\nprison. It was right, perhaps, but it was not Law—and it was the law\nthat held him. As he looked at the forbidding faces before him, each\none hard and set by the false words of Crit and Shepherd Kilkenny, the\nmonstrous injustice of the thing rushed over him and he opened his\nlips to speak. It was a conspiracy—a hellish combination of lawyers\nand the men they served, to beat the poor man down. The old rage for\nthe revolution, the rage which he had put so resolutely from his\nheart, rushed back and choked him; he scowled at the sneering district\nattorney and Old Crit, humped over in his chair; and turned to the\nglowering audience, searching with the orator's instinct for a single\nfriendly face. But there was none; every man was against him—every one!\nHe raised his hand to heaven—and stopped. There was a struggle in the\ndoorway—a bailiff, tall and burly, was thrusting back a young girl who\nstruggled to get free—and then like a flash of light Babe Thorne saw\nher face, the wild-eyed, piteous face of Marcelina!\n\n\"Here!\" he commanded, leaping upon a chair and pointing with an\nimperious hand. \"Let that girl in! Your Honor, I demand that that girl\nbe let in! This trial is her trial, Your Honor—she is Marcelina Garcia,\nmy friend's affianced bride!\" In that single moment he saw it—the\nlast desperate chance to save his friend—a sentimental appeal to the\njury! How many men have been saved from prison and gallows and the\njust punishment of their crimes by such a ruse! Given the aged mother,\nthe despairing wife, the sweetheart, clinging to his hand, and all the\nthunderings of Jove will fail of conviction. The law and the evidence\nare nothing; Reason is dethroned and Justice tips her scales to send\nthe prisoner free. With a surly frown the bailiff let go his hold and\nlike a hunted creature that flees from the memory of her pursuers\nMarcelina ran panting down the aisle and threw herself at the feet of\nthe just judge.\n\n\"Oh, Meester,\" she cried, holding up her hands, \"do not send Paycos to\npreeson! Look, here are the ears of Old Funny-face, his cow, what Ol'\nCreet stole while he was gone! Paycos did not steal the cow—no, no! He\nbuy heem from my papa, and this is _mi padre's_ mark!\" She unwound the\nblue silk handkerchief that encased them and thrust into the hands of\nthe astounded judge—_two ears!_ With eager glances she held them up—the\nkeys which Old Crit had cut from Funny-face's ears on the day that he\nstole Pecos's herd—and thrust her brown finger through the Mexican\n_ventano_. Then, impatient of her English, she snatched them back and,\nscampering back to where Old Funny-face still stood on the sand boat,\nshe fitted the crop and swallow-fork back into the mangled ears.\n\n\"Look! Look!\" she cried, \"these are the dried-up ears what Ol' Creet\ncut from my Paycos's cow, that day when he stole his cattle. My leetle\nbrothers bring them from the corral to play with and I hide them, to\nshow to Paycos. Meester, he is bad man, that Creet! He—he—\"\n\nShe faltered and started back. There before her, humped over in his\nchair, sat Isaac Crittenden, and his one eye covered her like the evil\nglare of a rattlesnake.\n\n\"_Santa Maria!_\" she gasped. \"_Madre de Dios! Creet!_\" And with a\nscared sob she turned and ran to Babe. It was an affecting scene, but\nBabe did not overdo it.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he said, speaking over her bowed head with portentous\ncalm, \"I wish to offer these two ears in evidence as an exhibit in\nthis case. One of them, you will notice, is cut in a swallow-fork and\nexhibits, above, the _ventano_ which defendant testified belonged to\nthe mother of this calf; the other is cropped short and exhibits the\nslash and Mexican _anzuelo_; both of them show the peculiar red and\nwhite spots which gave to the cow in question the name of Funny-face.\nAfter the jury has inspected the exhibit I will ask that Marcelina\nGarcia be sworn.\"\n\nIt was not a long speech and had nothing of dramatic appeal; and yet\nas it came out, this was Angevine Thorne's closing speech. When he saw\nhow the pendulum had swung, Shepherd Kilkenny, the fighting district\nattorney, went into a black, frowning silence and refused to speak\nto Old Crit; but as the judge began his instructions to the jury\nhe suddenly roused up and beckoned to Boone Morgan. They whispered\ntogether while the law was being read and then the sheriff went over\nand spoke a few words to Pecos Dalhart.\n\n\"Sure!\" nodded Pecos, and at the signal Shepherd Kilkenny rose quickly\nto his feet.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" he said, bowing apologetically to the judge, \"in\nconsideration of the evidence which has just been introduced I wish to\nwithdraw my former request to the jury, and I now ask for a verdict\nof 'Not guilty.'\" He sat down, and a hum went up from the crowded\ncourt-room like the zooning of swarming bees. There was something\ncoming—something tremendous—that they all knew; and when the verdict\nwas given not a man moved from his place. Then Boone Morgan rose up\nfrom beside the district attorney and touched Isaac Crittenden on the\nshoulder. There was nothing rough about it, and Crittenden followed\nwithout a word, but the significance was plain. The man who had sworn\nothers into prison had done as much for himself, and it would take\na Philadelphia lawyer to turn him loose. He had sworn that the cow\nwas his, and the ear keys showed that he lied. Swallow-fork and crop,\nand Mexican marks above, and Old Funny-face, wagging her mangled ears\nin court! There had never been a cow-thief convicted in the Geronimo\ncourts, and Old Crit would spend every cent he had to keep out of jail,\nbut if Shepherd Kilkenny could not get him on evidence like that, then\ntyranny is dead and the devil has lost his claws.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nNEVER AGAIN\n\n\nThe District Court of Geronimo County broke up like a stampede of\ncattle when Ike Crittenden was placed under arrest, and in the general\nscramble Angevine Thorne was seized by a band of determined men and\nrushed to the Big Adobe bar. The committee on public entertainment had\nset their hearts on a speech, and they would not be denied. Meanwhile\nPecos Dalhart was borne off as inexorably in the other direction by\nBoone Morgan and Shepherd Kilkenny, and not until he had sworn to the\ncomplaint and testified against Old Crit before the J. P. would they\nlet him go his way. First on the programme which he had mapped out for\nhimself was a big feed at Hung Wo's restaurant, and Charley Hung Wo\nwas so happy over his release that he refused to accept a cent. That\nwas right friendly of Charley and shows what a good fellow a Chink can\nbe—give him a chance. It cheered Pecos up, and after he had got a new\noutfit of clothes all around and scoured the jail smell out of his skin\nhe began to feel like a white man again. The hot sunshine felt good\non his cheek, the wind smelled sweet, and he liked the clump of board\nsidewalks beneath his feet; but at the same time he was lonely. Somehow\nhe did not seem to fit into this great outer world any more—there was\nno place to go and nothing to do; that is, nothing but throw in with\nBabe Thorne and get drunk, and even that had its disadvantages.\n\nLighting a cigar and wandering down the street Pecos pondered upon the\nmatter and finally decided to hunt up Angy and see if anything could be\ndone. Taking advantage of the general preoccupation he managed to fight\nhis way through the crowded portals of the Big Adobe Saloon unobserved\nand there, surrounded by the heaving multitude, he stopped to listen. A\ncommittee of citizens had just presented Colonel Thorne with the keys\nof the town, appended to which as a further token of regard was a drink\ncheck on the Big Adobe—good for life. Mr. Thorne had evidently taken a\nfew of the drinks already and mellowed to the mood of his admirers; for\nwhen Pecos arrived he was midway in a flamboyant speech of declination.\n\n\"No, gentlemen,\" he was saying, \"much as I appreciate the honor\nconferred upon me by your kind invitation, I can never accept the\nnomination for such an office. What, shall men say in times to come\nthat Angevine Thorne, after freeing his friend from the clutches of\nthe law, turned traitor to the common people and became the district\nattorney? Never! Nay, if I were prosecuting attorney I would prosecute\nthe judge and the jury, the rich corporations and cattle kings, and\nall who make the law a scourge for the poor and lowly. Never, never,\nnever, shall the word go forth—\"\n\nThat was enough for Pecos—he saw that he was not needed. True, he had\npromised Angy a drink from which Geronimo should date time, but the\ncitizens' committee had taken all that off his hands. Pulling his\nhat down over his eyes he struggled out into the deserted street and\nlooked around like a lost dog—then with a sigh he turned and made his\nway back to the jail. It was the only home he had now. On one shoulder\nhe bore a box of apples—a last gift for the boys inside—and as he\nstepped in through the sliding doors and saw them come swarming out\nfrom their cells to greet him he regarded them almost with affection.\nFor six months he had been alcalde in that jail, laying down the law\nwith fist and strap, and now he must resign. As his sheriff attended\nto the distribution of the fruit Pecos stepped into his little cell,\nshoved the worn Bible into his pocket and got his strap; then, after\na hurried word with Boone Morgan through the bars, he mounted on the\nalcalde's chair and addressed them.\n\n\"Boys,\" he said, \"luck come my way and I'm goin' to leave you. You'll\nhave to have a new alcalde now and I only ask one thing before I go.\nThey're goin' to throw a big, tall, hump-backed dastard in here pretty\nsoon. He's only got one eye, but he's got lots of money and I want\nyou to kangaroo him to the limit, and give him _this_ for contempt of\ncourt!\" He raised the broad strap in the air. \"Will you do it?\" he\nyelled, and when they answered with a roar he hurled it into their\nmidst.\n\n\"All right then; fight for it, you tarriers!\" he shouted, \"_and the one\nthat gits it is alcalde_!\"\n\nThey fought, and when it was over Pecos Dalhart stepped out of jail, a\nfree man. It is a fine thing to be free, but freedom carries with it\ncertain obligations, one of which is to keep out of jail. Pecos glanced\ninto the jag-cell in passing and decided not to get drunk, at any\nrate. Then he went down to the office with Boone Morgan.\n\n\"Well, Pecos,\" said that genial official, shaking out a bunch of keys,\n\"you might as well take your property envelope and what money you got\nleft—unless you expect to be back soon,\" he hinted. \"By the way, what\nyou goin' to do after you sober up?\"\n\n\"Well, I dunno,\" said Pecos, scratching his head. \"I could go back up\non the Verde, now Old Crit's in jail, and burn them Spectacle cows he\nstole off of me back into a Hock-sign—two bars and another circle would\nmake a three-ball sign, all right—but I've quit that line of business.\nLook at Crit!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" grunted the sheriff, \"think you'll quit rustlin', eh? But say,\nhow come you ain't drunk already? I had a little business I wanted to\ntalk over with you, but I thought I'd better wait till you blew off.\"\n\n\"Nope, no more booze for me!\" declared Pecos virtuously. \"You fellers\nnever git me in _here_ no more. You come so dam' near sendin' me to\nYuma for somethin' I never done that I'm goin' to be mighty careful\nwhat I _do_!\" He paused and gazed sombrely out of the window and a new\ncourage—the courage of clean clothes and freedom—drew him on to speak.\n\"This is a hell of a thing you call the law,\" he observed, \"now ain't\nit? How much of a show does a poor man git in your courts with Shepherd\nKilkenny ravin' for his life? I'm goin' to git on a good horse and\nride, and ride, and ride, until I git away from that dastard; that's\nwhat I'm goin' to do!\"\n\nThe sheriff had laid out the familiar property envelope and was\ntwirling the combination of his safe, but at this last outburst he\nstopped short.\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the kind,\" he said shortly. \"I been tryin' for\ntwo years to get Ike Crittenden for stealing cows, and I want you to\nstay in Geronimo County until we get him _cinched_! Are you goin' to do\nit?\"\n\nFor an instant Pecos met his eye defiantly; then the memory of other\ncows that he _had_ stolen rose up in his mind and he nodded his head.\n\n\"Sure!\" he said, \"I'll be your star witness.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" grumbled the sheriff, turning morosely away from his\nsafe, \"but bein' as you seem to be making medicine against the law\nagain I jest want to ask you a few questions. You say the law is a hell\nof a thing—and it is; I admit it. And the poor man don't have no show\nagainst it—that's a fact, too. But here's what I want to know—what you\ngoin' to do about it? How long do you think it will take to change\nthe law so a poor man will have an even break with a rich one, the\nway things are goin'? 'Bout a thousand years, hey? Well, I call that\nconservative. But say, do you expect to live that long? No? Think you\ncan hurry it up any by buckin' against the law? Well, what you goin' to\ndo about it—spend your time in jail?\"\n\n\"Well, it ain't right,\" muttered Pecos, \"that's all I got to say. Jest\nlook at your dam' law!\" he cried, the memory of his wrongs getting the\nbetter of him; \"look at _me_! Kep' six months in jail before I could\ngit a trial—d' you call that right?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" said Boone Morgan calmly, \"but what you goin' to do about it?\nI mean _you_, now! D' you think you can mend matters any by gettin'\nthrown into jail? I got my eye on you, and that's just where you'll\nland. Sure, the law is rotten, but what you goin' to _do_ about it?\"\n\nThe coldblooded insistence of the man jangled on Pecos's nerves and\nmade him pass it back.\n\n\"Well, what _can_ a feller do?\" he demanded savagely.\n\n\"Keep out of trouble—don't break the law—that's all!\" rumbled the\nsheriff, fixing him with his masterful eyes. He turned slowly back to\nthe combination of his safe, twirling the tumblers while the wisdom of\nhis words went home; then he threw open the door, drew out a large\nofficial envelope, and balanced it in his hand. \"Well,\" he challenged,\nlooking Pecos in the eye, \"ain't that right?\"\n\nPecos pondered upon it a minute longer, much as he had studied on\nCrit's proposition that it is no crime to rob a thief, and right there\nthe cause of the revolution lost another fervent disciple.\n\n\"By God, Boone,\" he said, \"I believe you're right!\"\n\n\"W'y, of course I'm right!\" cried Morgan, slapping him jovially on the\nback; \"and there's a thousand dollars to prove it!\"\n\nHe tore open the official envelope and thrust a sheaf of bills into the\nastonished cowboy's hands.\n\n\"Money talks,\" he observed sententiously, \"only there're some people\nhave such a roarin' in the ears they can't hear it. This roll of\nvelvet is what's left from the tax sale of those Monkey-wrench cows I\nseized, and it says that you are a capitalist, with all the errors and\nprejudices of your class. Just put that into cows now, and look after\n'em, and you'll forget all about the revolution.\"\n\n\"Hell's fire!\" ejaculated Pecos, shutting down on the money. \"You don't\nmean to say this is all mine?\"\n\n\"That's right. I tried to give it to you last Fall, up there at Verde\nCrossing, but you heard the wind in your ears, clean to New Mexico.\nGuess your conscience was kind of troublin' you, hey?\"\n\n\"Umm,\" answered Pecos absently. He was studying on how to spend his\nmoney. For several minutes he sat thumbing over the new bills and\ngazing out into the twilight; then he jammed them deep into his pocket\nand started for the door.\n\n\"Hey! Where you goin'?\" shouted Boone Morgan, as he clattered down the\nsteps. \"Come back here and get this property envelope! You must've had\nan idee,\" he ventured, as Pecos reappeared.\n\n\"Yep,\" said Pecos, \"an' a good one.\" He dumped the contents of his\nenvelope on top of the desk and regarded the articles fixedly. There,\nsparkling brightly as when he first bought it, was the eighteen-carat,\nsolitaire-diamond engagement-ring.\n\n\"That ought to come in pretty handy now,\" suggested the sheriff,\npointing to it with the butt of his cigar.\n\n\"Nope,\" replied Pecos noncommittally, \"too late now.\"\n\n\"That's bad,\" commented Boone Morgan sociably. \"Mighty pretty girl,\ntoo. All off, hey?\"\n\nPecos looked him over carefully, grunted, and started for the door.\n\nIt would be difficult to tell just how it happened so, but as Pecos\nDalhart, with a firm resolve in his heart, dashed down the steps once\nmore, his eye caught a darker shadow in the dusky corner of the jail\nand he stopped dead in his tracks. Then as his vision became adjusted\nto the twilight he walked slowly over toward the corner, where a\nwoman's figure was crouched against the wall. It was Marcelina, worn,\ndraggled, and tear-stained, and as she gazed up at him from beneath her\ntangled hair his heart stopped in its beat.\n\n\"Ah, Paycos,\" she murmured brokenly, \"where can I go? The seesters\nlock me up in hi-igh room, for run away to see you. Two day I cry\n_todo-tiempo_ because you no have ears—then I jump out of window to\nbreeng them. Now I can not go home. An', Paycos,\" she rose up suddenly\nand moved toward him, \"I am 'fraid! I am 'fraid Ol' Creet will catch\nme!\"\n\n\"Crit nothin'!\" said Pecos scornfully. \"Come on over here—what's the\nmatter with you?\" He gathered her into his arms and held her close a\nminute.\n\n\"You ain't scairt now, are you?\" he inquired tenderly.\n\n\"A-ah, no!\" sighed Marcelina, nestling against his breast.\n\n\"Well, gimme that kiss, then,\" said Pecos.\n\nThere were no wedding bells at Pecos Dalhart's marriage—that takes too\nmuch time—but the county clerk gave him a license right away, Boone\nMorgan went along for a witness, and the J. P. did the rest. It was\nthe same J. P. who had held Pecos for cattle-rustling, but what of\nthat? Upon such an occasion the past is forgotten and we care little\nwhat hand it is that confers our greatest happiness. Pecos pressed a\nten-dollar bill into the guilt-stained palm of the magistrate and then,\nwhile his roll was out, he peeled off another bill and handed it to\nBoone Morgan.\n\n\"Give that to Angy when he comes to,\" he said, \"and tell 'im to hunt\nme up. Don't know where we'll live yet, but it wouldn't be like home\nwithout old Babe—would it, Marcelina?\"\n\n\"Ah, Paycos,\" breathed Marcelina, gazing up at him with adoring eyes,\n\"you are such a _goo-ood_ man!\"\n\nThe rustler glanced doubtfully over his shoulder at Boone Morgan,\ngrinned, and passed out into the starlit night.\n\n\"All right, Chiquita,\" he said. \"You got a monopoly on that idee—but\nwhatever you say, goes!\"\n\n\n\n\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n  |                                                                   |\n  | Transcriber's note:                                               |\n  |                                                                   |\n  | Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.      |\n  |                                                                   |\n  | Word combinations that appeared with and without hyphens were     |\n  | changed to the predominant form if it could be determined, or to  |\n  | the hyphenated form if it could not.                              |\n  |                                                                   |\n  | Mid-paragraph illustrations have been moved between paragraphs    |\n  | and some illustrations have been moved closer to the text that    |\n  | references them.
