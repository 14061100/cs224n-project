{"summary": "Miguel de Cervantes said that the first chapters are taken from \"The Archive of La Mancha\" and the rest translated from the Arabic from the Moorish author Cide Hamete Benengeli. This metafictional trick appears to be designed to give a greater credibility to the text, by implying that Don Quixote is a real character and that the story truly occurred several decades back.\n\n\nAlonso Quixano, the protagonist of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing fifty years of age, living in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper, as well as a boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a rational man, his reading in excess of books of chivalry has produced the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties. In keeping with the humoral theory of the time, not sleeping adequately — because he was reading — has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus choleric, the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger and believes every word of these fictional books of chivalry to be true.\nImitating the protagonists of these books, he decides to become a knight-errant in search of adventure. To these ends, he dons an old suit of armour, renames himself \"Don Quixote\", names his exhausted horse \"Rocinante\", and designates Aldonza Lorenzo, a neighboring farm girl, as his lady love, renaming her Dulcinea del Toboso, while she knows nothing of this. Expecting to become famous quickly, he arrives at an inn, which he believes to be a castle; calls the prostitutes he meets \"ladies\" (doncellas); and asks the innkeeper, whom he takes as the lord of the castle, to dub him a knight. He spends the night holding vigil over his armor, and becomes involved in a fight with muleteers who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. In a pretended ceremony, the innkeeper dubs him a knight to be rid of him, and sends him on his way.\nDon Quixote next \"frees\" a young boy tied to a tree and beaten by his master, and makes his master swear to treat the boy fairly; but the boy's beating is continued as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote then encounters traders from Toledo, who \"insult\" the imaginary Dulcinea. He attacks them, only to be severely beaten and left on the side of the road, and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant.\n\nWhile Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish curate and the local barber burn most of his chivalric and other books. A large part of this section consists of the priest deciding which books deserve to be burned and which to be saved. This gives occasion for many comments on books Cervantes liked and disliked. For example, Cervantes' own pastoral novel La Galatea is saved, while the rather unbelievable romance Felixmarte de Hyrcania is burned. After the books are dealt with, they seal up the room which contained the library, later telling Don Quixote that it was the action of a wizard (encantador).\n\nAfter a short period of feigning health, Don Quixote requests his neighbor, Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising him governorship of an island, or insula. Sancho, who is both greedy and unintelligent, agrees to the offer and sneaks away with Don Quixote in the early dawn. It is here that their famous adventures begin, starting with Don Quixote's attack on windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants.\nThe two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage. Don Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive, knocks a friar from his horse, and is immediately challenged by an armed Basque traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. Cervantes chooses this point, in the middle of the battle, to say that his source ends here. Soon, however, he resumes Don Quixote's adventures after a story about finding Arabic notebooks containing the rest of the story by Cid Hamet Ben Engeli. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to \"surrender\" to Don Quixote.\n\nSancho and Don Quixote fall in with a group of goatherders. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goatherders about the \"Golden Age\" of man, in which property does not exist and men live in peace. The goatherders invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of Grisóstomo, once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading pastoral novels (paralleling Don Quixote's decision to become a knight), seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears, vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Grisóstomo, and claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations put on her by pastoral clichés. She disappears into the woods, and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up, the two dismount by a pond to rest. Some Galicians arrive to water their ponies, and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, whereupon Don Quixote tries to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho, leaving them in great pain.\n\nAfter escaping the muleteers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride to a nearby inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Maritornes, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his bed with him, scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls \"the balm of Fierarbras\", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following the example of the fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.\n\nAfter Don Quixote frees a group of galley slaves, he and Sancho wander into the Sierra Morena, and there encounter the dejected Cardenio. Cardenio relates the first part of his story, in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Luscinda, and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son, leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son, Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Luscinda and the delays in their engagement, caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Luscinda, Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in chivalric novels.\n\nIn the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goatherders, soldiers, priests, escaped convicts and scorned lovers. The aforementioned characters sometimes tell tales that incorporate events from the real world, like the conquest of the Kingdom of Maynila or battles in the Eighty Years' War. Their encounters are magnified by Don Quixote's imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixote's tendency to intervene violently in matters irrelevant to himself, and his habit of not paying debts, result in privations, injuries and humiliations (with Sancho often the victim). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The narrator hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.\n\n\nAlthough the two parts are now published as a single work, Don Quixote, Part Two was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While Part One was mostly farcical, the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception.\nAs Part Two begins, it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the story. Cervantes's meta-fictional device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published, fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests. Pressed into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three ragged peasant girls, and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends (reversing some incidents of Part One) that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment.\nSancho later gets his comeuppance for this when, as part of one of the Duke and Duchess's pranks, the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself three thousand lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the Duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false; and he proves to be a wise and practical ruler; though this ends in humiliation as well. Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity.\nThe lengthy untold \"history\" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon (a young man from Don Quixote's hometown who had previously posed as the Knight of Mirrors) on the beach in Barcelona, in which the reader finds him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror: here, it is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (in which he may be cured of his madness).\nUpon returning to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside as a shepherd, but his housekeeper urges him to stay home. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, and later awakes from a dream, having fully recovered his sanity. Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Quixano (his proper name) only renounces his previous ambition and apologizes for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate, and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.\nPart Two of Don Quixote explores the concept of a character understanding that he is written about: an idea much explored in the 20th century.\n\n", "full_text": "DON QUIXOTE\n\nComplete\n\nby Miguel de Cervantes [Saavedra]\n\nTranslated

TRANSLATION\n\nIt was with considerable reluctance that I abandoned in favour of the\npresent undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of a new\nedition of Shelton's \"Don Quixote,\" which has now become a somewhat\nscarce book. There are some--and I confess myself to be one--for whom\nShelton's racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no\nmodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton\nhad the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as\nCervantes; \"Don Quixote\" had to him a vitality that only a contemporary\ncould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes saw\nthem; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish of\nCervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most\nlikely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his\nsaddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under the\nmulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its\npages.\n\nBut it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate\npopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, no\ndoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority. His\nwarmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representative\nof Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very hastily made and\nwas never revised by him. It has all the freshness and vigour, but also a\nfull measure of the faults, of a hasty production. It is often very\nliteral--barbarously literal frequently--but just as often very loose. He\nhad evidently a good colloquial knowledge of Spanish, but apparently not\nmuch more. It never seems to occur to him that the same translation of a\nword will not suit in every case.\n\nIt is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of \"Don\nQuixote.\" To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of\ntruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly\nsatisfactory translation of \"Don Quixote\" into English or any other\nlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable,\nor that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no doubt, are so\nsuperabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness to which the\nhumour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spanish, and can at\nbest be only distantly imitated in any other tongue.\n\nThe history of our English translations of \"Don Quixote\" is instructive.\nShelton's, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608,\nbut not published till 1612. This of course was only the First Part. It\nhas been asserted that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work of\nShelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that\nit has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by \"go,\" about\nit than the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work\nof a young man writing currente calamo, and the second that of a\nmiddle-aged man writing for a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer\nand more literal, the style is the same, the very same translations, or\nmistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new\ntranslator would, by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry\noff the credit.\n\nIn 1687 John Phillips, Milton's nephew, produced a \"Don Quixote\" \"made\nEnglish,\" he says, \"according to the humour of our modern language.\" His\n\"Quixote\" is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty that\nfor coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in\nthe literature of that day.\n\nNed Ward's \"Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily\ntranslated into Hudibrastic Verse\" (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a\ntranslation, but it serves to show the light in which \"Don Quixote\" was\nregarded at the time.\n\nA further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by\nPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with\nliterature. It is described as \"translated from the original by several\nhands,\" but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the\nmanipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the other\nhand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it carefully with\nthe original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton\nand the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings from\nPhillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It is, to be sure, more\ndecent and decorous, but it treats \"Don Quixote\" in the same fashion as a\ncomic book that cannot be made too comic.\n\nTo attempt to improve the humour of \"Don Quixote\" by an infusion of\ncockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux's operators did, is not\nmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an\nabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of\nthe uncritical way in which \"Don Quixote\" is generally read that this\nworse than worthless translation--worthless as failing to represent,\nworse than worthless as misrepresenting--should have been favoured as it\nhas been.\n\nIt had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken and\nexecuted in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portrait\npainter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas has been\nallowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said none, for it is\nknown to the world in general as Jarvis's. It was not published until\nafter his death, and the printers gave the name according to the current\npronunciation of the day. It has been the most freely used and the most\nfreely abused of all the translations. It has seen far more editions than\nany other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful,\nand yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author.\nJervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface, where\namong many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and\nunjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, but\nfrom the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten\nyears after Shelton's first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too,\nseems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and\na mediocre one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of\nSwift), and this may have been strengthened by Pope's remark that he\n\"translated 'Don Quixote' without understanding Spanish.\" He has been\nalso charged with borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true\nthat in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and\ngone astray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty\nwhere he is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope's dictum, anyone who\nexamines Jervas's version carefully, side by side with the original, will\nsee that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than\nShelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in fact, an\nhonest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left a version\nwhich, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors\nand mistranslations.\n\nThe charge against it is that it is stiff, dry--\"wooden\" in a word,-and\nno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be pleaded\nfor Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of\nthe light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He was one of the\nfew, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of the\nunsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed to\nhim a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own\ngood things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic\nabstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the\ncharacteristic of his translation. In most modern editions, it should be\nobserved, his style has been smoothed and smartened, but without any\nreference to the original Spanish, so that if he has been made to read\nmore agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity.\n\nSmollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of\nthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas's\ntranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no\nheed given to the original Spanish.\n\nThe later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly's,\nwhich appeared in 1769, \"printed for the Translator,\" was an impudent\nimposture, being nothing more than Motteux's version with a few of the\nwords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot's (1774) was\nonly an abridgment like Florian's, but not so skilfully executed; and the\nversion published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother's\nplates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former\ntranslations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield's, it would be in every\nsense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not\neven seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since\nthen I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the\ntemptation which Mr. Duffield's reputation and comely volumes hold out to\nevery lover of Cervantes.\n\nFrom the foregoing history of our translations of \"Don Quixote,\" it will\nbe seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere\nnarrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures\nserved up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether\nthat form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On\nthe other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not\nmerely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least\nas differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a\npreference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have\nacquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.\n\nBut after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there\nis no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why\na translator who makes it his aim to treat \"Don Quixote\" with the respect\ndue to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless\nreader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a\nquestion of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with\nhim who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the\nSpanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the\ngreat majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers\nto whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much\na part of the translator's duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can\nplease all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those\nwho look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is\nin his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is\npracticable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.\n\nMy purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to\nindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my\nability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,\ncannot be too rigidly followed in translating \"Don Quixote,\" is to avoid\neverything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in\none sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than\nCervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or\nobsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and\none for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably\nundergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in\nEurope, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of \"Don\nQuixote\" differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of\nthe present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote's speeches, the\ntranslator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will\nalmost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original.\n\nSeeing that the story of \"Don Quixote\" and all its characters and\nincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar\nas household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old\nfamiliar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of\ncourse a translator who holds that \"Don Quixote\" should receive the\ntreatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the\ninjunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything.\n\nII: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE\n\nFour generations had laughed over \"Don Quixote\" before it occurred to\nanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes\nSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a\nsatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of\nthe author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret's instance in\n1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time\ndisappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed,\ntransmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of\nother record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nwere incurious as to \"the men of the time,\" a reproach against which the\nnineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no\nShakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was\nentrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or\nNavarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to\nhimself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence\nbearing upon his life as they could find.\n\nThis, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good\npurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the\nchief characteristic of Navarrete's work. Besides sifting, testing, and\nmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously\nbrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under\nwhich anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.\nNavarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no\nfault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of\nShakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: \"It\nis not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the\northography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no record\nof his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a contemporary has\nbeen produced.\"\n\nIt is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced\nto make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture,\nand that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the\nplace of established fact. All that I propose to do here is to separate\nwhat is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture, and leave it to\nthe reader's judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or\nnot.\n\nThe men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of Spanish\nliterature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon, Garcilaso de la\nVega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient families, and,\ncuriously, all, except the last, of families that traced their origin to\nthe same mountain district in the North of Spain. The family of Cervantes\nis commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably it\nwas in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I think\nthe balance of the evidence tends to show that the \"solar,\" the original\nsite of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of Old\nCastile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias. As it\nhappens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the\ntenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of\n\"Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous\nNuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\" written in 1648 by the industrious\ngenealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscript\ngenealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of John\nII.\n\nThe origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost as\ndistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso\nVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, and\nwas rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo. On\none of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he built\nhimself a castle which he called Cervatos, because \"he was lord of the\nsolar of Cervatos in the Montana,\" as the mountain region extending from\nthe Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At his death in battle in\n1143, the castle passed by his will to his son Alfonso Munio, who, as\nterritorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the\nsimple patronymic, took the additional name of Cervatos. His eldest son\nPedro succeeded him in the possession of the castle, and followed his\nexample in adopting the name, an assumption at which the younger son,\nGonzalo, seems to have taken umbrage.\n\nEveryone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember the\nruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of\nAlcantara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline and\ncrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid\nAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It was built,\nor as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his occupation of\nToledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after a Spanish martyr, a\nname subsequently modified into San Servan (in which form it appears in\nthe \"Poem of the Cid\"), San Servantes, and San Cervantes: with regard to\nwhich last the \"Handbook for Spain\" warns its readers against the\nsupposition that it has anything to do with the author of \"Don Quixote.\"\nFord, as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on\nthe roads of Spain, is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history.\nIn this instance, however, he is in error. It has everything to do with\nthe author of \"Don Quixote,\" for it is in fact these old walls that have\ngiven to Spain the name she is proudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above\nmentioned, it may be readily conceived, did not relish the appropriation\nby his brother of a name to which he himself had an equal right, for\nthough nominally taken from the castle, it was in reality derived from\nthe ancient territorial possession of the family, and as a set-off, and\nto distinguish himself (diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a\nsurname the name of the castle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building\nof which, according to a family tradition, his great-grandfather had a\nshare.\n\nBoth brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;\nit sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galicia,\nand Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the\nservice of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently a son of\nhis, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48 that gave\nCordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the Moors in the\nkingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried with some of the\nnoblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among them soldiers,\nmagistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least two\ncardinal-archbishops.\n\nOf the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander of\nthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias\nde Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,\nCorregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches of\nthe family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Dona Leonor de\nCortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and\nMiguel, our author.\n\nThe pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on \"Don Quixote.\" A\nman who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errant\nextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada was\nlikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of\nthe romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than one\nplace about families that have once been great and have tapered away\nuntil they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of his\nown.\n\nHe was born at Alcala de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa\nMaria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth we know\nnothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his\n\"Comedies\" of himself as a boy looking on with delight while Lope de\nRueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and\nacted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of\nhis interludes. This first glimpse, however, is a significant one, for it\nshows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised\nsuch an influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grew\nolder, and of which this very preface, written only a few months before\nhis death, is such a striking proof. He gives us to understand, too, that\nhe was a great reader in his youth; but of this no assurance was needed,\nfor the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" alone proves a vast amount of\nmiscellaneous reading, romances of chivalry, ballads, popular poetry,\nchronicles, for which he had no time or opportunity except in the first\ntwenty years of his life; and his misquotations and mistakes in matters\nof detail are always, it may be noticed, those of a man recalling the\nreading of his boyhood.\n\nOther things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was a\nboy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period for\nSpain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain was the\nmightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it had not\nyet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By the policy of\nFerdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute, and the\nChurch and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. The nobles, who\nhad always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the\nMoors, had been divested of all political power, a like fate had befallen\nthe cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon had been swept\naway, and the only function that remained to the Cortes was that of\ngranting money at the King's dictation.\n\nThe transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la Vega\nand Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had brought back\nfrom Italy the products of the post-Renaissance literature, which took\nroot and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths.\nDamon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had been fairly naturalised in\nSpain, together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing\nwith an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible\nshepherdess. As a set-off against this, the old historical and\ntraditional ballads, and the true pastorals, the songs and ballads of\npeasant life, were being collected assiduously and printed in the\ncancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity. But the\nmost notable consequence, perhaps, of the spread of printing was the\nflood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press\never since Garci Ordonez de Montalvo had resuscitated \"Amadis of Gaul\" at\nthe beginning of the century.\n\nFor a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no\nbetter spot in Spain than Alcala de Henares in the middle of the\nsixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,\nsomething more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether a\nvery different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcala the\ntraveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and\nmedicine may have been the strong points of the university, but the town\nitself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light\nliterature, and as a producer of books Alcala was already beginning to\ncompete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and Seville.\n\nA pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoings\nmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcala at that\ntime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where\nthe latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,\nwhat that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,\nthat called itself \"Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,\"\ncould be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one\nof those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous panoply\nand plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to\nembellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father of\nthe man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively\nat ten, and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis\nof \"Don Quixote.\"\n\nFor his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But why\nRodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son to a\nuniversity a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own\ndoor, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he did\nso. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez,\nthat he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de\nCervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again; but even if\nit had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there\nwere at least two other Miguels born about the middle of the century; one\nof them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a\nsource of great embarrassment to the biographers.\n\nThat he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best proved\nby his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,\nand he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life-for the\n\"Tia Fingida,\" if it be his, is not one--nothing, not even \"a college\njoke,\" to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. All\nthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de Hoyos,\na professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence, calls him\nhis \"dear and beloved pupil.\" This was in a little collection of verses\nby different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second queen of\nPhilip II, published by the professor in 1569, to which Cervantes\ncontributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph in the form\nof a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a \"Lycidas\" finds its way\ninto a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton. His verses are\nno worse than such things usually are; so much, at least, may be said for\nthem.\n\nBy the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate ordered it,\nfor twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio, afterwards\nCardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to Philip II by the\nPope on a mission, partly of condolence, partly political, and on his\nreturn to Rome, which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the King, he\ntook Cervantes with him as his camarero (chamberlain), the office he\nhimself held in the Pope's household. The post would no doubt have led to\nadvancement at the Papal Court had Cervantes retained it, but in the\nsummer of 1570 he resigned it and enlisted as a private soldier in\nCaptain Diego Urbina's company, belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada's\nregiment, but at that time forming a part of the command of Marc Antony\nColonna. What impelled him to this step we know not, whether it was\ndistaste for the career before him, or purely military enthusiasm. It may\nwell have been the latter, for it was a stirring time; the events,\nhowever, which led to the alliance between Spain, Venice, and the Pope,\nagainst the common enemy, the Porte, and to the victory of the combined\nfleets at Lepanto, belong rather to the history of Europe than to the\nlife of Cervantes. He was one of those that sailed from Messina, in\nSeptember 1571, under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the\nmorning of the 7th of October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was\nlying below ill with fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he\nrose, and, in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors,\ninsisted on taking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of\nGod and the King to health. His galley, the Marquesa, was in the thick of\nthe fight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds,\ntwo in the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after\nthe battle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with the\ncommander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of the\nwounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his pay,\nand another, apparently, the friendship of his general.\n\nHow severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that\nwith youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament\nas ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before he\nwas discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled; he\nhad lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the \"Viaje del Parnaso\"\nfor the greater glory of the right. This, however, did not absolutely\nunfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel Ponce de Leon's\ncompany of Lope de Figueroa's regiment, in which, it seems probable, his\nbrother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the operations of the next\nthree years, including the capture of the Goletta and Tunis. Taking\nadvantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the\nTurks, he obtained leave to return to Spain, and sailed from Naples in\nSeptember 1575 on board the Sun galley, in company with his brother\nRodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada, late Governor of the Goletta, and\nsome others, and furnished with letters from Don John of Austria and the\nDuke of Sesa, the Viceroy of Sicily, recommending him to the King for the\ncommand of a company, on account of his services; a dono infelice as\nevents proved. On the 26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine\ngalleys, and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into\nAlgiers.\n\nBy means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform\ntheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcala at once\nstrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he\npossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But\nDali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by Don\nJohn and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a\nperson of great consequence, when the money came he refused it scornfully\nas being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo, however, was more\neasily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case, and it was arranged\nbetween the brothers that he should return to Spain and procure a vessel\nin which he was to come back to Algiers and take off Miguel and as many\nof their comrades as possible. This was not the first attempt to escape\nthat Cervantes had made. Soon after the commencement of his captivity he\ninduced several of his companions to join him in trying to reach Oran,\nthen a Spanish post, on foot; but after the first day's journey, the Moor\nwho had agreed to act as their guide deserted them, and they had no\nchoice but to return. The second attempt was more disastrous. In a garden\noutside the city on the sea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the\ngardener, a Spaniard, a hiding-place, to which he brought, one by one,\nfourteen of his fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for\nseveral months, and supplying them with food through a renegade known as\nEl Dorador, \"the Gilder.\" How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all\nthis, is one of the mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may\nappear, it was very nearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo\nmade its appearance off the coast, and under cover of night was\nproceeding to take off the refugees, when the crew were alarmed by a\npassing fishing boat, and beat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt\nshortly afterwards, they, or a portion of them at least, were taken\nprisoners, and just as the poor fellows in the garden were exulting in\nthe thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their\ngrasp, they found themselves surrounded by Turkish troops, horse and\nfoot. The Dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.\n\nWhen Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions to\nlay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared\naloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else had\nany share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was\nthreatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and\nnoses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived what\ntheir tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from his\noriginal statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshot was\nthat the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and the prisoners\ntaken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of\nthem to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crowns\nfor him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, and\ndaring, was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private\nhands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison. If he\nthought that by these means he could break the spirit or shake the\nresolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived, for Cervantes\ncontrived before long to despatch a letter to the Governor of Oran,\nentreating him to send him some one that could be trusted, to enable him\nand three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of his, to make their escape;\nintending evidently to renew his first attempt with a more trustworthy\nguide. Unfortunately the Moor who carried the letter was stopped just\noutside Oran, and the letter being found upon him, he was sent back to\nAlgiers, where by the order of the Dey he was promptly impaled as a\nwarning to others, while Cervantes was condemned to receive two thousand\nblows of the stick, a number which most likely would have deprived the\nworld of \"Don Quixote,\" had not some persons, who they were we know not,\ninterceded on his behalf.\n\nAfter this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than\nbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt. This\ntime his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade and two\nValencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in which he and\nabout sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just\nas they were about to put it into execution one Doctor Juan Blanco de\nPaz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey of the plot.\nCervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, by his untiring\nenergy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery,\nhad endeared himself to all, and become the leading spirit in the captive\ncolony, and, incredible as it may seem, jealousy of his influence and the\nesteem in which he was held, moved this man to compass his destruction by\na cruel death. The merchants finding that the Dey knew all, and fearing\nthat Cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil\ntheir own lives, tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel\nthat was on the point of sailing for Spain; but he told them they had\nnothing to fear, for no tortures would make him compromise anybody, and\nhe went at once and gave himself up to the Dey.\n\nAs before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices. Everything\nwas made ready for his immediate execution; the halter was put round his\nneck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could be got from him\nwas that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen who had since left\nAlgiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who were to accompany\nhim were not to know anything of it until the last moment. Finding he\ncould make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back to prison more heavily\nironed than before.\n\nThe poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying once\nmore to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred ducats\nwas got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan Gil, who\nwas about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded more than\ndouble the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired and he was\nabout to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves with him, the\ncase of Cervantes was critical. He was already on board heavily ironed,\nwhen the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and\nFather Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September\n19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was\nat last set free. Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who\nclaimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false\nevidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return\nto Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five\nquestions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he\nrequested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before\na notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in\nAlgiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more\nbesides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and\ngratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of\nthe notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of\nCervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up\ntheir drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent,\nand how \"in him this deponent found father and mother.\"\n\nOn his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for\nPortugal to support Philip's claim to the crown, and utterly penniless\nnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to the\nAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war\nreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the manuscript\nof his pastoral romance, the \"Galatea,\" and probably also, to judge by\ninternal evidence, that of the first portion of \"Persiles and\nSigismunda.\" He also brought back with him, his biographers assert, an\ninfant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great\ncircumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose\nname, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, they omit to\nmention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly\nwas living in the family of Cervantes a Dona Isabel de Saavedra, who is\ndescribed in an official document as his natural daughter, and then\ntwenty years of age.\n\nWith his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now that\nDon John was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services, and\nfor a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; he\nhad already a certain reputation as a poet; he made up his mind,\ntherefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for a first venture\ncommitted his \"Galatea\" to the press. It was published, as Salva y Mallen\nshows conclusively, at Alcala, his own birth-place, in 1585 and no doubt\nhelped to make his name more widely known, but certainly did not do him\nmuch good in any other way.\n\nWhile it was going through the press, he married Dona Catalina de\nPalacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, and\napparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which may\npossibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, that was\nall. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages and\nstrolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turned to\nit for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twenty or\nthirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwing of\ncucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without any hisses,\noutcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were not bad enough\nto be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to hold their own upon\nit. Only two of them have been preserved, but as they happen to be two of\nthe seven or eight he mentions with complacency, we may assume they are\nfavourable specimens, and no one who reads the \"Numancia\" and the \"Trato\nde Argel\" will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas.\nWhatever merits they may have, whatever occasional they may show, they\nare, as regards construction, incurably clumsy. How completely they\nfailed is manifest from the fact that with all his sanguine temperament\nand indomitable perseverance he was unable to maintain the struggle to\ngain a livelihood as a dramatist for more than three years; nor was the\nrising popularity of Lope the cause, as is often said, notwithstanding\nhis own words to the contrary. When Lope began to write for the stage is\nuncertain, but it was certainly after Cervantes went to Seville.\n\nAmong the \"Nuevos Documentos\" printed by Senor Asensio y Toledo is one\ndated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is an agreement\nwith one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six comedies at\nfifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any case unless it\nappeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best that\nhad ever been represented in Spain. The test does not seem to have been\never applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to Rodrigo Osorio that\nthe comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented.\nAmong the correspondence of Cervantes there might have been found, no\ndoubt, more than one letter like that we see in the \"Rake's Progress,\"\n\"Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.\"\n\nHe was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 in\nhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won the\nfirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had been\nappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In order to\nremit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury, he\nentrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as the\nbankrupt's assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent to\nprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,\nwas a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he was\nreleased at the end of the year.\n\nIt was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king's taxes,\nthat he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that\nabound in the pages of \"Don Quixote:\" the Benedictine monks with\nspectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in\ncostume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on his\nhead, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches in his\nbundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered in the\nventa gateway listening to \"Felixmarte of Hircania\" read out to them; and\nthose little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how to bring in, the\nox-tail hanging up with the landlord's comb stuck in it, the wine-skins\nat the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry art, Helen going\noff in high spirits on Paris's arm, and Dido on the tower dropping tears\nas big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote\nregions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman,\nwith his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry, dreaming\naway his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his\ngreat-grandfather's old helmet was new. But it was in Seville that he\nfound out his true vocation, though he himself would not by any means\nhave admitted it to be so. It was there, in Triana, that he was first\ntempted to try his hand at drawing from life, and first brought his\nhumour into play in the exquisite little sketch of \"Rinconete y\nCortadillo,\" the germ, in more ways than one, of \"Don Quixote.\"\n\nWhere and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonment\nall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which it\nmay be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in Seville\nin November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaborate\ncatafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of\nPhilip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements. The\nwords in the preface to the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" are generally\nheld to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote\nthe beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so\nis extremely likely.\n\nThere is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a\nselect audience at the Duke of Bejar's, which may have helped to make the\nbook known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \"Don\nQuixote\" lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold\nenough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little\nfaith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it,\nthat he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for\nAragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The\nprinting was finished in December, and the book came out with the new\nyear, 1605. It is often said that \"Don Quixote\" was at first received\ncoldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner was it in the hands\nof the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at\nLisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a second edition with the\nadditional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, which he secured in\nFebruary.\n\nNo doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain\nsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among\nthe aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in general\nwere not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into\nridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas. The dramatists\nwho gathered round Lope as their leader regarded Cervantes as their\ncommon enemy, and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other\nclique, the culto poets who had Gongora for their chief. Navarrete, who\nknew nothing of the letter above mentioned, tries hard to show that the\nrelations between Cervantes and Lope were of a very friendly sort, as\nindeed they were until \"Don Quixote\" was written. Cervantes, indeed, to\nthe last generously and manfully declared his admiration of Lope's\npowers, his unfailing invention, and his marvellous fertility; but in the\npreface of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" and in the verses of \"Urganda\nthe Unknown,\" and one or two other places, there are, if we read between\nthe lines, sly hits at Lope's vanities and affectations that argue no\npersonal good-will; and Lope openly sneers at \"Don Quixote\" and\nCervantes, and fourteen years after his death gives him only a few lines\nof cold commonplace in the \"Laurel de Apolo,\" that seem all the colder\nfor the eulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere\nelse.\n\nIn 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning\nof 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the\nbalance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He\nremained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and\nscrivener's work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up\nstatements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like. So, at\nleast, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death\nof a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been carried into\nthe house in which he lived. In these he himself is described as a man\nwho wrote and transacted business, and it appears that his household then\nconsisted of his wife, the natural daughter Isabel de Saavedra already\nmentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow, her daughter Constanza, a\nmysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling herself his sister, for whom\nhis biographers cannot account, and a servant-maid.\n\nMeanwhile \"Don Quixote\" had been growing in favour, and its author's name\nwas now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed at\nBrussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet the\ndemand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The popularity of\nthe book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was led to bring out\nan edition in 1610; and another was called for in Brussels in 1611. It\nmight naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that\nhe had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set\nabout redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume.\n\nBut, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had\nstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had\ninserted in \"Don Quixote\" and instead of continuing the adventures of Don\nQuixote, he set to work to write more of these \"Novelas Exemplares\" as he\nafterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.\n\nThe novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the\nConde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty\nconfidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and\na half after the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had appeared, we get the\nfirst hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \"You shall see shortly,\" he\nsays, \"the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\"\nHis idea of \"shortly\" was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the\ndate to Sancho's letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed\nthat time twelvemonth.\n\nBut more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic\nambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that\nkept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to\nattempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, made him\npersevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win\nthe ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes was\nessentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the novels,\nwith the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled forehead,\nand bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine man. Nothing\nthat the managers might say could persuade him that the merits of his\nplays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair\nchance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on being the\nAeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama, based on the\ntrue principles of art, that was to be the envy of all nations; he was to\ndrive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the \"mirrors of nonsense\nand models of folly\" that were in vogue through the cupidity of the\nmanagers and shortsightedness of the authors; he was to correct and\neducate the public taste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of\nthe Greek drama--like the \"Numancia\" for instance--and comedies that\nwould not only amuse but improve and instruct. All this he was to do,\ncould he once get a hearing: there was the initial difficulty.\n\nHe shows plainly enough, too, that \"Don Quixote\" and the demolition of\nthe chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,\nindeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a\nfather to \"Don Quixote.\" Never was great work so neglected by its author.\nThat it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not\nalways his fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the\npress. He knew how the printers had blundered, but he never took the\ntrouble to correct them when the third edition was in progress, as a man\nwho really cared for the child of his brain would have done. He appears\nto have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de\nentretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says in the \"Viaje,\" \"to\ndivert the melancholy moody heart at any time or season.\" No doubt he had\nan affection for his hero, and was very proud of Sancho Panza. It would\nhave been strange indeed if he had not been proud of the most humorous\ncreation in all fiction. He was proud, too, of the popularity and success\nof the book, and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he\nshows his pride in a dozen passages in the Second Part. But it was not\nthe success he coveted. In all probability he would have given all the\nsuccess of \"Don Quixote,\" nay, would have seen every copy of \"Don\nQuixote\" burned in the Plaza Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega\nwas enjoying on an average once a week.\n\nAnd so he went on, dawdling over \"Don Quixote,\" adding a chapter now and\nagain, and putting it aside to turn to \"Persiles and Sigismunda\"--which,\nas we know, was to be the most entertaining book in the language, and the\nrival of \"Theagenes and Chariclea\"--or finishing off one of his darling\ncomedies; and if Robles asked when \"Don Quixote\" would be ready, the\nanswer no doubt was: En breve-shortly, there was time enough for that. At\nsixty-eight he was as full of life and hope and plans for the future as a\nboy of eighteen.\n\nNemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at\nhis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or\nNovember 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately\nprinted at Tarragona, and calling itself \"Second Volume of the Ingenious\nGentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso Fernandez de\nAvellaneda of Tordesillas.\" The last half of Chapter LIX and most of the\nfollowing chapters of the Second Part give us some idea of the effect\nproduced upon him, and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by\nthe reflection that he had no one to blame but himself. Had Avellaneda,\nin fact, been content with merely bringing out a continuation to \"Don\nQuixote,\" Cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance. His own\nintentions were expressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the\nbook; nay, in his last words, \"forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,\"\nhe seems actually to invite some one else to continue the work, and he\nmade no sign until eight years and a half had gone by; by which time\nAvellaneda's volume was no doubt written.\n\nIn fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere\ncontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to\nit, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man\ncould pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his\nhand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless,\naccuses him of envy of Lope's success, of petulance and querulousness,\nand so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda's reason for\nthis personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is\nclear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope's school, for he has the\nimpudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his\ncriticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics\nand baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear\non it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes\nknew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an\ninvisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a\nmosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language\npronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself,\nsupports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an\necclesiastic, a Dominican probably.\n\nAny merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull\nto reflect much. \"Dull and dirty\" will always be, I imagine, the verdict\nof the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor\nplagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by\nCervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for\ncastles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and\nSancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all\nthrough he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has\ncontrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth\ncentury novellieri and without their sprightliness.\n\nBut whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the debt\nwe owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, \"Don Quixote\" would\nhave come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if\nCervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he would\nhave left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further\nadventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It is\nplain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral\nromances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but for\nAvellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is more likely\nthat, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume would\nhave remained unfinished till his death, and that we should have never\nmade the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with Sancho to\nBarataria.\n\nFrom the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been\nhaunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,\nand putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off his task\nand protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him. The\nconclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work\nand the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda\nbecomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion\nand for that we must thank Avellaneda.\n\nThe new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed\ntill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put together\nthe comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years,\nand, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, and\npublished them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, in\nwhich he gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his own\nattempts as a dramatist. It is needless to say they were put forward by\nCervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits. The\nreader, however, was not to suppose they were his last word or final\neffort in the drama, for he had in hand a comedy called \"Engano a los\nojos,\" about which, if he mistook not, there would be no question.\n\nOf this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his\nhealth had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of dropsy,\non the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare,\nnominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed.\nHe died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully.\n\nWas it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell us\nthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life of\npoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, but\nCervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils. His was\nnot one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue\nof their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he\nwas proof against it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way\nto despondency or prostrated by dejection. As for poverty, it was with\nhim a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he ever allows to\nescape him is when he says, \"Happy he to whom Heaven has given a piece of\nbread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.\"\nAdd to all this his vital energy and mental activity, his restless\ninvention and his sanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough\nto doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life. He who could\ntake Cervantes' distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them\nwould not make so bad a bargain, perhaps, as far as happiness in life is\nconcerned.\n\nOf his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, in\naccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian\nnuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an\ninmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another\nconvent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains of\nCervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and the clue\nto their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishes\nperhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect\nbrought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is a good\ndeal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers one would\nsuppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man but against\nhis memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits, and left\nhim to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hard life and\nunworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he done to\ndistinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning a\nprecarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had been\nwounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country's cause,\nbut there were hundreds of others in the same case. He had written a\nmediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and some plays which\nmanifestly did not comply with the primary condition of pleasing: were\nthe playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse them, because the\nauthor was to produce \"Don Quixote\" twenty years afterwards?\n\nThe scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on\nthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to\nits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man writes\na book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldly\nreceived by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of\nwigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the\nsentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all against\nhim, it was because \"Don Quixote\" was what it was; and if the general\npublic did not come forward to make him comfortable for the rest of his\ndays, it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the\nEnglish-speaking public that did not pay off Scott's liabilities. It did\nthe best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it, and\nencouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others.\n\nIt has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no\nmonument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of\nhim; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las\nCortes, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set\nup to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not\nworthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of \"such\nweak witness of his name;\" or what could a monument do in his case except\ntestify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up? Si\nmonumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller's shop will show\nwhat bathos there would be in a monument to the author of \"Don Quixote.\"\n\nNine editions of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had already appeared\nbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his\nown estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his\ndeath. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time, but\nby 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the\npresent day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and\nregularly. The translations show still more clearly in what request the\nbook has been from the very outset. In seven years from the completion of\nthe work it had been translated into the four leading languages of\nEurope. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been so widely diffused as\n\"Don Quixote.\" The \"Imitatio Christi\" may have been translated into as\nmany different languages, and perhaps \"Robinson Crusoe\" and the \"Vicar of\nWakefield\" into nearly as many, but in multiplicity of translations and\neditions \"Don Quixote\" leaves them all far behind.\n\nStill more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. \"Don\nQuixote\" has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about\nknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who had\nnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel\nthe humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author's purpose.\nAnother curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the\nworld, is one of the most intensely national. \"Manon Lescaut\" is not more\nthoroughly French, \"Tom Jones\" not more English, \"Rob Roy\" not more\nScotch, than \"Don Quixote\" is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in\nsentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret of\nthis unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh three\ncenturies? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in the\nworld, \"Don Quixote\" is the most catholic. There is something in it for\nevery sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. As\nCervantes himself says with a touch of pride, \"It is thumbed and read and\ngot by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves, the\nyoung people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise\nit.\"\n\nBut it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than its\nhumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of\nhuman nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude, is\nthe vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon the sheep,\nthe battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino's helmet, the balsam of\nFierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill, Sancho\ntossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master and man,\nthat were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are so still to\nsome extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that \"Don Quixote\"\nwas generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain for a long time, as\nlittle more than a queer droll book, full of laughable incidents and\nabsurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to much consideration\nor care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to 1771, when the\nfamous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere trade editions, badly and\ncarelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap-books\nintended only for popular use, with, in most instances, uncouth\nillustrations and clap-trap additions by the publisher.\n\nTo England belongs the credit of having been the first country to\nrecognise the right of \"Don Quixote\" to better treatment than this. The\nLondon edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret's from having been\nsuggested by him, was not a mere edition de luxe. It produced \"Don\nQuixote\" in becoming form as regards paper and type, and embellished with\nplates which, if not particularly happy as illustrations, were at least\nwell intentioned and well executed, but it also aimed at correctness of\ntext, a matter to which nobody except the editors of the Valencia and\nBrussels editions had given even a passing thought; and for a first\nattempt it was fairly successful, for though some of its emendations are\ninadmissible, a good many of them have been adopted by all subsequent\neditors.\n\nThe zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a\nremarkable change of sentiment with regard to \"Don Quixote.\" A vast\nnumber of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It\nbecame almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour was not\nentirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as an\naltogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the\nstalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot his\nphilosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for on\nthis point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the object he\naimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in the\npreface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, that he\nhad no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this, to\nadvanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have been\nsomething else.\n\nOne theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth the\neternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit of\npoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy never\nevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its inner\nconsciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be found in\n\"Don Quixote,\" because it is to be found everywhere in life, and\nCervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community in which\nthe never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and Don\nQuixote would not be recognized as true to nature. In the stone age,\namong the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don Quixotes and\nSancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see\nthe facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who could see nothing else.\nBut to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such\nidea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very\nunlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes\nhimself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort\nmade by anyone else.\n\nThe extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is\nquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the\nprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth\ncentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader\nbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the\nlargest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is\nabundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to\ngrow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady\nstream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to\ntheir words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of\ntheir readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust.\n\nThat this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample\nprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who\nlook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry\nitself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,\nthanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no\ngreater one than saying that \"Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away.\" In\nthe first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain's\nchivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done when\nGranada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,\nit could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free\ninstitutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was not chivalry\nbut a degrading mockery of it.\n\nThe true nature of the \"right arm\" and the \"bright array,\" before which,\naccording to the poet, \"the world gave ground,\" and which Cervantes'\nsingle laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his own\ncountrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in\nhis \"Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.\" \"Before the appearance in the\nworld of that labour of Cervantes,\" he said, \"it was next to an\nimpossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without\ndanger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before\nthe windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined the\nwhole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight-errants. But\nafter the world became a little acquainted with that notable history, the\nman that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don\nQuixote, and found himself the jest of high and low. And I verily believe\nthat to this, and this only, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit\nwhich has run through all our councils for a century past, so little\nagreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors.\"\n\nTo call \"Don Quixote\" a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,\nargues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moral\nwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and\ndiscomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as\nit can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born\nof vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to\nan end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances and\nconsequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerable\nnuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot distinguish\nbetween the one kind and the other, no doubt \"Don Quixote\" is a sad book;\nno doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so\nbeautiful a sentiment as that \"it is a hard case to make slaves of those\nwhom God and Nature made free,\" should be ungratefully pelted by the\nscoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others\nof a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless\nself-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for\nall the mischief it does in the world.\n\nA very slight examination of the structure of \"Don Quixote\" will suffice\nto show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind\nwhen he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which \"with a few\nstrokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,\" he had\nno idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him. There can\nbe little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with\nthose he had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results\nthat might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act\nthe part of a knight-errant in modern life.\n\nIt is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the\noriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would not\nhave omitted him in his hero's outfit, which he obviously meant to be\ncomplete. Him we owe to the landlord's chance remark in Chapter III that\nknights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don\nQuixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair\nof scissors.\n\nThe story was written at first, like the others, without any division and\nwithout the intervention of Cide Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not\nunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or\nAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking\nof the Don's library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that\nfirst suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What,\nif instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make\nhis tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style,\nincidents, and spirit?\n\nIn pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily\ndivided what he had written into chapters on the model of \"Amadis,\"\ninvented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cide\nHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the\nchivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some\nrecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value\nof Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho's part, but to\nthe whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he\nannounces his intention of taking his ass with him. \"About the ass,\" we\nare told, \"Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call\nto mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back;\nbut no instance occurred to his memory.\" We can see the whole scene at a\nglance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his\nmaster, upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself.\nThis is Sancho's mission throughout the book; he is an unconscious\nMephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his master's\naspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some\nunintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world of fact\nand commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.\n\nBy the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, and\nsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,\nthe case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not\nmerely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since\nceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was no\noccasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his readers\ntold him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don Quixote and\nmore Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions. To himself,\ntoo, his creations had become realities, and he had become proud of them,\nespecially of Sancho. He began the Second Part, therefore, under very\ndifferent conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once.\nEven in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more\nflowing, more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of\nhis audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also. In the First\nPart, Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He is\nnothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the\nchivalry romances. In all that he says and does he is simply repeating\nthe lesson he has learned from his books; and therefore, it is absurd to\nspeak of him in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they\ndilate upon his nobleness, disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so\nforth. It was the business of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress\ninjuries, and succour the distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he\nmakes his business when he takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound\nto be intrepid, and so he feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron's\nmelodious nonsense about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is\nthat \"'t is his virtue makes him mad!\" The exact opposite is the truth;\nit is his madness makes him virtuous.\n\nIn the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it was\na point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that his\nhero's madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of\nchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,\nwhose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this\nis that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his\nown reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the\nrelief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace\nbook.\n\nIt is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not\nvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such\nas his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection\nfor Sancho together with his impatience of the squire's loquacity and\nimpertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little more\nthan a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a\ngreat deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.\n\nAs to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to\nthe First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he\nhad been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him\nin hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by\nmaking him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was\ntoo true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he\nreappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a\ndifference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same\ntime with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline\nhas been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few\ntouches of a master's hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a\ncharacter portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important and\nprominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his\nmatchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the\naction of the story.\n\nHis development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the\nFirst Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of\nthe highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in;\nlike Falstaff's, they resemble the father that begets them; they are\nsimple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the\nservice of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see\nwhen he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her\nladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in\nthis instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers\nin his account of the journey on Clavileno.\n\nIn the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the\nchivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of\nthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of\nMontesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and\nanother distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote's blind\nadoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere\nanimalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to\nmake merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes' humour the latter\nwas naturally an attractive subject for ridicule. Like everything else in\nthese romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of\nchivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence\nof those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets. When a troubadour\nprofessed his readiness to obey his lady in all things, he made it\nincumbent upon the next comer, if he wished to avoid the imputation of\ntameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her will, which\nthe next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so\nexpressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings\nat an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of\nlove came into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern\nEurope, and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of\nBeatrice and Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found\nexponents in writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes\ndeals with in Don Quixote's passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has\nhe carried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the\nbackground, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very existence\nwe are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote's worship of her virtues and\ncharms with an additional extravagance, and gives still more point to the\ncaricature of the sentiment and language of the romances.\n\nOne of the great merits of \"Don Quixote,\" and one of the qualities that\nhave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the\nmost cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,\npoints obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which do\nnot immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often takes it\nfor granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only\nintelligible to a few. For example, on many of his readers in Spain, and\nmost of his readers out of it, the significance of his choice of a\ncountry for his hero is completely lost. It would be going too far to say\nthat no one can thoroughly comprehend \"Don Quixote\" without having seen\nLa Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpse of La Mancha will give an\ninsight into the meaning of Cervantes such as no commentator can give. Of\nall the regions of Spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of\nromance. Of all the dull central plateau of the Peninsula it is the\ndullest tract. There is something impressive about the grim solitudes of\nEstremadura; and if the plains of Leon and Old Castile are bald and\ndreary, they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in\nrelics of the past. But there is no redeeming feature in the Manchegan\nlandscape; it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity; the\nfew towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace,\nthere is nothing venerable about them, they have not even the\npicturesqueness of poverty; indeed, Don Quixote's own village,\nArgamasilla, has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim\nregularity of its streets and houses; everything is ignoble; the very\nwindmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind.\n\nTo anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of \"Don\nQuixote of La Mancha\" gave the key to the author's meaning at once. La\nMancha as the knight's country and scene of his chivalries is of a piece\nwith the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire,\nknighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims of\noppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote's world\nand the world he lived in, between things as he saw them and things as\nthey were.\n\nIt is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole\nhumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by the\nmajority of those who have undertaken to interpret \"Don Quixote.\" It has\nbeen completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure,\nthe great majority of the artists who illustrated \"Don Quixote\" knew\nnothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no idea but the\nabstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do full\njustice to the humour of Don Quixote's misconception in taking it for a\ncastle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal.\nBut even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the\nfull force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Dore's drawing\nof Don Quixote watching his armour in the inn-yard. Whether or not the\nVenta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inn\ndescribed in \"Don Quixote,\" beyond all question it was just such an\ninn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his mind's eye, and\nit was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive\ndraw-well in the corner that he meant Don Quixote to deposit his armour.\nGustave Dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever\nwatered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby\nentirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic,\ncommonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that\ngives a significance to Don Quixote's vigil and the ceremony that\nfollows.\n\nCervantes' humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort,\nthe strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is\nthe incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the\nideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and\ntruth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous\ncreation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which\nCervantes was the first great master, \"Cervantes' serious air,\" which\nsits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential\nto this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the\nhands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery\nof Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent\nCervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of\nMotteux's version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French\ntranslators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the\nnarrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is\nsaying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give\nits peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the\nexact opposite of the humour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists.\nEven when Uncle Toby is at his best, you are always aware of \"the man\nSterne\" behind him, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he\nis producing. Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and\nSancho. He and Swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out\nof sight, or, more properly speaking, never think about themselves at\nall, unlike our latter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived\nthe old horse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque\nassumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.\n\nIt is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other\nlanguage is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and a\nsonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make\nan absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most\npreposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza's drollery the\ndespair of the conscientious translator. Sancho's curt comments can never\nfall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred from their\nnative Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners have failed to\ndo justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his own\ncountrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant's relish of \"Don\nQuixote,\" one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not\nlooked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.\n\nThe craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated\nitself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book\nand run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own\nimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that\nscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are\ninfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and\npompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that\nwhile they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of\nimaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of\nthe quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate\nhighest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry.\n\nTo speak of \"Don Quixote\" as if it were merely a humorous book would be a\nmanifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of\ncommonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the\nobservations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring\nlife. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.\nAmong modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies\nof character, but there is no book richer in individualised character.\nWhat Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he\nnever, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure.\nThere is life and individuality in all his characters, however little\nthey may have to do, or however short a time they may be before the\nreader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the\ntwo students met on the road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move\nand have their being; and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of\nCervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all. Even poor\nMaritornes, with her deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and\n\"some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her;\" and as for\nSancho, though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him,\nunless it be a sort of dog-like affection for his master, who is there\nthat in his heart does not love him?\n\nBut it is, after all, the humour of \"Don Quixote\" that distinguishes it\nfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as\none of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, \"the best\nnovel in the world beyond all comparison.\" It is its varied humour,\nranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare's or\nMoliere's that has naturalised it in every country where there are\nreaders, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.\n\n\n\nSOME COMMENDATORY VERSES\n\n\nURGANDA THE UNKNOWN\n\nTo the book of Don Quixote of la Mancha\n\n If to be welcomed by the good,\n   O Book! thou make thy steady aim,\n No empty chatterer will dare\n   To question or dispute thy claim.\n But if perchance thou hast a mind\n   To win of idiots approbation,\n Lost labour will be thy reward,\n   Though they'll pretend appreciation.\n\n They say a goodly shade he finds\n   Who shelters 'neath a goodly tree;\n And such a one thy kindly star\n   In Bejar bath provided thee:\n A royal tree whose spreading boughs\n   A show of princely fruit display;\n A tree that bears a noble Duke,\n   The Alexander of his day.\n\n Of a Manchegan gentleman\n   Thy purpose is to tell the story,\n Relating how he lost his wits\n   O'er idle tales of love and glory,\n Of \"ladies, arms, and cavaliers:\"\n   A new Orlando Furioso-\n Innamorato, rather--who\n   Won Dulcinea del Toboso.\n\n Put no vain emblems on thy shield;\n   All figures--that is bragging play.\n A modest dedication make,\n   And give no scoffer room to say,\n \"What!

But I could not counteract Nature's law\nthat everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile,\nilltilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical\noffspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any\nother imagination--just what might be begotten in a prison, where every\nmisery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?\nTranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies,\nmurmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make\neven the most barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that\nfill it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly,\nloutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does\nnot see his defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind\nand body, and talks of them to his friends as wit and grace. I,\nhowever--for though I pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to\n\"Don Quixote\"--have no desire to go with the current of custom, or to\nimplore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do,\nto pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine.\nThou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and\nthy will as free as any man's, whate'er he be, thou art in thine own\nhouse and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and thou knowest\nthe common saying, \"Under my cloak I kill the king;\" all which exempts\nand frees thee from every consideration and obligation, and thou canst\nsay what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill\nor rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it.\n\nMy wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,\nwithout any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary\nsonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the\nbeginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some\nlabour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now\nreading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay\nit down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times, as I was\npondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the\ndesk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came\nin unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me\nso deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of\nit, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the\nstory of \"Don Quixote,\" which so troubled me that I had a mind not to\nmake any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.\n\n\"For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient\nlawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering\nso many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my\nyears upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of\ninvention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning\nand wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end,\nafter the fashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and\nprofanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole\nherd of philosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and\nconvince them that the authors are men of learning, erudition, and\neloquence. And then, when they quote the Holy Scriptures!--anyone would\nsay they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as\nthey do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a\ndistracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it\nis a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this there will be\nnothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note\nat the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to\nplace them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C,\nbeginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis,\nthough one was a slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do\nwithout sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are\ndukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I\nwere to ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me\nthem, and such as the productions of those that have the highest\nreputation in our Spain could not equal.\n\n\"In short, my friend,\" I continued, \"I am determined that Senor Don\nQuixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until\nHeaven provide some one to garnish him with all those things he stands in\nneed of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of\nlearning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and\ncareless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without\nthem. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason\nenough, what you have heard from me.\"\n\nHearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and\nbreaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \"Before God, Brother, now am I\ndisabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I\nhave known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and\nsensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the\nheaven is from the earth. It is possible that things of so little moment\nand so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours,\nfit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this\ncomes, not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too\nlittle knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth?\nWell, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and\nshutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all\nthose deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing\nbefore the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and\nmirror of all knight-errantry.\"\n\n\"Say on,\" said I, listening to his talk; \"how do you propose to make up\nfor my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?\"\n\nTo which he made answer, \"Your first difficulty about the sonnets,\nepigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and\nwhich ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if\nyou yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards\nbaptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on\nPrester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my\nknowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were\nnot, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the\nfact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie\nagainst you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.\n\n\"As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom you\ntake the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is only\ncontriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you may\nhappen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you much\ntrouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, to\ninsert\n\n_Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;_\n\nand then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if you\nallude to the power of death, to come in with--\n\n_Pallida mors Aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,\nRegumque turres._\n\n\"If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go at\nonce to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount of\nresearch, and quote no less than the words of God himself: Ego autem dico\nvobis: diligite inimicos vestros. If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to\nthe Gospel: De corde exeunt cogitationes malae. If of the fickleness of\nfriends, there is Cato, who will give you his distich:\n\n_Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,\nTempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris._\n\n\"With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for a\ngrammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour and\nprofit.\n\n\"With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may safely\ndo it in this way. If you mention any giant in your book contrive that it\nshall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which will cost you\nalmost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can put--The giant Golias\nor Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David slew by a mighty\nstone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the Book of\nKings--in the chapter where you find it written.\n\n\"Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and\ncosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,\nand there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting\nforth--The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its\nsource in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the\nwalls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has\ngolden sands, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will\ngive you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women,\nthere is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia,\nLaida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit; if\nwith hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches\nor enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant\ncaptains, Julius Caesar himself will lend you himself in his own\n'Commentaries,' and Plutarch will give you a thousand Alexanders. If you\nshould deal with love, with two ounces you may know of Tuscan you can go\nto Leon the Hebrew, who will supply you to your heart's content; or if\nyou should not care to go to foreign countries you have at home Fonseca's\n'Of the Love of God,' in which is condensed all that you or the most\nimaginative mind can want on the subject. In short, all you have to do is\nto manage to quote these names, or refer to these stories I have\nmentioned, and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations,\nand I swear by all that's good to fill your margins and use up four\nsheets at the end of the book.\n\n\"Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,\nand you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have only\nto look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say\nyourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and though\nthe imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need to\nborrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be some simple\nenough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain,\nartless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this\nlong catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of\nauthority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify\nwhether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way\nconcerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has\nno need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from\nbeginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which\nAristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any\nknowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology\ncome within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical\nmeasurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to\ndo with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human\nand divine, a sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should\ndress itself. It has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its\ncomposition, and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will\nbe. And as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the\nauthority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world and\nwith the public, there is no need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms\nfrom philosophers, precepts from Holy Scripture, fables from poets,\nspeeches from orators, or miracles from saints; but merely to take care\nthat your style and diction run musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with\nclear, proper, and well-placed words, setting forth your purpose to the\nbest of your power, and putting your ideas intelligibly, without\nconfusion or obscurity. Strive, too, that in reading your story the\nmelancholy may be moved to laughter, and the merry made merrier still;\nthat the simple shall not be wearied, that the judicious shall admire the\ninvention, that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to\npraise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that\nill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised\nby many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small\nsuccess.\"\n\nIn profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his\nobservations made such an impression on me that, without attempting to\nquestion them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined\nto make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my\nfriend's good sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a\ntime of need, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition or\nalteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held\nby all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have\nbeen the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many years\nbeen seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service\nI render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured a\nknight, but I do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt make\nwith the famous Sancho Panza, his squire, in whom, to my thinking, I have\ngiven thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scattered\nthrough the swarm of the vain books of chivalry. And so--may God give\nthee health, and not forget me.

An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra\non Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it\nwent in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match\nfor holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best\nhomespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under\ntwenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the\nhack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours\nwas bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a\nvery early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was\nQuixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among\nthe authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable\nconjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is\nof but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a\nhair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it.\n\nYou must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at\nleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading\nbooks of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely\nneglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his\nproperty; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that\nhe sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and\nbrought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none\nhe liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva's composition,\nfor their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in\nhis sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and\ncartels, where he often found passages like \"the reason of the unreason\nwith which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I\nmurmur at your beauty;\" or again, \"the high heavens, that of your\ndivinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the\ndesert your greatness deserves.\" Over conceits of this sort the poor\ngentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand\nthem and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not\nhave made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special\npurpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave\nand took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who\nhad cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with\nseams and scars. He commended, however, the author's way of ending his\nbook with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was\nhe tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there\nproposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece\nof work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented\nhim.\n\nMany an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned\nman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,\nPalmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village\nbarber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight\nof Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was\nDon Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that\nwas equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose\nlike his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind\nhim. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his\nnights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring\nover them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so\ndry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read\nabout in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds,\nwooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so\npossessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read\nof was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it.\nHe used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was\nnot to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one\nback-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more\nof Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of\nenchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he\nstrangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the\ngiant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always\narrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But\nabove all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him\nsallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when\nbeyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history\nsays, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of\na Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the\nbargain.\n\nIn short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion\nthat ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it\nwas right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for\nthe service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of\nhimself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest\nof adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as\nbeing the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of\nwrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue,\nhe was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself\ncrowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so,\nled away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he\nset himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.\n\nThe first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to\nhis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner\neaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as\nbest he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no\nclosed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his\ningenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard\nwhich, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that,\nin order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his\nsword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an\ninstant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had\nknocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that\ndanger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he\nwas satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more\nexperiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most\nperfect construction.\n\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a\nreal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \"tantum pellis et\nossa fuit,\" surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the\nBabieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give\nhim, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse\nbelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,\nshould be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as\nto indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and\nwhat he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a\nnew character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a\ndistinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling\nhe was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out,\nrejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his\nmemory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his\nthinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack\nbefore he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks\nin the world.\n\nHaving got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to\nget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this\npoint, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \"Don Quixote,\"\nwhence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history\nhave inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and\nnot Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the\nvaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing\nmore, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous,\nand called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to\nadd on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha,\nwhereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country,\nand did honour to it in taking his surname from it.\n\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his\nhack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that\nnothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love\nwith; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or\nfruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, \"If, for my sins,\nor by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common\noccurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or\ncleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him,\nwill it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that\nhe may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a\nhumble, submissive voice say, 'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the\nisland of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never\nsufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded\nme to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me\nat your pleasure'?\" Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of\nthis speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady!\nThere was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very\ngood-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though,\nso far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.\nHer name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the\ntitle of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which\nshould not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and\nindicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her\nDulcinea del Toboso--she being of El Toboso--a name, to his mind,\nmusical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already\nbestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME\n\n\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the\nexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world\nwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,\ngrievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties\nto discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and\nwithout anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day\n(which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of\narmour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his\nbuckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth\nupon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with\nwhat ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely\ndid he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck\nhim, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very\noutset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that\naccording to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms\nagainst any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a\nnovice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield\nuntil by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waver\nin his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made\nup his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came\nacross, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read\nin the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he\nresolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than\nan ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that\nwhich his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of\nadventures.\n\nThus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to\nhimself and saying, \"Who knows but that in time to come, when the\nveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes\nit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do\nit after this fashion? 'Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o'er the\nface of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,\nscarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to\nhail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn,\nthat, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to\nmortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the\nrenowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted\nhis celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and\nfamous Campo de Montiel;'\" which in fact he was actually traversing.\n\"Happy the age, happy the time,\" he continued, \"in which shall be made\nknown my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble,\nlimned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician,\nwhoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this\nwondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the\nconstant companion of my ways and wanderings.\" Presently he broke out\nagain, as if he were love-stricken in earnest, \"O Princess Dulcinea, lady\nof this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me\nforth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the\npresence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart,\nthy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.\"\n\nSo he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the\nstyle of those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well\nas he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so\nrapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he\nhad any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable\nhappening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to\nencounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm.\n\nWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of\nPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have\nascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of\nLa Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his\nhack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all\naround to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty where\nhe might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far\nout of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the\nportals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace\nhe reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two\nyoung women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to\nSeville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn;\nand as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imaged\nseemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,\nthe moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its\nfour turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the\ndrawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of\nthe sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at\na short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf\nwould show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give\nnotice that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they\nwere slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the\nstable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who\nwere standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or\nlovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.\n\nAt this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the\nstubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is\nwhat they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together,\nand forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the\nsignal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious\nsatisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man\nof this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were\nturning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by\ntheir flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty\nvisage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, \"Your\nladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to\nthe order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to\nhighborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.\" The girls were\nlooking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which\nthe clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens,\na thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their\nlaughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \"Modesty becomes\nthe fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness;\nthis, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none\nother than to serve you.\"\n\nThe incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier\nonly increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his irritation,\nand matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had\nnot come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,\nseeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more\nthan his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all\nindisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but,\nin truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it\nbest to speak him fairly, so he said, \"Senor Caballero, if your worship\nwants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is\nplenty of everything else here.\" Don Quixote, observing the respectful\nbearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed\nin his eyes), made answer, \"Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice,\nfor\n\n'My armour is my only wear,\nMy only rest the fray.'\"\n\nThe host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a\n\"worthy of Castile,\" though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from\nthe strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks\nas a student or a page. \"In that case,\" said he,\n\n\"'Your bed is on the flinty rock,\nYour sleep to watch alway;'\n\nand if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of\nsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single\nnight.\" So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who\ngot down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his\nfast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,\nas he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The\nlandlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said,\nnor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to\nsee what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this\ntime made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They\nhad taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor\nsaw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had\nfastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots,\nrequired to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to,\nso he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and\noddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his\narmour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree\nbelonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:\n\n\"Oh, never, surely, was there knight\n  So served by hand of dame,\nAs served was he, Don Quixote hight,\n  When from his town he came;\nWith maidens waiting on himself,\n  Princesses on his hack--\n\nor Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, and Don Quixote\nof La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring myself\nuntil my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the\nnecessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion\nhas given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. A time,\nhowever, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then\nthe might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.\"\n\nThe girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had\nnothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to\neat. \"I would gladly eat a bit of something,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I\nfeel it would come very seasonably.\" The day happened to be a Friday, and\nin the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call\nin Castile \"abadejo,\" in Andalusia \"bacallao,\" and in some places\n\"curadillo,\" and in others \"troutlet;\" so they asked him if he thought he\ncould eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \"If there be\ntroutlets enough,\" said Don Quixote, \"they will be the same thing as a\ntrout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in small\nchange or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are\nlike veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat.\nBut whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of\narms cannot be borne without support to the inside.\" They laid a table\nfor him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host\nbrought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a\npiece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable\nsight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver\nup, he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless\nsome one else placed it there, and this service one of the ladies\nrendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would\nhave been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in\nhis mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore\nwith patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.\n\nWhile this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he\napproached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby\ncompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and\nthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,\nthe bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan\nof the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had\nbeen to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not\nbeen dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully\nengage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED\nA KNIGHT\n\n\nHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse\nsupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself\ninto the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \"From\nthis spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the\nboon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the\nhuman race.\" The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a\nspeech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing\nwhat to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose\nuntil he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \"I looked for no\nless, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I\nhave to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has\ngranted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that\nto-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus\ntomorrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire,\nenabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world\nseeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of\nchivalry and of knights-errant like myself, whose ambition is directed to\nsuch deeds.\"\n\nThe landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had\nalready some suspicion of his guest's want of wits, was quite convinced\nof it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the\nnight he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was\nquite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive\nwas natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and\nhis gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger\ndays had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of\nadventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds\nof Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little\nMarket of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the\nStrand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and\ndivers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and\nthe lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows,\nruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under\nthe notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until\nat last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon\nhis property and upon that of others; and where he received all\nknights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the\ngreat love he bore them and that they might share their substance with\nhim in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this\ncastle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as\nit had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of\nnecessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it\nthat night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing,\nthe requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a\nknight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked\nif he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had\nnot a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read\nof any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was\nmistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the\nauthor's opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and\nnecessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore\nthat they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and\nestablished that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full\nand unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of\nemergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to\ncure the wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they\nengaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was\nsome one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage\nmagician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud\nsome damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting\none drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant\nand left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever. But in\ncase this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that\ntheir squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint\nand ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had\nno squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried\neverything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's\ncroup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless\nfor some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably\nregarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his\ngodson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time\nforth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would\nfind the advantage of them when he least expected it.\n\nDon Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was\narranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one\nside of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on\na trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his\narm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and\ndown in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to\nfall.\n\nThe landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of\nhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he\ncontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they\nflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he\nsometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on\nhis armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the\nnight closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie\nwith his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen\nby all.\n\nMeanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water\nhis team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote's armour as it lay\non the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud\nvoice, \"O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on\nthe armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a\ncare what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life\nas the penalty of thy rashness.\" The carrier gave no heed to these words\n(and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his\nhealth), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from\nhim. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his\nthoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \"Aid me, lady\nmine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast\nwhich thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail\nme in this first jeopardy;\" and, with these words and others to the same\npurpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and\nwith it smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he stretched him on\nthe ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there\nwould have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up\nhis armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.\n\n\n\n\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the\ncarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water\nto his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear\nthe trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid\nfrom anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his\nlance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head into\npieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the\nnoise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the\nlandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and\nwith his hand on his sword exclaimed, \"O Lady of Beauty, strength and\nsupport of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy\ngreatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an\nadventure.\" By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have\nflinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades\nof the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance\nto shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could\nwith his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour\nunprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had\nalready told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be\naccountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote,\ncalling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed\nknights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born\nknight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he would call to\naccount for his treachery. \"But of you,\" he cried, \"base and vile rabble,\nI make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye\nshall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be.\" This he\nuttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants\nwith a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of\nthe landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off\nthe wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed\nthe watch over his armour.\n\nBut these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the\nlandlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at\nonce the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure\ncould occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,\nwithout his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who,\nhowever, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already\ntold him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed\nfor what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the\norder, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and\nin the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle\nof a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching\nthe armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours\nonly, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it\nall, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of\nit with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and\nfelt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul\nalive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his\nbidding.\n\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\nwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\ncarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\nkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\nsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and\ngave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart\nslap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he\nwas saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies\nto gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and\ngravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at\neach stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice\nknight's prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with\nthe sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May God make your worship a very\nfortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.\" Don Quixote asked her\nname in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was\nbeholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her\nsome portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She\nanswered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she\nwas the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of\nSanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem\nhim as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour\nif thenceforward she assumed the \"Don\" and called herself Dona Tolosa.\nShe promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with\nher followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword.\nHe asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the\ndaughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don\nQuixote requested that she would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Dona\nMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\n\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\nnever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\nhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling\nRocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned\nthanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so\nextraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.\nThe landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric\nthough with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the\nreckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN\n\n\nDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so\nexhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was like\nto burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as\nto the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring\nto money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with\nall, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a\nfarm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very\nwell qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he\nturned his horse's head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded\nof his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to\ntread the earth.\n\nHe had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to\ncome feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard\nthem he exclaimed, \"Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,\nthat it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I\nhave undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no\ndoubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid\nand protection;\" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction\nwhence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the\nwood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and\nstripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,\nfrom whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer\nwas flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings\nand commands, repeating, \"Your mouth shut and your eyes open!\" while the\nyouth made answer, \"I won't do it again, master mine; by God's passion I\nwon't do it again, and I'll take more care of the flock another time.\"\n\nSeeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,\n\"Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend\nhimself; mount your steed and take your lance\" (for there was a lance\nleaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \"and I will make you\nknow that you are behaving as a coward.\" The farmer, seeing before him\nthis figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave\nhimself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \"Sir Knight, this youth that\nI am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep\nthat I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and\nwhen I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of\nniggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God,\nand on my soul, he lies.\"\n\n\"Lies before me, base clown!\" said Don Quixote. \"By the sun that shines\non us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once\nwithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end\nof you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom\nDon Quixote asked how much his master owed him.\n\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up,\nfound that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay it\ndown immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\n\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn\n(though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to be\ntaken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him,\nand a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n\n\"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes and the\nblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him\nwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid\nfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from\nhim when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that\nscore he owes you nothing.\"\n\n\"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres\ncome home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\"\n\n\"I go with him!\" said the youth. \"Nay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the\nworld; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.\"\n\n\"He will do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"I have only to\ncommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of\nknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the\npayment.\"\n\n\"Consider what you are saying, senor,\" said the youth; \"this master of\nmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for he\nis Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\"\n\n\"That matters little,\" replied Don Quixote; \"there may be Haldudos\nknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but this master of mine--of what works is\nhe the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\"\n\n\"I do not refuse, brother Andres,\" said the farmer, \"be good enough to\ncome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there are\nin the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.\"\n\n\"For the perfumery I excuse you,\" said Don Quixote; \"give it to him in\nreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;\nif not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish\nyou; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And\nif you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be\nmore firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you,\nand keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties\nthat have been already declared to you.\"\n\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The\nfarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared\nthe wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and\nsaid, \"Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that\nundoer of wrongs has commanded me.\"\n\n\"My oath on it,\" said Andres, \"your worship will be well advised to obey\nthe command of that good knight--may he live a thousand years--for, as he\nis a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come\nback and do as he said.\"\n\n\"My oath on it, too,\" said the farmer; \"but as I have a strong affection\nfor you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;\" and\nseizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a\nflogging that he left him for dead.\n\n\"Now, Master Andres,\" said the farmer, \"call on the undoer of wrongs; you\nwill find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done\nwith you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\" But at last he\nuntied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put\nthe sentence pronounced into execution.\n\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look\nfor the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had\nhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all\nthat, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\n\nThus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly\nsatisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very\nhappy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards\nhis village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \"Well mayest\nthou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del\nToboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold\nsubject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renowned\nas is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows,\nyesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the\ngreatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty\nperpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder\nruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.\"\n\nHe now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he\nwas reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to\nconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for\na while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his\nhead, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his\nfirst intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he\nhad gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people,\nwho, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to\nbuy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their\nsunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.\nScarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that\nthis must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he\ncould those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one\nmade on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing\nand determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance\nready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the\nmiddle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,\nfor such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come\nnear enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All\nthe world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there\nis no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea\ndel Toboso.\"\n\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the\nstrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at once\nguessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly\nwhat was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and one\nof them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said to\nhim, \"Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of;\nshow her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all\nour hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on\nyour part required of us.\"\n\n\"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would\nyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that\nwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend\nit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant\nrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood\nrequires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,\nhere do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I\nmaintain.\"\n\n\"Sir Knight,\" replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name of\nthis present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our\nconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\nof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens\nof the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us\nsome portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat;\nfor by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be\nsatisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe\nwe are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait\nshould show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur\nfrom the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all\nin her favour that you desire.\"\n\n\"She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\" said Don Quixote, burning\nwith rage, \"nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet in\ncotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a\nGuadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered\nagainst beauty like that of my lady.\"\n\nAnd so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had\nspoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived\nthat Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone\nhard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master,\nrolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he\nwas unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and\nthe weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get\nup he kept saying, \"Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my\nfault, but my horse's, am I stretched here.\"\n\n\n\n\nOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good\nnature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,\nwas unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming\nup to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one\nof them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and\nin spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His\nmasters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the\nmuleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until he had\nvented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of\nthe lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy victim, who all\nthrough the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threatening\nheaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last\nthe muleteer was tired, and the traders continued their journey, taking\nwith them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled.\nHe when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he was\nunable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having been\nthrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself\nfortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant's\nmishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However,\nbattered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nIN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT'S MISHAP IS CONTINUED\n\n\nFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of\nhaving recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage\nin his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and\nthe Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountain\nside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young\nmen, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a\nwhit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit\nexactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe\nsuffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat\nthe very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have\nuttered:\n\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\n  My sorrow dost not rue?\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\n  Or else thou art untrue.\n\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\n\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\n  My Uncle and liege lord!\n\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to\ncome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been\nwith a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,\ncame up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him\nthat he complained so dolefully.\n\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his\nuncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which\nhe told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor's son\nand his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\n\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of\nthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which\nwas covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him\nand said, \"Senor Quixada\" (for so he appears to have been called when he\nwas in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman\ninto a knight-errant), \"who has brought your worship to this pass?\" But\nto all questions the other only went on with his ballad.\n\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and\nbackpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor\nany mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and\nwith no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him\nto be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the\nsplinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the\nbridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very\nsad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.\n\nNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not\nsit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,\nso that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it\ncould have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to\nmatch his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought\nhimself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo\nde Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that\nwhen the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave\nhim for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez\ngave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the \"Diana\"\nof Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case\nso aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to\nlisten to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the\nconclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the\nvillage to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote's;\nwho, at the end of it, said, \"Senor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship\nmust know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely\nDulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most\nfamous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be\nseen, or ever shall be seen.\"\n\nTo this the peasant answered, \"Senor--sinner that I am!--cannot your\nworship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of\nMantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither\nBaldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Senor Quixada?\"\n\n\"I know who I am,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I know that I may be not\nonly those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all\nthe Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done\nall together and each of them on his own account.\"\n\nWith this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as\nnight was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little\nlater that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a\nmiserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered\nthe village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found all in\nconfusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were\ngreat friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a\nloud voice, \"What does your worship think can have befallen my master,\nSenor Licentiate Pero Perez?\" for so the curate was called; \"it is three\ndays now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the\nbuckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as\ntrue as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he\nhas, and has got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his\nreason; for now I remember having often heard him saying to himself that\nhe would turn knight-errant and go all over the world in quest of\nadventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought\nto ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!\"\n\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \"You must know, Master Nicholas\"--for\nthat was the name of the barber--\"it was often my uncle's way to stay two\ndays and nights together poring over these unholy books of misventures,\nafter which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall\nto slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he would say he had\nkilled four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him\nwhen he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in\nbattle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water and become calm\nand quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion which the\nsage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had brought him. But I\ntake all the blame upon myself for never having told your worships of my\nuncle's vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had\ncome to this pass, and burn all these accursed books--for he has a great\nnumber--that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\"\n\n\"So say I too,\" said the curate, \"and by my faith to-morrow shall not\npass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the\nflames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems\nto have behaved.\"\n\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was\nthe matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \"Open, your\nworships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes\nbadly wounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant\nRodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.\"\n\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their\nfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass\nbecause he could not, they ran to embrace him.\n\n\"Hold!\" said he, \"for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault; carry\nme to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to\nmy wounds.\"\n\n\"See there! plague on it!\" cried the housekeeper at this: \"did not my\nheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with\nyour worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without\nfetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more,\non those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a\npass.\"\n\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could\nfind none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe\nfall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest\nand the boldest to be found on earth.\n\n\"So, so!\" said the curate, \"are there giants in the dance? By the sign of\nthe Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day over.\"\n\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all\nwas--give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what\nhe needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at\ngreat length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the\nnonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the\nlicentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to\nsummon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don\nQuixote's house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nOF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER\nMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN\n\n\nHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the\nroom where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right\nwillingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and\nfound more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some\nother small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about\nand ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy\nwater and a sprinkler, saying, \"Here, your worship, senor licentiate,\nsprinkle this room; don't leave any magician of the many there are in\nthese books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them\nfrom the world.\"\n\nThe simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he\ndirected the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they\nwere about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not\ndeserve the penalty of fire.\n\n\"No,\" said the niece, \"there is no reason for showing mercy to any of\nthem; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out of\nthe window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them;\nor else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without\nthe smoke giving any annoyance.\" The housekeeper said the same, so eager\nwere they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would\nnot agree to it without first reading at any rate the titles.\n\nThe first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \"The four books of\nAmadis of Gaul.\" \"This seems a mysterious thing,\" said the curate, \"for,\nas I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in\nSpain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin; so it\nseems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames as the\nfounder of so vile a sect.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir,\" said the barber, \"I too, have heard say that this is the best\nof all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as\nsomething singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason let its life be spared for\nthe present. Let us see that other which is next to it.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said the barber, \"the 'Sergas de Esplandian,' the lawful son of\nAmadis of Gaul.\"\n\n\"Then verily,\" said the curate, \"the merit of the father must not be put\ndown to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open the\nwindow and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for\nthe bonfire we are to make.\"\n\nThe housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy\n\"Esplandian\" went flying into the yard to await with all patience the\nfire that was in store for him.\n\n\"Proceed,\" said the curate.\n\n\"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is 'Amadis of Greece,' and,\nindeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.\"\n\n\"Then to the yard with the whole of them,\" said the curate; \"for to have\nthe burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and his\neclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I\nwould burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in\nthe guise of a knight-errant.\"\n\n\"I am of the same mind,\" said the barber.\n\n\"And so am I,\" added the niece.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the housekeeper, \"here, into the yard with them!\"\n\nThey were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared\nherself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.\n\n\"Who is that tub there?\" said the curate.\n\n\"This,\" said the barber, \"is 'Don Olivante de Laura.'\"\n\n\"The author of that book,\" said the curate, \"was the same that wrote 'The\nGarden of Flowers,' and truly there is no deciding which of the two books\nis the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say\nis, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.\"\n\n\"This that follows is 'Florismarte of Hircania,'\" said the barber.\n\n\"Senor Florismarte here?\" said the curate; \"then by my faith he must take\nup his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and\nvisionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve\nnothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress\nhousekeeper.\"\n\n\"With all my heart, senor,\" said she, and executed the order with great\ndelight.\n\n\"This,\" said the barber, \"is The Knight Platir.'\"\n\n\"An old book that,\" said the curate, \"but I find no reason for clemency\nin it; send it after the others without appeal;\" which was done.\n\nAnother book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, \"The Knight of the\nCross.\"\n\n\"For the sake of the holy name this book has,\" said the curate, \"its\nignorance might be excused; but then, they say, 'behind the cross there's\nthe devil; to the fire with it.\"\n\nTaking down another book, the barber said, \"This is 'The Mirror of\nChivalry.'\"\n\n\"I know his worship,\" said the curate; \"that is where Senor Reinaldos of\nMontalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves than\nCacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian\nTurpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual\nbanishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention\nof the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico\nAriosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any\nlanguage but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks\nhis own tongue I will put him upon my head.\"\n\n\"Well, I have him in Italian,\" said the barber, \"but I do not understand\nhim.\"\n\n\"Nor would it be well that you should understand him,\" said the curate,\n\"and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not\nbrought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a\ngreat deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn\nbooks written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains\nthey take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the\nlevel of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say that\nthis book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs,\nshould be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more\nconsideration it is settled what is to be done with them; excepting\nalways one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and another called\n'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands, shall pass at once\ninto those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any\nreprieve.\"\n\nTo all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and\nproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and\nloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed\nto them. Opening another book he saw it was \"Palmerin de Oliva,\" and\nbeside it was another called \"Palmerin of England,\" seeing which the\nlicentiate said, \"Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned\nuntil no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and\npreserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made\nfor it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set\naside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book,\ngossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very good,\nand secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise and witty\nking of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are\nexcellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and\nclear, studying and observing the style befitting the speaker with\npropriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to you, Master\nNicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remitted the penalty of\nfire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without further question\nor query.\"\n\n\"Nay, gossip,\" said the barber, \"for this that I have here is the famous\n'Don Belianis.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the curate, \"that and the second, third, and fourth parts\nall stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and\nthey must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other\ngreater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas\nterm, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out\nto them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and\nlet no one read them.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with\nreading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all the\nbig ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or\ndeaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest\nand finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she\nflung them out of the window.\n\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber,\nwho took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, \"History\nof the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" said the curate with a shout, \"'Tirante el Blanco' here!\nHand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury of\nenjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan,\na valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight\nFonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and\nthe witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of\nthe widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito--in\ntruth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.\nHere knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills\nbefore dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all the\nother books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately\ncomposing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life.\nTake it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have said\nis true.\"\n\n\"As you will,\" said the barber; \"but what are we to do with these little\nbooks that are left?\"\n\n\"These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\" said the curate; and opening\none he saw it was the \"Diana\" of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing all\nthe others to be of the same sort, \"these,\" he said, \"do not deserve to\nbe burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief\nthe books of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can\nhurt no one.\"\n\n\"Ah, senor!\" said the niece, \"your worship had better order these to be\nburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being\ncured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy\nto turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or,\nwhat would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurable\nand infectious malady.\"\n\n\"The damsel is right,\" said the curate, \"and it will be well to put this\nstumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way. To begin, then,\nwith the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned,\nbut that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the\nmagic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep,\nand welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the\nkind.\"\n\n\"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is the 'Diana,' entitled the\n'Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title, and\nits author is Gil Polo.\"\n\n\"As for that of the Salamancan,\" replied the curate, \"let it go to swell\nthe number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be preserved\nas if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste,\nfor it is growing late.\"\n\n\"This book,\" said the barber, opening another, \"is the ten books of the\n'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\"\n\n\"By the orders I have received,\" said the curate, \"since Apollo has been\nApollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so\ndroll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it\nis the best and the most singular of all of this species that have as yet\nappeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what\nis delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having\nfound it than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.\"\n\nHe put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, \"These\nthat come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of Henares,' and\n'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'\"\n\n\"Then all we have to do,\" said the curate, \"is to hand them over to the\nsecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never\nhave done.\"\n\n\"This next is the 'Pastor de Filida.'\"\n\n\"No Pastor that,\" said the curate, \"but a highly polished courtier; let\nit be preserved as a precious jewel.\"\n\n\"This large one here,\" said the barber, \"is called 'The Treasury of\nvarious Poems.'\"\n\n\"If there were not so many of them,\" said the curate, \"they would be more\nrelished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgarities\nwhich it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author\nis a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier\nworks that he has written.\"\n\n\"This,\" continued the barber, \"is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de\nMaldonado.\"\n\n\"The author of that book, too,\" said the curate, \"is a great friend of\nmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who\nhear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when\nhe chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is\ngood was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been\nset apart. But what book is that next it?\"\n\n\"The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,\" said the barber.\n\n\"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my\nknowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His book\nhas some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings\nnothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises:\nperhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of\ngrace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, senor gossip,\nkeep it shut up in your own quarters.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the barber; \"and here come three together, the\n'Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan Rufo,\nJustice of Cordova, and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Virues, the\nValencian poet.\"\n\n\"These three books,\" said the curate, \"are the best that have been\nwritten in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most\nfamous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry\nthat Spain possesses.\"\n\nThe curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he\ndecided that, \"contents uncertified,\" all the rest should be burned; but\njust then the barber held open one, called \"The Tears of Angelica.\"\n\n\"I should have shed tears myself,\" said the curate when he heard the\ntitle, \"had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of\nthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in\nthe translation of some of Ovid's fables.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nOF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\n\n\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \"Here, here, valiant\nknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms,\nfor they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!\" Called\naway by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the\nscrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that \"The Carolea,\"\n\"The Lion of Spain,\" and \"The Deeds of the Emperor,\" written by Don Luis\nde Avila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were\namong those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they\nwould not have undergone so severe a sentence.\n\nWhen they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still\nshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as\nif he had never slept.\n\nThey closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had\nbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, \"Of a truth,\nSenor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves\nthe Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain\nthe victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the\nhonour on the three former days.\"\n\n\"Hush, gossip,\" said the curate; \"please God, the luck may turn, and what\nis lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship\nhave a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are\nover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\"\n\n\"Wounded no,\" said Don Quixote, \"but bruised and battered no doubt, for\nthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,\nand all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his\nachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he\nnot pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise from\nthis bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I\nfeel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge\nmyself.\"\n\nThey did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he\nfell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.\n\nThat night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the\nyard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that\ndeserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the\nlaziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified\nthe proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.\n\nOne of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied\nto their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the\nbooks were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the\ncause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a\nmagician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all\ndespatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did\nwas to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had\nleft it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the\nplace where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned\nand twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after\na good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held\nhis books.\n\nThe housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to\nanswer, said, \"What room or what nothing is it that your worship is\nlooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the\ndevil himself has carried all away.\"\n\n\"It was not the devil,\" said the niece, \"but a magician who came on a\ncloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting\nfrom a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I\nknow not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof,\nand left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had\ndone we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the\nhousekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice\nthat, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room,\nhe had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he\nsaid too that his name was the Sage Munaton.\"\n\n\"He must have said Friston,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I don't know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\" said the\nhousekeeper, \"I only know that his name ended with 'ton.'\"\n\n\"So it does,\" said Don Quixote, \"and he is a sage magician, a great enemy\nof mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore\nthat in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight\nwhom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to\nprevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns\nthat he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid\nwhat is decreed by Heaven.\"\n\n\"Who doubts that?\" said the niece; \"but, uncle, who mixes you up in these\nquarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house\ninstead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of\nwheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\"\n\n\"Oh, niece of mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"how much astray art thou in\nthy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped\noff the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.\"\n\nThe two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his\nanger was kindling.\n\nIn short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without\nshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and\nduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the\ncurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant\nwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be\naccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes\ncontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed\nthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.\n\nMeanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an\nhonest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but\nwith very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and\nwith such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind\nto sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among\nother things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly,\nbecause any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in\nthe twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the\nlike promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and\nchildren, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.\n\nDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and\npawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together\na fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan\nfrom a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he\nwarned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he\nmight provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he\ncharged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that\nhe meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to\ngoing on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying\nwhether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an\nesquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For\nall that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him\nwith a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by\nappropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered.\nHimself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could,\naccording to the advice the host had given him; all which being done,\nwithout taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don\nQuixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by\nanybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course\nof it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even\nshould search be made for them.\n\nSancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and\nlonging to see himself soon governor of the island his master had\npromised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he\nhad taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he\ntravelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was\nearly morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat\ndid not distress them.\n\nAnd now said Sancho Panza to his master, \"Your worship will take care,\nSenor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,\nfor be it ever so big I'll be equal to governing it.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that\nit was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to\nmake their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I\nam determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a\ncustom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes,\nand perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and\nthen when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights,\nthey gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of\nsome valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it\nmay well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom\nthat has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable\nthee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this\nwonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways\nso unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than\nI promise thee.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of\nthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old\nwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\"\n\n\"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded\nthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them\nwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she is not\nworth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that\nonly with God's help.\"\n\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give her\nwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to\nbe content with anything less than being governor of a province.\"\n\n\"I will not, senor,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of such\nquality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all\nthat will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nOF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND\nUNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO\nBE FITLY RECORDED\n\n\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are\non plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire,\n\"Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our\ndesires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or\nmore monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in\nbattle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our\nfortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to\nsweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\"\n\n\"What giants?\" said Sancho Panza.\n\n\"Those thou seest there,\" answered his master, \"with the long arms, and\nsome have them nearly two leagues long.\"\n\n\"Look, your worship,\" said Sancho; \"what we see there are not giants but\nwindmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by\nthe wind make the millstone go.\"\n\n\"It is easy to see,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that thou art not used to this\nbusiness of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away\nwith thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in\nfierce and unequal combat.\"\n\nSo saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries\nhis squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they\nwere windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so\npositive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor\nperceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting,\n\"Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\"\n\nA slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to\nmove, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Though ye flourish more arms\nthan the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\"\n\nSo saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady\nDulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in\nrest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop\nand fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove\nhis lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force\nthat it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider,\nwho went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened\nto his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found\nhim unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.\n\n\"God bless me!\" said Sancho, \"did I not tell your worship to mind what\nyou were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made\nany mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his\nhead.\"\n\n\"Hush, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"the fortunes of war more\nthan any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think,\nand it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study\nand books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the\nglory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end\nhis wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\"\n\n\"God order it as he may,\" said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got\nhim up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,\ndiscussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,\nfor there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in\nabundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he\nwas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,\nhe added, \"I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de\nVargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a\nponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and\npounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his\ndescendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention\nthis because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch,\nlarge and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do\nsuch deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found\nworthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will\nwith difficulty be believed.\"\n\n\"Be that as God will,\" said Sancho, \"I believe it all as your worship\nsays it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side,\nmay be from the shaking of the fall.\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if I make no complaint of the\npain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any\nwound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\"\n\n\"If so,\" said Sancho, \"I have nothing to say; but God knows I would\nrather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I\nconfess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule\nabout not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\"\n\nDon Quixote could not help laughing at his squire's simplicity, and he\nassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he\nliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the\norder of knighthood.\n\nSancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered\nthat he wanted nothing himself just then, but that he might eat when he\nhad a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as\nhe could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed\naway in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately,\nand from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the\nthirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in\nthis way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to\nany of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as\nhardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however\ndangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees,\nfrom one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a\nfashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the\nbroken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady\nDulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many\na night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless\nsupported by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza\nspend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory\nwater he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him,\nneither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes\nof the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken\nhim. On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than\nthe night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be\non the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to\nbreak his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to\nsavoury recollections for nourishment.\n\nThey returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto\nLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \"Here,\nbrother Sancho Panza,\" said Don Quixote when he saw it, \"we may plunge\nour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,\neven shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must\nnot put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest\nthat those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou\nmayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account\npermitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou\nhast been dubbed a knight.\"\n\n\"Most certainly, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"your worship shall be fully\nobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no\nfriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\ndefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for\nlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any\nassailant whatever.\"\n\n\"That I grant,\" said Don Quixote, \"but in this matter of aiding me\nagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.\"\n\n\"I will do so, I promise you,\" answered Sancho, \"and will keep this\nprecept as carefully as Sunday.\"\n\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the\norder of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were\nthe two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried\nsunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons\non horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as\nafterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her\nhusband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of\nhigh honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in her\ncompany; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire,\n\"Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure\nthat has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and\ndoubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in\nthat coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.\"\n\n\"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \"Look, senor; those\nare friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\ntravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let the\ndevil mislead you.\"\n\n\"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that on the\nsubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\nthou shalt see presently.\"\n\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along\nwhich the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come\nnear enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and unnatural\nbeings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying\noff by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the\njust punishment of your evil deeds.\"\n\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote\nas well as at his words, to which they replied, \"Senor Caballero, we are\nnot devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our\nroad, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses\ncoming in this coach.\"\n\n\"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" said Don Quixote,\nand without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelled\nlance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if\nthe friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him\nto the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.\nThe second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels\ninto his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the\nwind.\n\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly\nfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that\ninstant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him\nfor. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the\nbattle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea\nof a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils,\nseeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers\nin the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a\nhair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched\nbreathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped\nthe friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he\nfound himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was\nstanding at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught;\nthen, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they\npursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil\nafter them.\n\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\n\"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he, \"may now dispose of your person as may\nbe most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers\nlies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest\nyou should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am\ncalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and\ncaptive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in\nreturn for the service you have received of me I ask no more than that\nyou should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before\nthat lady and tell her what I have done to set you free.\"\n\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\nlistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\nnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El\nToboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\nCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \"Begone, caballero, and\nill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\nslayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\"\n\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \"If\nthou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy\nfolly and rashness, miserable creature.\" To which the Biscayan returned,\n\"I no gentleman!--I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou\ndroppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying\nwater to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil,\nand look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.\"\n\n\"'\"You will see presently,\" said Agrajes,'\" replied Don Quixote; and\nthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler on\nhis arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\n\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\nfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire,\nhe had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky\nfor him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to\nsnatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one\nanother as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make\npeace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his\ndisjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would\nkill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in\nthe coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to\ndraw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in\nthe course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the\nshoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one without armour,\nwould have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of\nthis prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \"O lady of my soul, Dulcinea,\nflower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling\nhis obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.\" To\nsay this, to lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler,\nand to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he\nwas to venture all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on\nin this way, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and\nresolved to follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under\ncover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with\nhis mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\nnot stir a step.\n\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with\nuplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on\nhis side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the\nprotection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in\nsuspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in\nthe coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and\nofferings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver\nher squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found\nthemselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author\nof the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he\ncould find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote\nthan what has been already set forth. It is true the second author of\nthis work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have\nbeen allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of\nLa Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their\narchives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight;\nand this being his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the\nconclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him, he did\nfind in a way that shall be related in the Second Part.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nIN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE\nGALLANT BISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN\n\nIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the\nrenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two\nsuch furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they\nwould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid\nthem open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the\ndelightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any\nintimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.\n\nThis distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read\nsuch a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance\nthat presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me,\nwas missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing\nimpossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should\nhave been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his\nmarvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those\nknights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of\nthem had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded\ntheir deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies,\nhowever secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been\nso unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in\nabundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant\ntale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time,\nthe devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or\nconsumed it.\n\nOn the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there\nhad been found such modern ones as \"The Enlightenment of Jealousy\" and\nthe \"Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\" his story must likewise be modern,\nand that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of\nthe people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This\nreflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the\nwhole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La\nMancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our\nage and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise\nof the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and\nprotecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on\ntheir palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to\nmountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some ruffian, or\nboor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there\nwere in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all\nwhich time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves\nas much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these\nand other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and\nnotable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and\npains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history;\nthough I know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped\nme, the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and\npleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall\nread it attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.\n\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some\npamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading\neven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of\nmine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it\nwas in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to\nread them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there\nwere any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was\nthere any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I\nsought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In\nshort, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and\nput the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a\nlittle in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he\nreplied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by\nway of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \"In\nthe margin, as I told you, this is written: 'This Dulcinea del Toboso so\noften mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any\nwoman in all La Mancha for salting pigs.'\"\n\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and\namazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained\nthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the\nbeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he\ntold me it meant, \"History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide\nHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\" It required great caution to hide\nthe joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching\nit from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the\nboy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known\nhow eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more\nthan six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into\nthe cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets\nthat related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting\nor adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He\nwas satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and\npromised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make\nthe matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I\ntook him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he\ntranslated the whole just as it is set down here.\n\nIn the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was\ndrawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history\ndescribes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the\nother by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to nature that it\ncould be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an\ninscription under his feet which said, \"Don Sancho de Azpeitia,\" which no\ndoubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another\nthat said, \"Don Quixote.\" Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long\nand thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in\nconsumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the\nname of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza\nholding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,\n\"Sancho Zancas,\" and according to the picture, he must have had a big\nbelly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the\nnames of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the\nhistory several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be\nmentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do\nwith the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long\nas it is true.\n\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its\ntruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very\ncommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than\nadditions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for,\nwhere he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy\na knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which\nis ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of\nhistorians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and\nneither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from\nthe path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of\ndeeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and\nwarning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be\ndesired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I\nmaintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of\nthe subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation,\nbegan in this way:\n\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though\nthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and\nearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear\nthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was\ndelivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its\ncourse, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the\nbitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good\nfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword of\nhis adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it\ndid him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying\naway a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all which with\nfearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.\n\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled\nthe heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this\nfashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised\nhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both\nhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over\nthe cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield proving\nuseless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose,\nmouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as\nno doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at\nthe same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then\nunclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow,\nmade off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the\nground. Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him\nfall, leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and,\npresenting the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he\nwould cut his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable\nto answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don\nQuixote, had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching\nthe combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him\nwith earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of\nsparing their squire's life; to which Don Quixote replied with much\ngravity and dignity, \"In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what\nye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is\nthat this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my\nbehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal\nwith him as shall be most pleasing to her.\"\n\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's\ndemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should\ndo all that had been commanded.\n\n\"Then, on the faith of that promise,\" said Don Quixote, \"I shall do him\nno further harm, though he well deserves it of me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nOF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE\nSANCHO PANZA\n\n\nNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of\nthe friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, Don\nQuixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to\ngrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make\nhim governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the struggle\nwas now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, he\napproached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he\nwent on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, \"May\nit please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of\nthat island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big\nI feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as\nwell as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must take notice, brother Sancho,\nthat this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but\nof cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear\nthe less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from\nwhich I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.\"\n\nSancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of\nhis hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself,\nproceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking\nleave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach,\nturned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass's\nbest trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind,\nhe was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so,\nreining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him\nsaid, \"It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take\nrefuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has\nbeen left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to\nthe Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we\ncome out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\"\n\n\"Peace,\" said Don Quixote; \"where hast thou ever seen or heard that a\nknight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many\nhomicides he may have committed?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about omecils,\" answered Sancho, \"nor in my life have had\nanything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks\nafter those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not\nmeddle.\"\n\n\"Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for\nI will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of\nthose of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a\nmore valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in\nhistory of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in\nmaintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" answered Sancho, \"that I have never read any history, for\nI can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a\nmore daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days\nof my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have\nsaid; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal\nof blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little\nwhite ointment in the alforjas.\"\n\n\"All that might be well dispensed with,\" said Don Quixote, \"if I had\nremembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and\nmedicine are saved by one single drop.\"\n\n\"What vial and what balsam is that?\" said Sancho Panza.\n\n\"It is a balsam,\" answered Don Quixote, \"the receipt of which I have in\nmy memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of\nany wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to\ndo when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the\nmiddle of the body--as is wont to happen frequently,--but neatly and with\ngreat nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body\nwhich shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains\nin the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Then thou\nshalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned, and\nthou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.\"\n\n\"If that be so,\" said Panza, \"I renounce henceforth the government of the\npromised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and\nfaithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this\nsupreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals\nan ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease\nand honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.\"\n\n\"With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"Sinner that I am!\" said Sancho, \"then why does your worship put off\nmaking it and teaching it to me?\"\n\n\"Peace, friend,\" answered Don Quixote; \"greater secrets I mean to teach\nthee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us\nsee to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.\"\n\nSancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don\nQuixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses,\nand clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be\nsaid, \"I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their\nfullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to\navenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread\nfrom a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though\nI cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take\ncomplete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against\nme.\"\n\nHearing this, Sancho said to him, \"Your worship should bear in mind,\nSenor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in\ngoing to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have\ndone all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment\nunless he commits some new offence.\"\n\n\"Thou hast said well and hit the point,\" answered Don Quixote; and so I\nrecall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,\nbut I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such\ntime as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and\nas good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw in\ndoing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same\nthing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino's helmet, which cost\nSacripante so dear.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"let your worship send all such oaths to the\ndevil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the\nconscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with\nno man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed\nin spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep in\nyour clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other\nmortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis of\nMantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship\nobserve that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads,\nnothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, but\nperhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.\"\n\n\"Thou art wrong there,\" said Don Quixote, \"for we shall not have been\nabove two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armour\nthan came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Sancho; \"so be it then, and God grant us success, and that\nthe time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may soon\ncome, and then let me die.\"\n\n\"I have already told thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"not to give\nthyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail, there\nis the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring\nfits the finger, and all the more that, being on terra firma, thou wilt\nall the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that to its own time; see\nif thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas, because we must\npresently go in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make\nthe balsam I told thee of, for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving\nme great pain.\"\n\n\"I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,\"\nsaid Sancho, \"but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like\nyour worship.\"\n\n\"How little thou knowest about it,\" answered Don Quixote; \"I would have\nthee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go\nwithout eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be\nof what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst\nthou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very many,\namong them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating,\nunless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and\nthe rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it is plain\nthey could not do without eating and performing all the other natural\nfunctions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain\ntoo that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives through\nwoods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic\nviands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not\nthat distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world\nor pervert knight-errantry.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"for, as I cannot read or write,\nas I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of the\nprofession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with every\nkind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself,\nas I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other things more\nsubstantial.\"\n\n\"I do not say, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that it is imperative on\nknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of;\nonly that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they\nfound in the fields which they knew and I know too.\"\n\n\"A good thing it is,\" answered Sancho, \"to know those herbs, for to my\nthinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into\npractice.\"\n\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their\nrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the\nnight, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted\nat once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but\ndaylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by\nthe huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,\nand it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as\nit was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for\nhe fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of\nownership that helped to prove his chivalry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nWHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS\n\n\nHe was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he\ncould put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came\nfrom some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and\nthough he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be\ntransferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as\nthe goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the\nground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty\ngood-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins six\nof the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with\nrough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which\nthey placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho\nremained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him\nstanding, his master said to him:\n\n\"That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in\nitself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to\nbe speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat\nthyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and\nthat thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that\nthou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same\nmay be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.\"\n\n\"Great thanks,\" said Sancho, \"but I may tell your worship that provided I\nhave enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by\nmyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth is\nto be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much more\nrelish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys of\nthose other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe\nmy mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do other\nthings that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, senor, as for\nthese honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant and\nfollower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may be\nof more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledge\nthem as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.\"\n\n\"For all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou must seat thyself, because him\nwho humbleth himself God exalteth;\" and seizing him by the arm he forced\nhim to sit down beside himself.\n\nThe goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and\nknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at their\nguests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces as\nbig as one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon the\nsheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down a\nhalf cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while the\nhorn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty,\nlike the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the two\nwine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased his\nappetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating them\nattentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:\n\n\"Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of\ngolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this our\niron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knew\nnot the two words \"mine\" and \"thine\"! In that blessed age all things were\nin common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to\nstretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood\ngenerously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams\nand running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble\nabundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts\nof the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the\nplenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork\ntrees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark\nthat served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a\nprotection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace,\nall friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough\nhad not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother\nthat without compulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile\nbosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then\npossessed her. Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess\nroamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no\nmore garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and\never sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments like those in use to-day,\nset off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the\nwreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely\nand becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and\nfar-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them. Then the\nlove-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves simply and naturally as the\nheart conceived them, nor sought to commend themselves by forced and\nrambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice had then not yet mingled with\ntruth and sincerity. Justice held her ground, undisturbed and unassailed\nby the efforts of favour and of interest, that now so much impair,\npervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in\nthe mind of the judge, for then there was no cause to judge and no one to\nbe judged. Maidens and modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone\nand unattended, without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine\nassault, and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure.\nBut now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not though some new\nlabyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even there the\npestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on\nthe air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all\nseclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and\nwickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to\ndefend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the\nneedy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks\nfor the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for\nthough by natural law all living are bound to show favour to\nknights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have\nwelcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my\npower I should thank you for yours.\"\n\nAll this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our\nknight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the\ngolden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary\nargument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement\nwithout saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate\nacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they had\nhung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.\n\nDon Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the\nend of which one of the goatherds said, \"That your worship, senor\nknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with\nready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of\nour comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very\nintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and\nwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection.\"\n\nThe goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck\nreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very\ngood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him if\nhe had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already made\nthe offer said to him:\n\n\"In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing\na little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the\nmountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy\naccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say\ntrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy\nlove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked\nin the town.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the young man, and without waiting for more\npressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his\nrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.\n\nANTONIO'S BALLAD\n\nThou dost love me well, Olalla;\n  Well I know it, even though\nLove's mute tongues, thine eyes, have never\n  By their glances told me so.\n\nFor I know my love thou knowest,\n  Therefore thine to claim I dare:\nOnce it ceases to be secret,\n  Love need never feel despair.\n\nTrue it is, Olalla, sometimes\n  Thou hast all too plainly shown\nThat thy heart is brass in hardness,\n  And thy snowy bosom stone.\n\nYet for all that, in thy coyness,\n  And thy fickle fits between,\nHope is there--at least the border\n  Of her garment may be seen.\n\nLures to faith are they, those glimpses,\n  And to faith in thee I hold;\nKindness cannot make it stronger,\n  Coldness cannot make it cold.\n\nIf it be that love is gentle,\n  In thy gentleness I see\nSomething holding out assurance\n  To the hope of winning thee.\n\nIf it be that in devotion\n  Lies a power hearts to move,\nThat which every day I show thee,\n  Helpful to my suit should prove.\n\nMany a time thou must have noticed--\n  If to notice thou dost care--\nHow I go about on Monday\n  Dressed in all my Sunday wear.\n\nLove's eyes love to look on brightness;\n  Love loves what is gaily drest;\nSunday, Monday, all I care is\n  Thou shouldst see me in my best.\n\nNo account I make of dances,\n  Or of strains that pleased thee so,\nKeeping thee awake from midnight\n  Till the cocks began to crow;\n\nOr of how I roundly swore it\n  That there's none so fair as thou;\nTrue it is, but as I said it,\n  By the girls I'm hated now.\n\nFor Teresa of the hillside\n  At my praise of thee was sore;\nSaid, \"You think you love an angel;\n  It's a monkey you adore;\n\n\"Caught by all her glittering trinkets,\n  And her borrowed braids of hair,\nAnd a host of made-up beauties\n  That would Love himself ensnare.\"\n\n'T was a lie, and so I told her,\n  And her cousin at the word\nGave me his defiance for it;\n  And what followed thou hast heard.\n\nMine is no high-flown affection,\n  Mine no passion par amours--\nAs they call it--what I offer\n  Is an honest love, and pure.\n\nCunning cords the holy Church has,\n  Cords of softest silk they be;\nPut thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;\n  Mine will follow, thou wilt see.\n\nElse--and once for all I swear it\n  By the saint of most renown--\nIf I ever quit the mountains,\n  'T will be in a friar's gown.\n\nHere the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote\nentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more\ninclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master,\n\"Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the\nnight, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them\nto spend the night in singing.\"\n\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I perceive clearly\nthat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather\nthan in music.\"\n\n\"It's sweet to us all, blessed be God,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but settle thyself where thou\nwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than\nin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for\nme again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\"\n\nSancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,\ntold him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would\nbe soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was\na great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt,\nand applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage,\nassuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nOF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE\n\n\nJust then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions\nfrom the village, came up and said, \"Do you know what is going on in the\nvillage, comrades?\"\n\n\"How could we know it?\" replied one of them.\n\n\"Well, then, you must know,\" continued the young man, \"this morning that\nfamous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured that\nhe died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of\nGuillermo the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress of\na shepherdess.\"\n\n\"You mean Marcela?\" said one.\n\n\"Her I mean,\" answered the goatherd; \"and the best of it is, he has\ndirected in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,\nand at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as\nthe story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place\nwhere he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the\nclergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because they\nsavour of paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio the student,\nhe who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies that\neverything must be done without any omission according to the directions\nleft by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all in commotion;\nhowever, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and all the shepherds\nhis friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they are coming to bury\nhim with great ceremony where I said. I am sure it will be something\nworth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see it even if I knew I\nshould not return to the village tomorrow.\"\n\n\"We will do the same,\" answered the goatherds, \"and cast lots to see who\nmust stay to mind the goats of all.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest well, Pedro,\" said one, \"though there will be no need of\ntaking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don't suppose it\nis virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that ran\ninto my foot the other day will not let me walk.\"\n\n\"For all that, we thank thee,\" answered Pedro.\n\nDon Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the\nshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead\nman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,\nwho had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\nhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and\ndeeply read. \"Above all, they said, he was learned in the science of the\nstars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon,\nfor he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time.\"\n\n\"Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\nluminaries,\" said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\ntrifles, went on with his story, saying, \"Also he foretold when the year\nwas going to be one of abundance or estility.\"\n\n\"Sterility, you mean,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Sterility or estility,\" answered Pedro, \"it is all the same in the end.\nAnd I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him\ngrew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them 'sow\nbarley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley;\nthe next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a\ndrop will be got.'\"\n\n\"That science is called astrology,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I do not know what it is called,\" replied Pedro, \"but I know that he\nknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months had\npassed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed\nas a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown\nhe wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio by\nname, who had been his companion in his studies, took to the shepherd's\ndress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great\nman for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve,\nand plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted,\nand all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the two scholars\nso unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's dress, they were lost in wonder,\nand could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change.\nAbout this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir\nto a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small\nnumber of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the\nyoung man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it\nall, for he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of\nworthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came\nto be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to\nwander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad\nmentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in\nlove. And I must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who\nthis girl is; perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have\nheard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live\nmore years than sarna.\"\n\n\"Say Sarra,\" said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's confusion\nof words.\n\n\"The sarna lives long enough,\" answered Pedro; \"and if, senor, you must\ngo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it\nthis twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, as there is such a\ndifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\nanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\nyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.\"\n\n\"I say then, my dear sir,\" said the goatherd, \"that in our village there\nwas a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named\nGuillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a\ndaughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected woman there\nwas in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that\ncountenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and\nmoreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the\npresent moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other world. Her\nhusband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving\nhis daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers,\na priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty\nthat it reminded us of her mother's, which was very great, and yet it was\nthought that the daughter's would exceed it; and so when she reached the\nage of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that\nhad made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her\npast redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement,\nbut for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for\nit as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and\nimportuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of\nthose many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them.\nBut he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in\nmarriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so\nwithout her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which\nthe custody of the girl's property brought him while he put off her\nmarriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more\nthan one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in\nthese little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped\nat, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above\ngood who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in\nvillages.\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote; \"but go on, for the story is very\ngood, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\"\n\n\"May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\" said Pedro; \"that is the one\nto have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his\nniece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the\nmany who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a\nchoice according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than\nthat she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did\nnot think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all\nappearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge\nher, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate\nherself to her own liking. For, said he--and he said quite right--parents\nare not to settle children in life against their will. But when one least\nlooked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes her\nappearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those\nof the town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the\nother shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so,\nsince she appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I\ncould not well tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants,\nhave adopted the costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making\nlove to her. One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased\nfriend, of whom they say that he did not love but adore her. But you must\nnot suppose, because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and\nindependence, and of so little or rather no retirement, that she has\ngiven any occasion, or even the semblance of one, for disparagement of\nher purity and modesty; on the contrary, such and so great is the\nvigilance with which she watches over her honour, that of all those that\ncourt and woo her not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, that she\nhas given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire. For\nalthough she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the\nshepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of them\ncome to declare his intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy\nas that of matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with\nthis kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the\nplague had got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the\nhearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but\nher scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so\nthey know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and\nhard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe the\nnature of her character; and if you should remain here any time, senor,\nyou would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\nrejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\nthere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of them\nbut has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and\nabove some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say\nmore plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty.\nHere one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love\nsongs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of\nthe night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without\nhaving closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused\nand bereft of sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs,\nstretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer\nnoontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and\nthe other, over these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and\ncareless. And all of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride\nwill come to, and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming\na nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme. All\nthat I have told you being such well-established truth, I am persuaded\nthat what they say of the cause of Chrysostom's death, as our lad told\nus, is the same. And so I advise you, senor, fail not to be present\nto-morrow at his burial, which will be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom\nhad many friends, and it is not half a league from this place to where he\ndirected he should be buried.\"\n\n\"I will make a point of it,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I thank you for the\npleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the goatherd, \"I do not know even the half of what has\nhappened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in\nwith some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well\nfor you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your\nwound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of\nan untoward result.\"\n\nSancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on\nhis part begged his master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep. He did so,\nand passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in\nimitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself between\nRocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been\ndiscarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nIN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHER\nINCIDENTS\n\nBit hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the\neast, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell\nhim that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of\nChrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired nothing\nbetter, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he\ndid with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They\nhad not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they\nsaw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins\nand with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter\noleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along\nwith them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome\ntravelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them.\nCourteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the\nother which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound\nfor the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.\n\nOne of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, \"It seems\nto me, Senor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall\nincur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but be\njudging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the\ndead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.\"\n\n\"So I think too,\" replied Vivaldo, \"and I would delay not to say a day,\nbut four, for the sake of seeing it.\"\n\nDon Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and\nChrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had met\nthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they\nhad asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one\nof them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a\nshepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,\ntogether with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were\ngoing. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.\n\nThis conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was\ncalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go\narmed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote\nreplied, \"The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in\nany other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for\nsoft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for\nthose alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though\nunworthy, am the least of all.\"\n\nThe instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to\nsettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo\nproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.\n\n\"Have not your worships,\" replied Don Quixote, \"read the annals and\nhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King\nArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, with\nregard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over\nthat kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was\nchanged by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to\nreturn to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it\ncannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a\nraven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of\nchivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the amour\nof Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred, precisely\nas is there related, the go-between and confidante therein being the\nhighly honourable dame Quintanona, whence came that ballad so well known\nand widely spread in our Spain--\n\nO never surely was there knight\n  So served by hand of dame,\nAs served was he Sir Lancelot hight\n  When he from Britain came--\n\nwith all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and\nwar. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went on\nextending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world;\nand in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty Amadis of\nGaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and the\nvaliant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised\nTirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and\ntalked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece. This, then,\nsirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of\nhis chivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have\nmade profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I\nprofess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking\nadventures, resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most\nperilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy.\"\n\nBy these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of\nDon Quixote's being out of his senses and of the form of madness that\novermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt\non first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person of\ngreat shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile the\nshort journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, the\nscene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with\nhis absurdities. So he said to him, \"It seems to me, Senor Knight-errant,\nthat your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions\nin the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so\naustere.\"\n\n\"As austere it may perhaps be,\" replied our Don Quixote, \"but so\nnecessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the\ntruth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders\ndoes no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,\nis, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of\nthe world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray\nfor, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords,\nnot under shelter but in the open air, a target for the intolerable rays\nof the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God's\nministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein. And\nas the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be\nconducted without exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows\nthat those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than\nthose who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to\nhelp the weak. I do not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts,\nthat the knight-errant's calling is as good as that of the monk in his\ncell; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a\ndoubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and\nthirstier, a wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to\ndoubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course\nof their lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise\nto be emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and\nsweat; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and\nsages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their\nambition and disappointed in their hopes.\"\n\n\"That is my own opinion,\" replied the traveller; \"but one thing among\nmany others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that\nwhen they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous\nadventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they\nnever at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to\nGod, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of\nwhich they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if\nthese were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of\nheathenism.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that cannot be on any account omitted, and\nthe knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual\nand customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging\nin any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes\ntowards her softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her to\nfavour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake,\nand even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words between\nhis teeth, commending himself to her with all his heart, and of this we\nhave innumerable instances in the histories. Nor is it to be supposed\nfrom this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there\nwill be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their\ntask.\"\n\n\"For all that,\" answered the traveller, \"I feel some doubt still, because\noften I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and\nfrom one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and\nthey wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then\nwithout any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge,\nand in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies;\nand what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the\nhaunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist's\nlance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his\nhorse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead\nman had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work\nas this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in\ncommending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been\ndevoted to his duty and obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my\nbelief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to,\nfor they are not all in love.\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" said Don Quixote: \"I say it is impossible that\nthere could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as\nnatural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most\ncertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a\nknight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without\none he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had\ngained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the\ndoor, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the traveller, \"if I remember rightly, I think I\nhave read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,\nnever had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he\nwas not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.\"\n\nTo which our Don Quixote made answer, \"Sir, one solitary swallow does not\nmake summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply in\nlove; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his\nfancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in short,\nit is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his\nwill, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly, for\nhe prided himself on being a reticent knight.\"\n\n\"Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,\"\nsaid the traveller, \"it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,\nas you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as\nreticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name\nof all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name, country,\nrank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if\nall the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your\nworship seems to be.\"\n\nAt this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I cannot say positively\nwhether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I\nserve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked\nof me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La\nMancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my\nqueen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and\nfanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are\nverified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her\neyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her\nteeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her\nfairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and\nimagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.\"\n\n\"We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,\" said Vivaldo.\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,\nCaii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the\nMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or\nVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,\nAlagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,\nMendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of\nPortugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that\nthough modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most\nillustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let none\ndispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot of\nthe trophy of Orlando's arms, saying,\n\n'These let none move Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.'\"\n\n\"Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,\" said the traveller, \"I\nwill not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,\nthough, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my\nears.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"has that never reached them?\"\n\nThe rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the\nconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds\nperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho\nPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing who\nhe was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any\ndifficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso,\nbecause neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his\nknowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were going along\nconversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high\nmountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool,\nand crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of\nthem of yew, some of cypress. Six of the number were carrying a bier\ncovered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one\nof the goatherds said, \"Those who come there are the bearers of\nChrysostom's body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he\nordered them to bury him.\" They therefore made haste to reach the spot,\nand did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground,\nand four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of\na hard rock. They greeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote\nand those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it,\ncovered with flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to\nall appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that\nin life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on\nthe bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded;\nand those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave\nand all the others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one\nof those who had borne the body said to another, \"Observe carefully,\nAmbrosia if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious\nthat what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.\"\n\n\"This is the place,\" answered Ambrosia \"for in it many a time did my poor\nfriend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told me,\nthat he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and\nhere, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as\nhonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela ended\nby scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched\nlife to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to\nbe laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.\" Then turning to Don Quixote\nand the travellers he went on to say, \"That body, sirs, on which you are\nlooking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heaven\nbestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body of Chrysostom, who\nwas unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentle\nbearing, a phoenix in friendship, generous without limit, grave without\narrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that\nconstitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune.\nHe loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he was scorned; he wooed a wild\nbeast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued the wind, he cried to the\nwilderness, he served ingratitude, and for reward was made the prey of\ndeath in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom he\nsought to immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see\ncould fully prove, had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire\nafter having consigned his body to the earth.\"\n\n\"You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner\nhimself,\" said Vivaldo, \"for it is neither right nor proper to do the\nwill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have\nbeen reasonable in Augustus Caesar had he permitted the directions left\nby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,\nSenor Ambrosia while you consign your friend's body to the earth, you\nshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order in\nbitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey\nit. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of\nMarcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men\nto shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have\ncome here know already the story of this your love-stricken and\nheart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of\nhis death, and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from\nwhich sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the\nlove of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the\nend awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens\nto their eyes. Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he\nwas to be buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct\nroad and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of\nhad so moved our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and\nour desire to prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you,\nexcellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my own account entreat you, that\ninstead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them.\"\n\nAnd without waiting for the shepherd's answer, he stretched out his hand\nand took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosio\nsaid, \"Out of courtesy, senor, I will grant your request as to those you\nhave taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the\nremainder.\"\n\nVivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of\nthem at once, and saw that its title was \"Lay of Despair.\"\n\nAmbrosio hearing it said, \"That is the last paper the unhappy man wrote;\nand that you may see, senor, to what an end his misfortunes brought him,\nread it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for that\nwhile we are waiting for the grave to be dug.\"\n\n\"I will do so very willingly,\" said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders\nwere equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud\nvoice, found that it ran as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nWHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD, TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FOR\n\n\nTHE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM\n\n  Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire\nThe ruthless rigour of thy tyranny\nFrom tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,\nThe very Hell will I constrain to lend\nThis stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe\nTo serve my need of fitting utterance.\nAnd as I strive to body forth the tale\nOf all I suffer, all that thou hast done,\nForth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along\nShreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.\nThen listen, not to dulcet harmony,\nBut to a discord wrung by mad despair\nOut of this bosom's depths of bitterness,\nTo ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.\n\n  The lion's roar, the fierce wolf's savage howl,\nThe horrid hissing of the scaly snake,\nThe awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,\nThe crow's ill-boding croak, the hollow moan\nOf wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,\nThe wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,\nThe plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,\nThe envied owl's sad note, the wail of woe\nThat rises from the dreary choir of Hell,\nCommingled in one sound, confusing sense,\nLet all these come to aid my soul's complaint,\nFor pain like mine demands new modes of song.\n\n  No echoes of that discord shall be heard\nWhere Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks\nOf olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks\nOr in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,\nAnd by a lifeless tongue in living words;\nOr in dark valleys or on lonely shores,\nWhere neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;\nOr in among the poison-breathing swarms\nOf monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.\nFor, though it be to solitudes remote\nThe hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound\nThy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate\nShall carry them to all the spacious world.\n\n  Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies\nSlain by suspicion, be it false or true;\nAnd deadly is the force of jealousy;\nLong absence makes of life a dreary void;\nNo hope of happiness can give repose\nTo him that ever fears to be forgot;\nAnd death, inevitable, waits in hall.\nBut I, by some strange miracle, live on\nA prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;\nRacked by suspicion as by certainty;\nForgotten, left to feed my flame alone.\nAnd while I suffer thus, there comes no ray\nOf hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;\nNor do I look for it in my despair;\nBut rather clinging to a cureless woe,\nAll hope do I abjure for evermore.\n\n  Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well,\nWhen far more certain are the grounds of fear?\nOught I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,\nIf through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?\nWho would not give free access to distrust,\nSeeing disdain unveiled, and--bitter change!--\nAll his suspicions turned to certainties,\nAnd the fair truth transformed into a lie?\nOh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,\nOh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,\nAnd bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.\nBut, woe is me! triumphant over all,\nMy sufferings drown the memory of you.\n\n  And now I die, and since there is no hope\nOf happiness for me in life or death,\nStill to my fantasy I'll fondly cling.\nI'll say that he is wise who loveth well,\nAnd that the soul most free is that most bound\nIn thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.\nI'll say that she who is mine enemy\nIn that fair body hath as fair a mind,\nAnd that her coldness is but my desert,\nAnd that by virtue of the pain he sends\nLove rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.\nThus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,\nAnd wearing out the wretched shred of life\nTo which I am reduced by her disdain,\nI'll give this soul and body to the winds,\nAll hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.\n\n  Thou whose injustice hath supplied the cause\nThat makes me quit the weary life I loathe,\nAs by this wounded bosom thou canst see\nHow willingly thy victim I become,\nLet not my death, if haply worth a tear,\nCloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;\nI would not have thee expiate in aught\nThe crime of having made my heart thy prey;\nBut rather let thy laughter gaily ring\nAnd prove my death to be thy festival.\nFool that I am to bid thee! well I know\nThy glory gains by my untimely end.\n\n  And now it is the time; from Hell's abyss\nCome thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus\nHeaving the cruel stone, come Tityus\nWith vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,\nAnd come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;\nAnd all into this breast transfer their pains,\nAnd (if such tribute to despair be due)\nChant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge\nOver a corse unworthy of a shroud.\nLet the three-headed guardian of the gate,\nAnd all the monstrous progeny of hell,\nThe doleful concert join: a lover dead\nMethinks can have no fitter obsequies.\n\n  Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone\nForth from this sorrowing heart: my misery\nBrings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;\nThen banish sadness even in the tomb.\n\n\nThe \"Lay of Chrysostom\" met with the approbation of the listeners, though\nthe reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of\nMarcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in it of\njealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the good name\nand fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who knew well his\nfriend's most secret thoughts, \"Senor, to remove that doubt I should tell\nyou that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from Marcela,\nfrom whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to try if absence would\nact with him as it is wont; and as everything distresses and every fear\nhaunts the banished lover, so imaginary jealousies and suspicions,\ndreaded as if they were true, tormented Chrysostom; and thus the truth of\nwhat report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken, and with\nher envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being\ncruel, somewhat haughty, and very scornful.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper\nof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous\nvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their\neyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave\nthere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty\nexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed\nupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see her\nwere not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But the\ninstant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest indignation:\n\n\"Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if\nin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being\nthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of\nthy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look\ndown from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in thy\narrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter\ntrampled on her father Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for what thou art come,\nor what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the thoughts of\nChrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make all these who\ncall themselves his friends obey thee, though he be dead.\"\n\n\"I come not, Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named,\" replied\nMarcela, \"but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all\nthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and\ntherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for\nwill not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons\nof sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that\nin spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love\nyou show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that\nnatural understanding which God has given me I know that everything\nbeautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved,\nthat which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it;\nbesides, it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be\nugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, \"I love\nthee because thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.\" But\nsupposing the beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the\ninclinations must be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that\nexcites love, some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection;\nand if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart, the will\nwould wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as\nthere is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of\ninclinations, and true love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and\nmust be voluntary and not compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to\nbe, why do you desire me to bend my will by force, for no other reason\nbut that you say you love me? Nay--tell me--had Heaven made me ugly, as it\nhas made me beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not\nloving me? Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no\nchoice of mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me\nwithout my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with\nit, does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a\ngift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for\nbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the\none does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come too\nnear. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without which the\nbody, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty\nis one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and\nbody, why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify\none who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to\nrob her of it? I was born free, and that I might live in freedom I chose\nthe solitude of the fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society,\nthe clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and\nwaters I make known my thoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword\nlaid aside. Those whom I have inspired with love by letting them see me,\nI have by words undeceived, and if their longings live on hope--and I\nhave given none to Chrysostom or to any other--it cannot justly be said\nthat the death of any is my doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy\nthan my cruelty that killed him; and if it be made a charge against me\nthat his wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield\nto them, I answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made\nhe declared to me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live\nin perpetual solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits\nof my retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open\navowal, he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what\nwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I\nhad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should\nhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was\npersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink\nyou now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my\ncharge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way to\ndespair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter himself\nwhom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but let not him\ncall me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise\nno deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has not been so far\nthe will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to expect me to love\nby choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve for each of my\nsuitors on his own account, and let it be understood from this time forth\nthat if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he dies, for\nshe who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any, and candour\nis not to be confounded with scorn. Let him who calls me wild beast and\nbasilisk, leave me alone as something noxious and evil; let him who calls\nme ungrateful, withhold his service; who calls me wayward, seek not my\nacquaintance; who calls me cruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast,\nthis basilisk, this ungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of\ndesire to seek, serve, know, or follow them. If Chrysostom's impatience\nand violent passion killed him, why should my modest behaviour and\ncircumspection be blamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the\ntrees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob\nme of it? I have, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of\nothers; my taste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I\nneither love nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or\ntrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the shepherd\ngirls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations; my\ndesires are bounded by these mountains, and if they ever wander hence it\nis to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps by which the soul\ntravels to its primeval abode.\"\n\nWith these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and passed\ninto the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who were\nthere lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty.\nSome--those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright\neyes--made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank\ndeclaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting\noccasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,\nDon Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a\nloud and distinct voice:\n\n\"Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautiful\nMarcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She has shown by\nclear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be found\nwith her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she is from\nyielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead of\nbeing followed and persecuted, she should in justice be honoured and\nesteemed by all the good people of the world, for she shows that she is\nthe only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution.\"\n\nWhether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosio\ntold them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the\nshepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave\nand burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his body in it, not without\nmany tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave with a heavy\nstone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to have\nprepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:\n\nBeneath the stone before your eyes\nThe body of a lover lies;\nIn life he was a shepherd swain,\nIn death a victim to disdain.\nUngrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,\nWas she that drove him to despair,\nAnd Love hath made her his ally\nFor spreading wide his tyranny.\n\nThey then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches, and\nall expressing their condolence with his friend ambrosio, took their\nVivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote bade farewell to\nhis hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to come with them to\nSeville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for\nthey presented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener\nthan anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for the\ndisposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the present\nhe would not, and must not go to Seville until he had cleared all these\nmountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report said they were full.\nSeeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him\nfurther, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued\ntheir journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the\nstory of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote.\nHe, on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and\nmake offer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did\nnot fall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in the\ncourse of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN\nWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS\n\n\nThe sage Cide Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took\nleave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of\nChrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had\nseen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more\nthan two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,\nthey came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which\nran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there\nthe hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come\non oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante\nand the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they\nransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and\nsociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.\n\nSancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure,\nfrom what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that\nall the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an\nimpropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so\nordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician\nponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take\ntheir midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and\nwater abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the\nYanguesans' purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante took\na fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and\nabandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without\nasking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened to\nmake known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their\npasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to such\neffect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a\nsaddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that the\ncarriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came\nrunning up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought him\nsorely battered to the ground.\n\nBy this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of\nRocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:\n\n\"So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folk\nof low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking\ndue vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.\"\n\n\"What the devil vengeance can we take,\" answered Sancho, \"if they are\nmore than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more\nthan one and a half?\"\n\n\"I count for a hundred,\" replied Don Quixote, and without more words he\ndrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by\nthe example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don\nQuixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather\njerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The\nYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were\nso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the\nmiddle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the\nsecond blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the\nsame way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate\nwilled it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet\nrisen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry\nboorish hands.\n\nThen, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the\nhaste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the\ntwo adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.\n\nSancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master\nhe called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \"Senor Don Quixote, ah,\nSenor Don Quixote!\"\n\n\"What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\" answered Don Quixote in the same\nfeeble suffering tone as Sancho.\n\n\"I would like, if it were possible,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"your worship\nto give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be\nthat you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones\nas well as for wounds.\"\n\n\"If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\" said\nDon Quixote; \"but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a\nknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I\nmean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\"\n\n\"But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our\nfeet?\" answered Sancho Panza.\n\n\"For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\" said the battered knight\nDon Quixote; \"but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business\nto put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like\nmyself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the\nlaws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be\nadministered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou\nshouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to\nthee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. It is at\nwhen thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not\nto wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but\ndo thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart's content, and if any\nknights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and\nassail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand\nsigns and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal\nto\"--so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over\nthe stout Biscayan.\n\nBut Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as to let\nit pass without saying in reply, \"Senor, I am a man of peace, meek and\nquiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and\nchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your\nworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw sword\neither against clown or against knight, and that here before God I\nforgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have been,\nare, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or\ncommoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.\"\n\nTo all which his master said in reply, \"I wish I had breath enough to\nspeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate\nso as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come\nnow, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should\nturn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and\nwithout impediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have\npromised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee\nlord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being\na knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor\nthe will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know\nthat in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the\ninhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that\nthere is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more,\nand try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential\nthat the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern,\nand valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him.\"\n\n\"In what has now befallen us,\" answered Sancho, \"I'd have been well\npleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,\nbut I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than\nfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante,\nthough he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this\nthrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a\nvirtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it\ntakes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure\nin this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your\nworship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling\npost and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has\nfallen upon our shoulders?\"\n\n\"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought to be used to such\nsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they\nmust feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I\nimagine--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these\nannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I\nwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\"\n\nTo this the squire replied, \"Senor, as these mishaps are what one reaps\nof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their own\nfixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after two\nharvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinite\nmercy helps us.\"\n\n\"Know, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of\nknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither\nmore nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to\nbecome kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many\ndifferent knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I\ncould tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by\nmight of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those\nsame, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries;\nfor the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal\nenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him\ncaptive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his\nhorse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is\na certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight\nof Phoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his\nfeet in a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in\na deep pit underground, where they administered to him one of those\nthings they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh\nfinished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by\na sage, a great friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor\nknight; so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk, for\ngreater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we\nsuffer. For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any\ninstruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity,\nand this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if, for\ninstance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his\nhand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that\nreason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest\nthou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we\nhave therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried,\nwith which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not\none of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\"\n\n\"They gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly had\nI laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with\ntheir sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and\nthe strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where\nthinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not\ngives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will\nremain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\"\n\n\"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\nthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain\nwhich death does not remove.\"\n\n\"And what greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the one\nthat waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our\nmishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it\nwould not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in\na hospital almost won't be enough to put us right.\"\n\n\"No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to\ndo,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems\nto me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of\nthe poor beast.\"\n\n\"There is nothing wonderful in that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a\nknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off\nscot-free where we come out scotched.\"\n\n\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief\nto it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so because this little beast may now\nsupply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I\nmay be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour\nto be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus,\nthe tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the\ncity of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome\nass.\"\n\n\"It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered\nSancho, \"but there is a great difference between going mounted and going\nslung like a sack of manure.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Wounds received in battle confer honour\ninstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I\ntold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy\nbeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere\nnight come on and surprise us in these wilds.\"\n\n\"And yet I have heard your worship say,\" observed Panza, \"that it is very\nmeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they\nesteem it very good fortune.\"\n\n\"That is,\" said Don Quixote, \"when they cannot help it, or when they are\nin love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have\nremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the\ninclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and\none of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took up\nhis abode on the Pena Pobre for--I know not if it was eight years or\neight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he\nstayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana\nhad against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a\nmishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass.\"\n\n\"The very devil would be in it in that case,\" said Sancho; and letting\noff thirty \"ohs,\" and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions\nand execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he\nraised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power\nto bring himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who\ntoo had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the\nday; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a\ntongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master\nwould have been behind him.\n\nTo be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante\nwith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more\nor less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might\nbe; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to\nbetter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and\non it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of\nDon Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn,\nand his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted\nso long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and\ninto it Sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN IN THE INN WHICH HE TOOK TO\nBE A CASTLE\n\n\nThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what\nwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had\nfallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper\nhad a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling\ncommonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the\nsufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don\nQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in\ntaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an\nAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one\neye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be\nsure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from\nhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made\nher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass, then,\nhelped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote\nin a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many\nyears as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose\nbed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made\nof the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the advantage of\nit, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not\nvery even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a\nquilt, full of pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be\nwool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made\nof buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose\nmight have counted without missing one in the reckoning.\n\nOn this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and\nher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while\nMaritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the light for\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of wheals\nDon Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the look of\nblows than of a fall.\n\nIt was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and\nprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. \"Pray, senora,\" he\nadded, \"manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to\nuse it, for my loins too are rather sore.\"\n\n\"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess.\n\n\"I did not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at seeing\nmy master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand\nthwacks.\"\n\n\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time happened\nto me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to\nthe ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and\nshaken as if I had really fallen.\"\n\n\"There is the point, senora,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"that I without\ndreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with\nscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"How is the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian.\n\n\"Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a\nknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen\nin the world this long time past.\"\n\n\"What is a knight-adventurer?\" said the lass.\n\n\"Are you so new in the world as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza.\n\"Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing\nthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or\nthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\"\n\n\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master\nas this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a\ncounty?\"\n\n\"It is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month\ngoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that\ncan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for\nanother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of\nthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not\nchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.\"\n\nTo all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and\nsitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand\nhe said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate\nin having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that\nif I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said,\nthat self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only\ntell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the\nservice you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while\nlife shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled\nand subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name\nbetween my teeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the\nmasters of my liberty.\"\n\nThe hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in\nbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about\nas much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they could\nperceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and\nblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they\nstared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man of\na different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in\npothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave\nher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.\n\nThe carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,\nand she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the\nfamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes\nunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made\npromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them\nin a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself\ngreatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an\nemployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and\nill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,\nrickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit\nstable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of a\nrush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas\nrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made\nup, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the\ntwo best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump,\nand in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo,\naccording to the author of this history, who particularly mentions this\ncarrier because he knew him very well, and they even say was in some\ndegree a relation of his; besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a\nhistorian of great research and accuracy in all things, as is very\nevident since he would not pass over in silence those that have been\nalready mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an\nexample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate\ntransactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them,\nall the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from\ncarelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on the\nauthor of \"Tablante de Ricamonte\" and that of the other book in which the\ndeeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they\ndescribe everything!\n\nTo proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them\ntheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and\nlay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this time\nplastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of\nhis ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of his had\nhis eyes as wide open as a hare's.\n\nThe inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light\nexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the\ngateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our\nknight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that\nwere the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as\nextraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he\nfancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said,\nall the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the\ndaughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and\nthat she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and\nhad promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the\nknowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had\nconstructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the\nperilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in\nhis heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even\nthough the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanona should present\nthemselves before him.\n\nWhile he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the\nhour--an unlucky one for him--arrived for the Asturian to come, who in\nher smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with\nnoiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were\nquartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door\nwhen Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of his\nplasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receive\nhis beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in\nsilence with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the\narms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing\nher towards him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on\nthe bed. He then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it\nappeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she\nwore some glass beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient\npearls: her hair, which in some measure resembled a horse's mane, he\nrated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed\nthe sun himself: her breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale\nsalad, seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her\nmouth; and, in short, he drew her portrait in his imagination with the\nsame features and in the same style as that which he had seen in his\nbooks of the other princesses who, smitten by love, came with all the\nadornments that are here set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and\nso great was the poor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor\nsmell, nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any but\na carrier vomit, were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was\npersuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her\nfirmly in his grasp he went on to say in low, tender voice:\n\n\"Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to repay\nsuch a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, have\ngranted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good,\nhas chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken\nthat though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is\nimpossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet greater is to be\nadded, which is the faith that I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea\ndel Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and were it not that\nthis stood in the way I should not be so insensible a knight as to miss\nthe happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me.\"\n\nMaritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by\nDon Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to\nher, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,\nwhose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment\nshe entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote\nsaid; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him\nfor another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to see what\nwould come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he\nperceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to\nhold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a\nterrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all\nhis mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and\nwith his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot.\nThe bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to\nsupport the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at\nthe mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that\nit must be some brawl of Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her\nhe got no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp\nhastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench,\nseeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was\nterrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza,\nwho still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself.\n\nThe innkeeper came in exclaiming, \"Where art thou, strumpet? Of course\nthis is some of thy work.\" At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass\nalmost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute\nfisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who,\nirritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in\nreturn to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then,\nfinding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as\nwell as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them\nbegan the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier,\nhowever, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared\nwith his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she\nneeded; and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention,\nfor his was to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she\nalone was the cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to\nrat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the\nlass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that\nthey did not give themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that\nthe innkeeper's lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all\nlaid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a\nsound spot left where a hand could light.\n\nIt so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero\nof what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing\nthe extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin\ncase with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room\ncrying: \"Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the\nHoly Brotherhood!\"\n\nThe first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay\nstretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand\nfalling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, \"Help for the\nJurisdiction!\" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did not\nmove or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room\nwere his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice still\nhigher, calling out, \"Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; they\nhave killed a man here!\" This cry startled them all, and each dropped the\ncontest at the point at which the voice reached him. The innkeeper\nretreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her\ncrib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from\nwhere they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote's beard, and\nwent out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits;\nbut not finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the\nlantern on retreating to his room, he was compelled to have recourse to\nthe hearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nIN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON\nQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HIS\nMISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE\n\nBy this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same\ntone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when he\nlay stretched \"in the vale of the stakes,\" he began calling to him now,\n\"Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?\"\n\n\"How can I sleep, curses on it!\" returned Sancho discontentedly and\nbitterly, \"when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this\nnight?\"\n\n\"Thou mayest well believe that,\" answered Don Quixote, \"because, either I\nknow little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know-but this\nthat I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until\nafter my death.\"\n\n\"I swear it,\" answered Sancho.\n\n\"I say so,\" continued Don Quixote, \"because I hate taking away anyone's\ngood name.\"\n\n\"I say,\" replied Sancho, \"that I swear to hold my tongue about it till\nthe end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it out\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou\nwouldst see me dead so soon?\"\n\n\"It is not for that,\" replied Sancho, \"but because I hate keeping things\nlong, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Don Quixote, \"I have more confidence in thy affection\nand good nature; and so I would have thee know that this night there\nbefell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe, and to\nrelate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the\ndaughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the most\nelegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world. What\nI could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her lively wit! of\nother secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I will\nonly tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed\nin my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this\ncastle being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was\nengaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came,\nwithout my seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm\nof some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them\nall bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a\nworse plight than yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante's\nmisbehaviour, inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence\nconjecture that there must be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure\nof this damsel's beauty, and that it is not for me.\"\n\n\"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than four hundred Moors have\nso thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread\nto it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare\nadventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your worship was\nnot so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke\nof; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I had in\nall my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a\nknight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the\ngreater part falls to my share.\"\n\n\"Then thou hast been thrashed too?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Be not distressed, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will now make the\nprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of an\neye.\"\n\nBy this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came\nin to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho caught\nsight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a cloth on\nhis head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he\nsaid to his master, \"Senor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moor\ncoming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left\nin the ink-bottle?\"\n\n\"It cannot be the Moor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for those under\nenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.\"\n\n\"If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\" said\nSancho; \"if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.\"\n\n\"Mine could speak too,\" said Don Quixote, \"but that is not a sufficient\nreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.\"\n\nThe officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful\nconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay on\nhis back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The officer\nturned to him and said, \"Well, how goes it, good man?\"\n\n\"I would speak more politely if I were you,\" replied Don Quixote; \"is it\nthe way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you\nbooby?\"\n\nThe cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\nsorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of\noil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a\nbadly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho\nPanza said, \"That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and he keeps\nthe treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in\ntroubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\nvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\none on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\ncanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\nlittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for\nindeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much\nblood from the wound that phantom gave me.\"\n\nSancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper\nin the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had\nbecome of his enemy, he said to him, \"Senor, whoever you are, do us the\nfavour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine,\nfor it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who\nlies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in\nthis inn.\"\n\nWhen the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out of\nhis senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\ngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\nhost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\nQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\nblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\nof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that\nflowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be brief, he\ntook the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them all and\nboiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to\nperfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was\nnot one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or\nflask of which the host made him a free gift; and over the flask he\nrepeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave-marias,\nsalves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by way of\nbenediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and\nthe cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending\nto the comfort of his mules.\n\nThis being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\nspot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and so\nhe drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he\ndone drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left\nin his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a\nprofuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave\nhim alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the\nend of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease\nfrom his bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed\nhe had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he\nmight thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction,\nbattle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\n\nSancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\nmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\nwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with both\nhands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off\nvery little less than his master. But the fact is, that the stomach of\npoor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and\nso, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and\nsuch sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he believed his last\nhour had come, and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the\nbalsam and the thief that had given it to him.\n\nDon Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho, that\nthis mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded\nthis liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\"\n\n\"If your worship knew that,\" returned Sancho--\"woe betide me and all my\nkindred!--why did you let me taste it?\"\n\nAt this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\ndischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\nthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\nconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had\ncome. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of\nwhich he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he\ncould not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt\nhimself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in\nquest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered\nthere was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his\nhelp and protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence\nhis balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled\nRocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom\nlikewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his\nhorse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that\nstood there, to serve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn,\nwho were more than twenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper's\ndaughter was likewise observing him, and he too never took his eyes off\nher, and from time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from\nthe depths of his bowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain\nhe felt in his ribs; at any rate they who had seen him plastered the\nnight before thought so.\n\nAs soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\nthe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, \"Many and great are\nthe favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours,\nand I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them\nall the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of any\narrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no other\nthan to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise\nperfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you\nneed only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood\nwhich I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the\nutmost of your desire.\"\n\nThe innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not\nwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me\nI can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is that\nyou pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well\nfor the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.\"\n\n\"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"And a very respectable one,\" said the innkeeper.\n\n\"I have been under a mistake all this time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for\nin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it\nappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\nthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\nknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have\nread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or\nanything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that\nmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the\ninsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day,\nin summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst,\ncold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the\nhardships of earth.\"\n\n\"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me what you\nowe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about is\nto get my money.\"\n\n\"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don Quixote, and putting spurs\nto Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn\nbefore anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking\nto see if his squire was following him.\n\nThe innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of\nSancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,\nbecause, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and\nreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying\nanything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth,\nand threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he would not\nlike. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his master\nhad received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his life; for the\nexcellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going to be\nviolated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into\nthe world ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a\nprivilege.\n\nThe ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the\ncompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three\nneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair of\nSeville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful,\nwho, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to\nSancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them went in for the\nblanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up,\nand seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower than what they required for\ntheir work, they decided upon going out into the yard, which was bounded\nby the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they\nbegan to raise him high, making sport with him as they would with a dog\nat Shrovetide.\n\nThe cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the\nears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded\nthat some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it\nwas his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn\nwith a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went round it to see if he\ncould find some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the wall of\nthe yard, which was not very high, he discovered the game that was being\nplayed with his squire. He saw him rising and falling in the air with\nsuch grace and nimbleness that, had his rage allowed him, it is my belief\nhe would have laughed. He tried to climb from his horse on to the top of\nthe wall, but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even\ndismount; and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such\nmaledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as\nit would be impossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not\nstay their laughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho\ncease his lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but\nall to little purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they\nleft off. They then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it\nthey put his jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing\nhim so exhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and\nthat it might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took\nit, and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of\nhis master exclaiming, \"Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my\nson, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and he\nheld up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt\ncertainly be restored.\"\n\nAt these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder\nvoice said, \"Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight,\nor do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left after\nlast night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me\nto myself!\" and at one and the same instant he left off talking and began\ndrinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did not\ncare to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him some wine,\nwhich she did with right good will, and paid for it with her own money;\nfor indeed they say of her that, though she was in that line of life,\nthere was some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her.\nWhen Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass, and the gate\nof the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having\npaid nothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of\nhis usual sureties, his shoulders. It is true that the innkeeper detained\nhis alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but Sancho took his\ndeparture in such a flurry that he never missed them. The innkeeper, as\nsoon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers\nwould not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two\nfarthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of the\nknights-errant of the Round Table.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER, DON\nQUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING\n\nSancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his\nbeast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, \"I have now come\nto the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt\nenchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with\nthee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and I\nhold this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the\nyard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to\nmount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no\ndoubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am\nthat if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged\nthee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered\ntheir freak for ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened\nthe laws of chivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a\nknight to lay hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and\ngreat necessity in defence of his own life and person.\"\n\n\"I would have avenged myself too if I could,\" said Sancho, \"whether I had\nbeen dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am\npersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or\nenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like\nourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when\nthey were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another\nTenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque\nthe Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leap over the\nwall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else\nbesides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that\nthese adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such\nmisadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that\nthe best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to\nreturn home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and\ngive over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the\nsaying is.\"\n\n\"How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote;\n\"hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see\nwith thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the\npursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be\nin the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and\ntriumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond all doubt.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" answered Sancho, \"though I do not know it; all I know is\nthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been\none (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number)\nwe have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even\nout of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the\nless; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more\ncudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and\nabove, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge\nmyself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it, of\nconquering an enemy is like.\"\n\n\"That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,\" replied Don\nQuixote; \"but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some sword\nmade by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him\nwho carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me\nthat which belonged to Amadis when he was called 'The Knight of the\nBurning Sword,' which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the\nworld possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a\nrazor, and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be,\nthat could resist it.\"\n\n\"Such is my luck,\" said Sancho, \"that even if that happened and your\nworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out\nserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,\nthey might sup sorrow.\"\n\n\"Fear not that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote: \"Heaven will deal better by\nthee.\"\n\nThus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the\nroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a large\nand thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and said:\n\n\"This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is\nreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any\nother shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do\ndeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come.\nSeest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all that is\nchurned up by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that\ncomes marching there.\"\n\n\"According to that there must be two,\" said Sancho, \"for on this opposite\nside also there rises just such another cloud of dust.\"\n\nDon Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing\nexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and\nencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons\nhis fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats,\nloves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, and\neverything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things. Now the\ncloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming\nalong the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust,\ndid not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote asserted so\npositively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it and\nsay, \"Well, and what are we to do, senor?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Don Quixote: \"give aid and assistance to the weak and those\nwho need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite\nto us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the\ngreat isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his\nenemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he\nalways goes into battle with his right arm bare.\"\n\n\"But why are these two lords such enemies?\"\n\n\"They are at enmity,\" replied Don Quixote, \"because this Alifanfaron is a\nfurious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a\nvery beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her\nfather is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first\nabandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.\"\n\n\"By my beard,\" said Sancho, \"but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will\nhelp him as much as I can.\"\n\n\"In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for\nto engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed\nknight.\"\n\n\"That I can well understand,\" answered Sancho; \"but where shall we put\nthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I\nbelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of\nthis kind.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and what you had best do with him is\nto leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses\nwe shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even\nRocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me\nand observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights\nwho accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and\nmark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both\narmies may be seen.\"\n\nThey did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two\ndroves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if\nthe clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the\nsight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and\nwhat did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:\n\n\"That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his\nshield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant\nLaurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of\ngold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is\nthe dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic\nframe, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de\nBoliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent\nskin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one of\nthose of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his death\nhe revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn thine eyes to the other\nside, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the\never victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New\nBiscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and\nyellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto\nwhich says Miau, which is the beginning of the name of his lady, who\naccording to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke\nAlfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins\nof that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank\nand without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres\nPapin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with\niron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra,\nand for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia,\nEspartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an\nasparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, Rastrea mi suerte.\"\nAnd so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other\nout of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms,\ncolours, devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his\nunheard-of craze; and without a pause, he continued, \"People of divers\nnations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the\nsweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian\nplains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that\nenjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many\nand various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the\nNumidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery,\nthe Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever\nshift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the\nEthiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose\nfeatures I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In\nthis other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of\nthe olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances with\nthe water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in the\nfertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian\nplains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the\nElysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of\ncorn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that\nbathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed\ntheir herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed\nfor its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad\nPyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many\nas all Europe includes and contains.\"\n\nGood God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to each\nits proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturated\nwith what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung upon his\nwords without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could\nsee the knights and giants his master was describing, and as he could not\nmake out one of them he said to him:\n\n\"Senor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight or\ngiant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the phantoms\nlast night.\"\n\n\"How canst thou say that!\" answered Don Quixote; \"dost thou not hear the\nneighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of the\ndrums?\"\n\n\"I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,\" said Sancho;\nwhich was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.\n\n\"The fear thou art in, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"prevents thee from\nseeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derange\nthe senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou\nart in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone\nI suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give my aid;\"\nand so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest,\nshot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted after him, crying,\n\"Come back, Senor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you\nare charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that begot me! what madness\nis this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor\nshields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. What are you\nabout? Sinner that I am before God!\" But not for all these entreaties did\nDon Quixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, \"Ho,\nknights, ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperor\nPentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily I\nshall give him his revenge over his enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.\"\n\nSo saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began\nspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were\ntransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers\naccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,\nthey ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as big\nas one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting drive\nright and left kept saying:\n\n\"Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knight\nwho would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy\nlife a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin\nGaramanta.\" Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on the\nside and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling himself so smitten,\nhe imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and recollecting\nhis liquor he drew out his flask, and putting it to his mouth began to\npour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in\nswallowing what seemed to him enough, there came another almond which\nstruck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to\npieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its\ncourse, and sorely crushing two fingers of his hand. Such was the force\nof the first blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of\nhimself came down backwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and\nfelt sure they had killed him; so in all haste they collected their flock\ntogether, took up the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven,\nand made off without waiting to ascertain anything further.\n\nAll this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his\nmaster was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and the\noccasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him, then,\nbrought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off,\nhe ran to him and found him in very bad case, though not unconscious; and\nsaid he:\n\n\"Did I not tell you to come back, Senor Don Quixote; and that what you\nwere going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?\"\n\n\"That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify\nthings,\" answered Don Quixote; \"thou must know, Sancho, that it is a very\neasy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose;\nand this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew\nI was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into\ndroves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho, to\nundeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and\nfollow them quietly, and thou shalt see that when they have gone some\nlittle distance from this they will return to their original shape and,\nceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as I described them to\nthee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thy help and assistance;\ncome hither, and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I\nfeel as if there was not one left in my mouth.\"\n\nSancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now just\nat that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, at\nthe very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he discharged all\nits contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of\nthe compassionate squire.\n\n\"Holy Mary!\" cried Sancho, \"what is this that has happened me? Clearly\nthis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;\" but\nconsidering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour,\ntaste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask\nwhich he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a loathing that\nhis stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very master,\nand both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his ass to get\nsomething wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his\nalforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses,\nand cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and\nreturn home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all\nhopes of the promised island.\n\nDon Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his\nteeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of the\nbridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's side--so\nloyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where the squire\nstood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in deep\ndejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said to\nhim:\n\n\"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he\ndoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs\nthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\nus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it\nfollows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at\nhand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen\nto me, since thou hast no share in them.\"\n\n\"How have I not?\" replied Sancho; \"was he whom they blanketed yesterday\nperchance any other than my father's son? and the alforjas that are\nmissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but\nmyself?\"\n\n\"What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Yes, they are missing,\" answered Sancho.\n\n\"In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,\" replied Don Quixote.\n\n\"It would be so,\" answered Sancho, \"if there were none of the herbs your\nworship says you know in these meadows, those with which knights-errant\nas unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like shortcomings.\"\n\n\"For all that,\" answered Don Quixote, \"I would rather have just now a\nquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than all\nthe herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.\nNevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,\nfor God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially\nwhen we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the\nmidges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the\nwater, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good and\non the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.\"\n\n\"Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,\" said\nSancho.\n\n\"Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"for there were knights-errant in former times as well qualified\nto deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment, as if\nthey had graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that\nthe lance has never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.\"\n\n\"Well, be it as your worship says,\" replied Sancho; \"let us be off now\nand find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be\nsomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, nor\nenchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern.\"\n\n\"Ask that of God, my son,\" said Don Quixote; \"and do thou lead on where\nthou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach me\nhere thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my\nteeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw, for\nit is there I feel the pain.\"\n\nSancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, \"How many\ngrinders used your worship have on this side?\"\n\n\"Four,\" replied Don Quixote, \"besides the back-tooth, all whole and quite\nsound.\"\n\n\"Mind what you are saying, senor.\"\n\n\"I say four, if not five,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for never in my life\nhave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been\ndestroyed by any decay or rheum.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Sancho, \"in this lower side your worship has no more\nthan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any at\nall, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.\"\n\n\"Luckless that I am!\" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire\ngave him; \"I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the\nsword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a mill\nwithout a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a\ndiamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to\nall this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at\nwhatever pace thou wilt.\"\n\nSancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he\nthought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was\nthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow pace--for\nthe pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for\nspeed--Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some\nkind, and among the things he said to him was that which will be told in\nthe following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nOF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THE\nADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLE\nOCCURRENCES\n\n\"It seems to me, senor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of\nlate have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed\nby your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath you\nmade not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all the\nrest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken that\nhelmet of Malandrino's, or whatever the Moor is called, for I do not very\nwell remember.\"\n\n\"Thou art very right, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but to tell the truth,\nit had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the\naffair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not\nreminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of\ncompounding for everything in the order of chivalry.\"\n\n\"Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,\" said Don Quixote;\n\"suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and\nwhether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a\nremedy.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho, \"mind that your worship does not forget this\nas you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads to\namuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship if they see\nyou so obstinate.\"\n\nWhile engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road\nbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made\nit still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of\nthe alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to\ncomplete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any\ninvention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the night\nclosed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho\nfeeling sure that as the road was the king's highway they might\nreasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two. Going along,\nthen, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master\nsharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling\na great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion.\nSancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did Don Quixote\naltogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the\nother his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to\nsee what all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were\napproaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they seemed, at\nwhich spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury, and\nDon Quixote's hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit a\nlittle, said:\n\n\"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in\nwhich it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and\nresolution.\"\n\n\"Unlucky me!\" answered Sancho; \"if this adventure happens to be one of\nphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs\nto bear it?\"\n\n\"Be they phantoms ever so much,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will not permit\nthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with\nthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of\nthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield\nmy sword as I please.\"\n\n\"And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,\" said\nSancho, \"what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?\"\n\n\"For all that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a\ngood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.\"\n\n\"I will, please God,\" answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side\nof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving\nlights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty\nencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\nawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of\nSancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of\nan ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they\nperceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over\nwith black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to\nthe very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainly they were\nnot horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the encamisados\ncame along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This\nstrange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite\nenough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even into his master's;\nand (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for all Sancho's resolution had\nnow broken down. It was just the opposite with his master, whose\nimagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the\nadventures of his books.\n\nHe took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\nsome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\nfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\nrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\nbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\nencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\nhand he raised his voice and said:\n\n\"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\nare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\nfor, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\nwrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should\nknow, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else\nthat I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.\"\n\n\"We are in haste,\" answered one of the encamisados, \"and the inn is far\noff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\" and\nspurring his mule he moved on.\n\nDon Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by\nthe bridle he said, \"Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of\nwhat I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.\"\n\nThe mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\nrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\nattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse Don\nQuixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance\nin rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded\nto the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with\nwhich he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just\nas if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly\ndid he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so\nthey speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across\nthe plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers\nrunning on some gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and\nswathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and\nso with entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and\ndrove them off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but\na devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the\nlitter.\n\nSancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,\nand said to himself, \"Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant\nas he says he is.\"\n\nA burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had\nthrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up to\nhim he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him to\nyield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrate\nman replied, \"I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of my\nlegs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not to\nkill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiate\nand I hold first orders.\"\n\n\"Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"What, senor?\" said the other. \"My bad luck.\"\n\n\"Then still worse awaits you,\" said Don Quixote, \"if you do not satisfy\nme as to all I asked you at first.\"\n\n\"You shall be soon satisfied,\" said the licentiate; \"you must know, then,\nthat though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a bachelor, and\nmy name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from the\ncity of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the\ntorches, and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body\nwhich is in that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza,\nwhere he was interred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to\ntheir burial-place, which is in Segovia, where he was born.\"\n\n\"And who killed him?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,\" answered the\nbachelor.\n\n\"In that case,\" said Don Quixote, \"the Lord has relieved me of the task\nof avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him\nhaving slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug\none's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would\nhave your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by\nname, and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs\nand redressing injuries.\"\n\n\"I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,\" said the bachelor,\n\"for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken leg\nthat will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; and\nthe injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured in\nsuch a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height of\nmisadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.\"\n\n\"Things do not all happen in the same way,\" answered Don Quixote; \"it all\ncame, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by night,\ndressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered with\nmourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of the\nother world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, and\nI should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were the\nvery devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.\"\n\n\"As my fate has so willed it,\" said the bachelor, \"I entreat you, sir\nknight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help me\nto get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between the\nstirrup and the saddle.\"\n\n\"I would have talked on till to-morrow,\" said Don Quixote; \"how long were\nyou going to wait before telling me of your distress?\"\n\nHe at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he was\njust then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender,\nwhich these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho made a bag of\nhis coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would\nhold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master's call,\nand helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting\nhim on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow\nthe track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the\nwrong which he could not help doing them.\n\nAnd said Sancho, \"If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who\nwas the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is\nthe famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the\nRueful Countenance.\"\n\nThe bachelor then took his departure.\n\nI forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,\n\"Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on\na holy thing, juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo.\"\n\n\"I do not understand that Latin,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but I know well\nI did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I was\ncommitting an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like a\nCatholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but upon\nphantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how it\nfared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that\nking before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him for the same;\nand yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very\nnoble and valiant knight.\"\n\nOn hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,\nwithout making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced\nhim to call him the \"Knight of the Rueful Countenance\" more then than at\nany other time.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho; \"it was because I have been looking\nat you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate,\nand verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance\nI ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or\nelse to the want of teeth and grinders.\"\n\n\"It is not that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but because the sage whose duty\nit will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it\nproper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore\ndid; one being 'He of the Burning Sword,' another 'He of the Unicorn,'\nthis one 'He of the Damsels,' that 'He of the Phoenix,' another 'The\nKnight of the Griffin,' and another 'He of the Death,' and by these names\nand designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that\nthe sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to\ncall me 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,' as I intend to call\nmyself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I\nmean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance\npainted on my shield.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making that\ncountenance,\" said Sancho; \"for all that need be done is for your worship\nto show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without\nanything more, either image or shield, they will call you 'Him of the\nRueful Countenance' and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I\nassure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of\nyour grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say,\nthe rueful picture may be very well spared.\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to\ncall himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he\nhad devised.\n\nDon Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter were\nbones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:\n\n\"Senor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself\nthan any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and\nrouted, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten\nthem, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in\nsearch of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the\nmountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do\nbut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave\nand the living to the loaf.\"\n\nAnd driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,\nfeeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after\nproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves\nin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded\nhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,\nthey breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying\ntheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead\nman's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)\nhad brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\nill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was\nthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and\nas thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they\nwere was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the\nfollowing chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nOF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THE\nVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVED\nBY ANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD\n\n\"It cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be\nhard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well to\nmove a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quench\nthis terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more\ndistressing than hunger.\"\n\nThe advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the\nbridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon\nhim the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their\nway, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;\nbut they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if\nfalling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them\ngreatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came\nthey heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the\nsound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by nature\ntimid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with a\nmeasured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together\nwith the furious din of the water, would have struck terror into any\nheart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said, dark, and they\nhad happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves\nstirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with\nthe solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the\nrustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more\nespecially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind\nlull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance\nas to where they were.\n\nBut Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,\nand bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and\nsaid, \"Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born in this\nour iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it\nis called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant\ndeeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights of\nthe Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who\nis to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and\nTirantes, the Phoebuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of famous\nknights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live such\nexploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest\ndeeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the gloom of this\nnight, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, the\nawful sound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as though\nit were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of\nthe Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears;\nwhich things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear,\ndread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, much more into one not\nused to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, then, all this that I\nput before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my\nheart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure,\narduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante's girths a\nlittle, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more,\nand if in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village,\nand thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso,\nwhere thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive\nknight hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being\ncalled hers.\"\n\nWhen Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most\npathetic way, saying:\n\n\"Senor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful\nadventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn about\nand take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for three days\nto come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be\nanyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time heard the\ncurate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he who\nseeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so\ntremendous a feat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle,\nand Heaven has performed enough of them for your worship in delivering\nyou from being blanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and\nsafe and sound from among all those enemies that were with the dead man;\nand if all this does not move or soften that hard heart, let this thought\nand reflection move it, that you will have hardly quitted this spot when\nfrom pure fear I shall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it. I\nleft home and wife and children to come and serve your worship, trusting\nto do better and not worse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it has\nrent my hopes asunder, for just as I had them highest about getting that\nwretched unlucky island your worship has so often promised me, I see that\ninstead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far\nfrom human reach: for God's sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by\nme, and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting this feat,\nat least put it off till morning, for by what the lore I learned when I\nwas a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because\nthe mouth of the Horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the\nleft arm.\"\n\n\"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it makes that\nline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when\nthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\nheaven?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things\nunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason to\nshow that it now wants but little of day.\"\n\n\"Let it want what it may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said of\nme now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing\nwhat was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho,\nto hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake now\nthis so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over\nmy safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten\nRocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly,\nalive or dead.\"\n\nSancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his\ntears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have\nrecourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till\ndaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly\nand without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both Rocinante's legs,\nso that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could\nonly move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza said:\n\n\"See there, senor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered\nit that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and\nstrike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against\nthe pricks.\"\n\nDon Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into\nthe horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of the\ntying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until\nRocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something\nother than Sancho's ingenuity. So he said to him, \"As it is so, Sancho,\nand as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn smiles upon\nus, even though I weep while it delays its coming.\"\n\n\"There is no need to weep,\" answered Sancho, \"for I will amuse your\nworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you\nlike to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after\nthe fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the\nmoment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are\nlooking forward to.\"\n\n\"What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?\" said Don\nQuixote. \"Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their rest\nin the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as\nthou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my character.\"\n\n\"Be not angry, master mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say\nthat;\" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the\nsaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's left\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;\nso much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular\nbeat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had\nproposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he\nheard would let him; \"Still,\" said he, \"I will strive to tell a story\nwhich, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with the\ntelling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your\nattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is to\ncome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it--your\nworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their\ntales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino\nthe Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for it,' and it\ncomes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your\nworship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter, and\nthat we should go back by some other road, since nobody forces us to\nfollow this in which so many terrors affright us.\"\n\n\"Go on with thy story, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and leave the choice\nof our road to my care.\"\n\n\"I say then,\" continued Sancho, \"that in a village of Estremadura there\nwas a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherd\nor goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz\nwas in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess called\nTorralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-\"\n\n\"If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these two\ndays; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else\nsay nothing.\"\n\n\"Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,\"\nanswered Sancho, \"and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of\nyour worship to ask me to make new customs.\"\n\n\"Tell it as thou wilt,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and as fate will have it\nthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.\"\n\n\"And so, lord of my soul,\" continued Sancho, as I have said, this\nshepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom\nlass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had little\nmoustaches; I fancy I see her now.\"\n\n\"Then you knew her?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I did not know her,\" said Sancho, \"but he who told me the story said it\nwas so true and certain that when I told it to another I might safely\ndeclare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, the\ndevil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived that\nthe love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and\nill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some little\njealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden\nground; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward\nthat, in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the country and\ngo where he should never set eyes on her again. Torralva, when she found\nherself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten with love for him,\nthough she had never loved him before.\"\n\n\"That is the natural way of women,\" said Don Quixote, \"to scorn the one\nthat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.\"\n\n\"It came to pass,\" said Sancho, \"that the shepherd carried out his\nintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the\nplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.\nTorralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot\nfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her hand and a\nscrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of\nlooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint\nfor her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to trouble\nmyself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say, came with\nhis flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that time\nswollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came to\nthere was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to\nthe other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived that\nTorralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with her\ntears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely that he\ndiscovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small that it\ncould only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he spoke to him\nand agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across.\nThe fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he came back\nand carried another over; he came back again, and again brought over\nanother--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking\nacross, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story,\nand it will be impossible to tell another word of it. To proceed, I must\ntell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and\nthe fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he\nreturned for another goat, and another, and another.\"\n\n\"Take it for granted he brought them all across,\" said Don Quixote, \"and\ndon't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of\nbringing them over this twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"How many have gone across so far?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"How the devil do I know?\" replied Don Quixote.\n\n\"There it is,\" said Sancho, \"what I told you, that you must keep a good\ncount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no\ngoing any farther.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" said Don Quixote; \"is it so essential to the story to\nknow to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be a\nmistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?\"\n\n\"No, senor, not a bit,\" replied Sancho; \"for when I asked your worship to\ntell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, at\nthat very instant all I had to say passed away out of my memory, and,\nfaith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\"\n\n\"So, then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the story has come to an end?\"\n\n\"As much as my mother has,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"In truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast told one of the rarest stories,\ntales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have imagined, and\nsuch a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a\nlifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy excellent\nunderstanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes\nmay have confused thy wits.\"\n\n\"All that may be,\" replied Sancho, \"but I know that as to my story, all\nthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of\nthe passage of the goats begins.\"\n\n\"Let it end where it will, well and good,\" said Don Quixote, \"and let us\nsee if Rocinante can go;\" and again he spurred him, and again Rocinante\nmade jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.\n\nJust then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now\napproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that\nit was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do what\nno one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated\nhis heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as\nthe black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was, however, also\nimpossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to remove his right hand,\nwhich held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently and\nsilently the running string which alone held up his breeches, so that on\nloosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then\nraised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slim\nones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to\nget out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater\ndifficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve\nhimself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed\nhis shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in\nspite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little\nnoise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.\n\nDon Quixote, hearing it, said, \"What noise is that, Sancho?\"\n\n\"I don't know, senor,\" said he; \"it must be something new, for adventures\nand misadventures never begin with a trifle.\" Once more he tried his\nluck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or\ndisturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so\nmuch discomfort. But as Don Quixote's sense of smell was as acute as his\nhearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose\nalmost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach his\nnose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it\nbetween his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, \"Sancho, it\nstrikes me thou art in great fear.\"\n\n\"I am,\" answered Sancho; \"but how does your worship perceive it now more\nthan ever?\"\n\n\"Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of\nambergris,\" answered Don Quixote.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Sancho, \"but that's not my fault, but your worship's,\nfor leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.\"\n\n\"Then go back three or four, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, all the time\nwith his fingers to his nose; \"and for the future pay more attention to\nthy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity\nwith thee that has bred this contempt.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" replied Sancho, \"that your worship thinks I have done\nsomething I ought not with my person.\"\n\n\"It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote.\n\nWith this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the\nnight, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very\ncautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as\nRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all\nmettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as to\ncapering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,\nthen, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a\nsignal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day had\nfully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that\nhe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he\nperceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but could\nnot discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he let\nRocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he told\nhim to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said before, and\nif he should not have returned by that time, he might feel sure it had\nbeen God's will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure.\nHe again repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on\nhis behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was not to be uneasy as to\nthe payment of his services, for before leaving home he had made his\nwill, in which he would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of\nwages in due proportion to the time he had served; but if God delivered\nhim safe, sound, and unhurt out of that danger, he might look upon the\npromised island as much more than certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on\nagain hearing the affecting words of his good master, and resolved to\nstay with him until the final issue and end of the business. From these\ntears and this honourable resolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this\nhistory infers that he must have been of good birth and at least an old\nChristian; and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to\nmake him show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well\nas he could, he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of\nthe water and of the strokes seemed to come.\n\nSancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,\nhis ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing\nsome distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little\nmeadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water\nflung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed\nhouses looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they\nperceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without\nintermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the\nblows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step by step towards the\nhouses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her\nsupport in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending\nhimself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho who never quitted his\nside, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs\nof Rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him\nsuch fear and apprehension. They went it might be a hundred paces\nfarther, when on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility\nof any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise\nthat had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared\nplain and obvious; and it was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and\ndisappointed) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made\nall the din.\n\nWhen Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid from\nhead to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down\nupon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced at\nSancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\nlaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\nvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when Sancho\nsaw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides\nwith both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. Four times\nhe stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the\nsame violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all\nwhen he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of\nHeaven's will I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden\nor age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty\nachievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on repeating the words\nthat Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes.\n\nDon Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was\nso mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such\nblows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught\nthem on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to\nhis heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest\nfor his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said\nto him very humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look\nhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\nhad been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being,\nas I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell\nwhether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as\nis the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as\nyou are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn me these six\nhammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one by one or all\ntogether, and if I do not knock them head over heels, then make what\nmockery you like of me.\"\n\n\"No more of that, senor,\" returned Sancho; \"I own I went a little too far\nwith the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made between\nus (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you\nas safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a\nthing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were\nin?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that you\nneither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.\"\n\n\"I do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be worth\nlaughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not\neveryone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right point\nwith your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks\nbe to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let that pass; all will\ncome out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'he loves thee well that\nmakes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the way with great lords after\nany hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; though\nI do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that\nknights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.\"\n\n\"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest will\ncome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our\nfirst movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future\nbear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company;\nfor in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they are\ninnumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as\nthou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine\nand of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine,\nthat I do not make myself more respected. There was Gandalin, the squire\nof Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him\nthat he always addressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head\nbowed down and his body bent double, more turquesco. And then, what shall\nwe say of Gasabal, the squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order\nto indicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is\nonly once mentioned in the whole of that history, as long as it is\ntruthful? From all I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must\nbe a difference between master and man, between lord and lackey, between\nknight and squire: so that from this day forward in our intercourse we\nmust observe more respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I\nmay be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and\nbenefits that I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do\nnot your wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.\"\n\n\"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \"but I should\nlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\nbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\nthe day like bricklayers?\"\n\n\"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that such squires were ever on\nwages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned thine in\nthe sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to what may\nhappen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in these\nwretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles\nin the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in this\nthere is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a\nfulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant\nadventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open my lips\nhenceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but only to\nhonour you as my master and natural lord.\"\n\n\"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long on the face of\nthe earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though\nthey were parents.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO'S\nHELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT\n\n\nIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling\nmills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of\nthe late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning\naside to right they came upon another road, different from that which\nthey had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived\na man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold,\nand the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:\n\n\"I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims\ndrawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially\nthat one that says, 'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I say so\nbecause if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were\nlooking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens\nwide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I\ndo not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it\nto my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say\nthis because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on\nhis head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou\nrememberest.\"\n\n\"Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\" said\nSancho, \"for I don't want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling\nand knocking our senses out.\"\n\n\"The devil take thee, man,\" said Don Quixote; \"what has a helmet to do\nwith fulling mills?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Sancho, \"but, faith, if I might speak as I used,\nperhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were\nmistaken in what you say.\"\n\n\"How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\" returned Don\nQuixote; \"tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a\ndappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\"\n\n\"What I see and make out,\" answered Sancho, \"is only a man on a grey ass\nlike my own, who has something that shines on his head.\"\n\n\"Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\" said Don Quixote; \"stand to one\nside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a\nword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess\nmyself of the helmet I have so longed for.\"\n\n\"I will take care to stand aside,\" said Sancho; \"but God grant, I say\nonce more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\"\n\n\"I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills\nto me again,\" said Don Quixote, \"or I vow--and I say no more-I'll full\nthe soul out of you.\"\n\nSancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow\nhe had hurled like a bowl at him.\n\nThe fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don\nQuixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one\nof them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop nor barber, which\nthe other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served\nthe smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and\nanother man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was\ngoing, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he\nwas on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably\nwas a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered\nat half a league's distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and\nthis was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a\nknight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with\nhis crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor\nknight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at\nRocinante's top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low,\nfully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him,\nwithout checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:\n\n\"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\nwhich is so reasonably my due.\"\n\nThe barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this\napparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself from\nthe stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no\nsooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a\ndeer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.\n\nHe left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\nhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the\nbeaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off\nwith its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is\npursued.\n\nHe told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:\n\n\"By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth\na maravedis,\" and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his\nhead, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and\nnot finding it he said, \"Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous\nhead-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the\nworst of it is half of it is wanting.\"\n\nWhen Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to\nrestrain his laughter, but remembering his master's wrath he checked\nhimself in the midst of it.\n\n\"What art thou laughing at, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I am laughing,\" said he, \"to think of the great head the pagan must have\nhad who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber's\nbasin.\"\n\n\"Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote; \"that this\nwonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident\nhave come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or\nrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be\nof the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what\nit might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber's\nbasin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its\ntransformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at the\nfirst village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that\nhelmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not\nsurpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as\nwell as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it\nwill be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.\"\n\n\"That is,\" said Sancho, \"if it is not shot with a sling as they were in\nthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your\nworship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that\nmade me vomit my bowels up.\"\n\n\"It does not grieve me much to have lost it,\" said Don Quixote, \"for thou\nknowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" answered Sancho, \"but if ever I make it, or try it again as\nlong as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention\nof putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five\nsenses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to\nbeing blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of\nthat sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our\nshoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go\nwhere luck and the blanket may send us.\"\n\n\"Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote on hearing this,\n\"for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know\nthat it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance\nto trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what\ncracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it\nwas, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would have\nreturned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for\nthe rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had\nlived then, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her\nbeauty as she is;\" and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said\nSancho, \"Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but\nI know what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be\nrubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that\naside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey\nsteed that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship\noverthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels\nand bolted, he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard\nbut the grey is a good one.\"\n\n\"I have never been in the habit,\" said Don Quixote, \"of taking spoil of\nthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away\ntheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the\nvictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to\ntake that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,\nSancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;\nfor when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.\"\n\n\"God knows I should like to take it,\" returned Sancho, \"or at least to\nchange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the\nlaws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one\nass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least\nchange trappings.\"\n\n\"On that head I am not quite certain,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and the\nmatter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest\nchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.\"\n\n\"So urgent is it,\" answered Sancho, \"that if they were for my own person\nI could not want them more;\" and forthwith, fortified by this licence, he\neffected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to the ninety-nines\nand making quite another thing of it. This done, they broke their fast on\nthe remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule, and\ndrank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a\nlook in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm\nthey had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and,\nwithout taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing\nfor true knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, which\ncarried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,\nwhich always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;\nnevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture\nwithout any other aim.\n\nAs they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, \"Senor,\nwould your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since you\nlaid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to\nrot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I\ndon't want to be spoiled.\"\n\n\"Say, on, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and be brief in thy discourse, for\nthere is no pleasure in one that is long.\"\n\n\"Well then, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"I say that for some days past I\nhave been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of\nthese adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads,\nwhere, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no\none to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to\nthe loss of your worship's object and the credit they deserve; therefore\nit seems to me it would be better (saving your worship's better judgment)\nif we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may\nhave some war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth\nof your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on\nperceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have\nto reward us, each according to his merits; and there you will not be at\na loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to\npreserve their memory for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not\ngo beyond squirely limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the\npractice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I think mine\nmust not be left out.\"\n\n\"Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but before that\npoint is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on\nprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and\nfame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of\nsome great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that\nthe boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all\nfollow him and surround him, crying, 'This is the Knight of the Sun'-or\nthe Serpent, or any other title under which he may have achieved great\ndeeds. 'This,' they will say, 'is he who vanquished in single combat the\ngigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great\nMameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been\nfor almost nine hundred years.' So from one to another they will go\nproclaiming his achievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and\nthe others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his\nroyal palace, and as soon as he beholds the knight, recognising him by\nhis arms and the device on his shield, he will as a matter of course say,\n'What ho! Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive the flower of\nchivalry who cometh hither!' At which command all will issue forth, and\nhe himself, advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely,\nand salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\nqueen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\ndaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels\nthat could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known\nworld. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon\nthe knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the other something\nmore divine than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be\ntaken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely\ndistressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and\nsufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some\nrichly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour,\nthey will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself,\nand if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a\ndoublet. When night comes he will sup with the king, queen, and princess;\nand all the time he will never take his eyes off her, stealing stealthy\nglances, unnoticed by those present, and she will do the same, and with\nequal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of great discretion.\nThe tables being removed, suddenly through the door of the hall there\nwill enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame,\nbetween two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an\nancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight\nin the world.\n\n\"The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will\nbring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great\nenhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will\nesteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her\nthoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or\nwhatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful\nas himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his\ncourt, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The\nking will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his\nhands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of\nhis lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps,\nwhich looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times\nconversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a\ndamsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the\ndamsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and\nfor the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at\nlast the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands\nthrough the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a\nthousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between\nthem how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes,\nand the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as\npossible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he\nkisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh\nready to die. He betakes him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his\nbed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes\nto take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his\nleave of the pair, it is told him that the princess is indisposed and\ncannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his\ndeparture, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from\nshowing his pain. The confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell\nher mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest\ndistresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly\nlineage or not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness,\nand gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any\nsave one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and\nshe strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her\nparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile the\nknight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the king's\nenemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to the court,\nsees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed that he\nshall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his\nservices; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he is,\nbut nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be,\nthe princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard it as\nvery good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the\nson of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is\nnot likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and\nin two words the knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the\nbestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising\nto so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the\nprincess's, who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their\namour, and is daughter of a very great duke.\"\n\n\"That's what I want, and no mistake about it!\" said Sancho. \"That's what\nI'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your\nworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\n\"Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for in the same\nmanner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant\nrise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find\nout what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful\ndaughter; but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have\ntold thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the\ncourt. There is another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we\nfind a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have\nwon incredible fame throughout the universe, I know not how it can be\nmade out that I am of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor;\nfor the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage\nunless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my\nfamous deeds may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall\nlose what my arm has fairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known\nhouse, of estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos\nmulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so\nclear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth\nin descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that there\nare two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and\nderiving their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced\nlittle by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down;\nand others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step\nuntil they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the one\nwere what they no longer are, and the others are what they formerly were\nnot. And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove\ngreat and famous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be,\nought to be satisfied; and should he not be, the princess will so love me\nthat even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she\nwill take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not,\nthen it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for\ntime or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.\"\n\n\"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people say,\n'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would\nfit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.' I\nsay so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law, will\nnot condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it\nbut, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the\nmischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\nenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards\ngo, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes\nwith the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until\nHeaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose, may as well\ngive her to him at once for a lawful wife.\"\n\n\"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Then since that may be,\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to\ncommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.\"\n\n\"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and mean be he who thinks himself mean.\"\n\n\"In God's name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old Christian, and\nto fit me for a count that's enough.\"\n\n\"And more than enough for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou\nnot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\ngive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when\nI make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say\nwhat they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee 'your\nlordship,' whether they like it or not.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle,\" said\nSancho.\n\n\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master.\n\n\"So be it,\" answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once\nin my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so\nwell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\nbrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my back,\nor dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe they'll come a\nhundred leagues to see me.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard\noften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost\nnot shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at\nthe distance of a musket shot.\"\n\n\"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than having a barber, and keeping\nhim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\ngo behind me like a nobleman's equerry.\"\n\n\"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\" asked\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month at the\ncapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\nsaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every\nturn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not\njoin the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me\nthat he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have\nsuch persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never\nforgotten it.\"\n\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest\ncarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\ntogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's\nbeard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse.\"\n\n\"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said Sancho; \"and your\nworship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\"\n\n\"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what\nwill be told in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nOF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST\nTHEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO\n\n\nCide Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this\nmost grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that\nafter the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his\nsquire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one,\nDon Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was\nfollowing some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads,\non a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them\nthere came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback\nwith wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as\nsoon as Sancho saw them he said:\n\n\"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of\nthe king's orders.\"\n\n\"How by force?\" asked Don Quixote; \"is it possible that the king uses\nforce against anyone?\"\n\n\"I do not say that,\" answered Sancho, \"but that these are people\ncondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" replied Don Quixote, \"however it may be, these people are\ngoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Then if so,\" said Don Quixote, \"here is a case for the exercise of my\noffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\"\n\n\"Recollect, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"Justice, which is the king\nhimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing\nthem for their crimes.\"\n\nThe chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in\nvery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good\nenough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting\nthese people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that\nthey were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to\nthe galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any\nbusiness to know.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I should like to know from each of\nthem separately the reason of his misfortune;\" to this he added more to\nthe same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that\nthe other mounted guard said to him:\n\n\"Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of\nevery one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read\nthem; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they\nwill, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about\nrascalities.\"\n\nWith this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they\nnot granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what\noffences he was now in such a sorry case.\n\nHe made answer that it was for being a lover.\n\n\"For that only?\" replied Don Quixote; \"why, if for being lovers they send\npeople to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.\"\n\n\"The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,\" said the galley\nslave; \"mine was that I loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen so\nwell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had\nnot forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to\nthis moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture,\nthe case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back,\nand three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.\"\n\n\"What are gurapas?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"Gurapas are galleys,\" answered the galley slave, who was a young man of\nabout four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.\n\nDon Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so\ndowncast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said,\n\"He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"for being musicians and singers are people\nsent to the galleys too?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the galley slave, \"for there is nothing worse than\nsinging under suffering.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I have heard say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that he who sings\nscares away his woes.\"\n\n\"Here it is the reverse,\" said the galley slave; \"for he who sings once\nweeps all his life.\"\n\n\"I do not understand it,\" said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said to\nhim, \"Sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity\nto confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he\nconfessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a\ncattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in\nthe galleys, besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the\nback; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves\nthat were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer,\nand despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay;\nfor, say they, 'nay' has no more letters in it than 'yea,' and a culprit\nis well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not\non that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very\nfar out.\"\n\n\"And I think so too,\" answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third\nhe asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered very\nreadily and unconcernedly, \"I am going for five years to their ladyships\nthe gurapas for the want of ten ducats.\"\n\n\"I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,\" said\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"That,\" said the galley slave, \"is like a man having money at sea when he\nis dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so\nbecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your\nworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen and\nfreshened up the attorney's wit with them, so that to-day I should be in\nthe middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road\ncoupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience--there, that's\nenough of it.\"\n\nDon Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\nwhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\nreason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the\nfifth acted as his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to the\ngalleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on\nhorseback.\"\n\n\"That means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to\nshame in public.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which they gave\nhim that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I\nmean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having\nbesides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\"\n\n\"If that touch had not been thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not\ndeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\nand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being\nthe office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered\nstate, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there\nought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and\nrecognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the\nevils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being\nin the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or less\nsilly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on\nthe most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed,\nlet the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is\ntheir right hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show\nthat it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an\noffice in the state, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I\nwill expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all I\nsay now is, that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed\nthe sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable\ncountenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp;\nthough I know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or\ncompel the will as some simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is\nthere herb or charm that can force it. All that certain silly women and\nquacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that\nthey have power to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to\ncompel the will.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the\ncharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\ncannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\nonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace\nand quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were\nunavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from,\nwith this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives\nme a moment's ease;\" and again he fell to weeping as before, and such\ncompassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from\nhis bosom and gave it to him in alms.\n\nDon Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man\nanswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last\none.\n\n\"I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of\nmine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short,\nI carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a\ncomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:\nit was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was near\nhaving my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years,\nI accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man;\nlet life only last, and with that all will come right. If you, sir, have\nanything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven,\nand we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the\nlife and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good as\nyour amiable appearance deserves.\"\n\nThis one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he was\na great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.\n\nBehind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\nexcept that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\nother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his\nneck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\n\"keep-friend\" or \"friend's foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to\nhis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured\nby a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth\nnor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried\nso many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was\nbecause he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\ntogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched\nhim in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of\nhis making his escape.\n\n\"What crimes can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have not\ndeserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\"\n\n\"He goes for ten years,\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as\ncivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\nfamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\"\n\n\"Gently, senor commissary,\" said the galley slave at this, \"let us have\nno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\nfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his\nown business, and he will be doing enough.\"\n\n\"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" replied\nthe commissary, \"if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue in\nspite of your teeth.\"\n\n\"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \"that man goes as God\npleases, but some one shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo\nde Parapilla or not.\"\n\n\"Don't they call you so, you liar?\" said the guard.\n\n\"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over calling me so,\nor I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you, sir, have\nanything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you\nare becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of\nothers; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de\nPasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\"\n\n\"He says true,\" said the commissary, \"for he has himself written his\nstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn\nfor two hundred reals.\"\n\n\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for\ntwo hundred ducats.\"\n\n\"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"So good is it,\" replied Gines, \"that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,'\nand all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared\nwith it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts\nso neat and diverting that no lies could match them.\"\n\n\"And how is the book entitled?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'\" replied the subject of it.\n\n\"And is it finished?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"How can it be finished,\" said the other, \"when my life is not yet\nfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when\nthey sent me to the galleys this last time.\"\n\n\"Then you have been there before?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years\nbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are\nlike,\" replied Gines; \"and it is no great grievance to me to go back to\nthem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many\nthings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enough\nleisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have\nit by heart.\"\n\n\"You seem a clever fellow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"And an unfortunate one,\" replied Gines, \"for misfortune always\npersecutes good wit.\"\n\n\"It persecutes rogues,\" said the commissary.\n\n\"I told you already to go gently, master commissary,\" said Pasamonte;\n\"their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us\nwretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;\nif not, by the life of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains\nmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his\ntongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we\nhave had quite enough of this entertainment.\"\n\nThe commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his\nthreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use\nhim, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have\nhis tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:\n\n\"From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though\nthey have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to\nendure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much\nagainst the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want\nof courage under torture, that one's want of money, the other's want of\nadvocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been\nthe cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had\non your side. All which presents itself now to my mind, urging,\npersuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate in your case the\npurpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and caused me to make\nprofession of the order of chivalry to which I belong, and the vow I took\ntherein to give aid to those in need and under the oppression of the\nstrong. But as I know that it is a mark of prudence not to do by foul\nmeans what may be done by fair, I will ask these gentlemen, the guards\nand commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go in peace,\nas there will be no lack of others to serve the king under more\nfavourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves\nof those whom God and nature have made free. Moreover, sirs of the\nguard,\" added Don Quixote, \"these poor fellows have done nothing to you;\nlet each answer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who\nwill not forget to punish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not\nfitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to\nothers, they being therein no way concerned. This request I make thus\ngently and quietly, that, if you comply with it, I may have reason for\nthanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily, this lance and sword\ntogether with the might of my arm shall compel you to comply with it by\nforce.\"\n\n\"Nice nonsense!\" said the commissary; \"a fine piece of pleasantry he has\ncome out with at last! He wants us to let the king's prisoners go, as if\nwe had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go your\nway, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you've got\non your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat.\"\n\n\"'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\" replied Don Quixote, and\nacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him\ntime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a\nlance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the\nmusket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this\nunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback\nseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don\nQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it\nwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance\nbefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving\nto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,\nthat the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking\nloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at\nall that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to\nrelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the\nplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,\ntook from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and\nlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of\nthe guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\nPasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley\nslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair,\nbecause he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to\nthe Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once\nsally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to his master, and\nentreated him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the\nsierra that was close by.\n\n\"That is all very well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know what must be done\nnow;\" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now running\nriot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected them\nround him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: \"To\nbe grateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth,\nand one of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I say so\nbecause, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have\nreceived of me; in return for which I desire, and it is my good pleasure\nthat, laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks, ye at once\nset out and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present\nyourselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her\nknight, he of the Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her;\nand that ye recount to her in full detail all the particulars of this\nnotable adventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and\nthis done ye may go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.\"\n\nGines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, \"That which you, sir, our\ndeliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible to\ncomply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but only\nsingly and separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hide\nourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood,\nwhich, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship may do,\nand fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which\nwe will say for your worship's intention, and this is a condition that\ncan be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or\nin war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots\nof Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to\nimagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning,\nand to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.\"\n\n\"Then by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), \"Don\nson of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you\nwill have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the\nwhole chain on your back.\"\n\nPasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly\nconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had\ncommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in\nthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they\nbegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite\nunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more\nheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself\nbehind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that\npoured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well\nbut that more pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with\nsuch force that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell\nthe student pounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with\nit struck three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the\nground, knocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket\nthat he wore over his armour, and they would have stripped off his\nstockings if his greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took\nhis coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves\nthe remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more\nsolicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than\nabout burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves\nbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and\nDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping\nhead, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the\nstorm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched\nbeside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;\nSancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don\nQuixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he\nhad done so much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE\nRAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY\n\n\nSeeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"I\nhave always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw\nwater into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided\nthis trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take\nwarning for the future.\"\n\n\"Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\" returned Sancho;\n\"but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had\nbelieved me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for\nI tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they\ndon't care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I\ncan tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this\nminute.\"\n\n\"Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but lest thou\nshouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise,\nthis once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury\nthou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or\nin death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this\ndanger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if\nthou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that,\nand from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie\nevery time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at\nthe mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above\nall from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with\nit, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy\nBrotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes\nof Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the\nbrothers and brotherhoods in the world.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"to retire is not to flee, and there is no\nwisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise\nmen to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one\nday; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some\nnotion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my\nadvice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help you; and\nfollow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than\nhands just now.\"\n\nDon Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his\nass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as\nit was Sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso\nor Almodovar del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to\nescape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them.\nHe was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock of provisions\ncarried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the galley slaves,\na circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how they pillaged\nand ransacked.\n\nThat night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it\nseemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least\nas many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped between\ntwo rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which, according\nto the opinion of those who have not the light of the true faith,\ndirects, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so ordered it\nthat Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by the virtue and\nmadness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain, driven by fear\nof the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to dread, resolved to\ntake hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same\nspot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been led by theirs, just\nin time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the\nwicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and\nimmediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, Gines,\nwho was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal\nSancho Panza's ass, not troubling himself about Rocinante, as being a\nprize that was no good either to pledge or sell. While Sancho slept he\nstole his ass, and before day dawned he was far out of reach.\n\nAurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness to\nSancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing\nhimself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the\nworld, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard him\nsaying, \"O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children's\nplaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my\nburdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the\nsix-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my charges.\"\n\nDon Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled\nSancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,\nand promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of five\nass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took comfort at\nthis, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned thanks for the\nkindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was rejoiced to the\nheart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him to be just the\nplace for the adventures he was in quest of. They brought back to his\nmemory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in like\nsolitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, so\nabsorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anything\nelse.\n\nNor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in a\nsafe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were left\nof the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden with\nwhat Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his paunch, and\nso long as he could go that way, he would not have given a farthing to\nmeet with another adventure.\n\nWhile so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,\nand was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object that\nlay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him if it\nwere needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he was\nraising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or rather wholly\nrotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to take\nthem up, and his master directed him to see what the valise contained.\nSancho did so with great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by a\nchain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to see\nits contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articles\nof linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a\ngood lot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:\n\n\"Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for\nsomething!\"\n\nSearching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this\nDon Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for\nhimself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise\nof its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering the\nwhole matter, Don Quixote observed:\n\n\"It seems to me, Sancho--and it is impossible it can be otherwise-that\nsome strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked\nand slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury him.\"\n\n\"That cannot be,\" answered Sancho, \"because if they had been robbers they\nwould not have left this money.\"\n\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I cannot guess or explain what\nthis may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is\nanything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what we\nwant to know.\"\n\nHe opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but in\na very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might\nhear it, he found that it ran as follows:\n\nSONNET\n\nOr Love is lacking in intelligence,\n  Or to the height of cruelty attains,\n  Or else it is my doom to suffer pains\nBeyond the measure due to my offence.\nBut if Love be a God, it follows thence\n  That he knows all, and certain it remains\n  No God loves cruelty; then who ordains\nThis penance that enthrals while it torments?\nIt were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;\n  Such evil with such goodness cannot live;\nAnd against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,\n  I only know it is my fate to die.\n  To him who knows not whence his malady\n  A miracle alone a cure can give.\n\n\"There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,\" said Sancho, \"unless by\nthat clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.\"\n\n\"What clue is there?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"I only said Chloe,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and that no doubt, is the name\nof the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, he\nmust be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.\"\n\n\"Then your worship understands rhyming too?\"\n\n\"And better than thou thinkest,\" replied Don Quixote, \"as thou shalt see\nwhen thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to my\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all or\nmost of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and\ngreat musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly\nspeaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is\nthat the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in\nthem.\"\n\n\"Read more, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"and you will find something that\nwill enlighten us.\"\n\nDon Quixote turned the page and said, \"This is prose and seems to be a\nletter.\"\n\n\"A correspondence letter, senor?\"\n\n\"From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,\" replied Don Quixote.\n\n\"Then let your worship read it aloud,\" said Sancho, \"for I am very fond\nof love matters.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho had\nrequested him, he found it ran thus:\n\nThy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the\nnews of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.\nUngrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not more\nworthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy the\nfortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy beauty\nraised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel,\nby them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast sent war to\nme, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden from\nthee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not a\nrevenge I would not have.\n\nWhen he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, \"There is less to be\ngathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is\nsome rejected lover;\" and turning over nearly all the pages of the book\nhe found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while\nothers he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,\nmisgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some\nrapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho\nexamined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the\npad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did\nnot rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything\nshould escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness\nexcited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a\nhundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket flights,\nbalsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs, missing\nalforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and weariness he had\nendured in the service of his good master, cheap at the price; as he\nconsidered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he\nreceived in the gift of the treasure-trove.\n\nThe Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out\nwho the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and\nletter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that\nhe must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his\nlady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and\nrugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw\nnothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante\nchose--which was where he could make his way--firmly persuaded that among\nthese wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went\nalong, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of\na height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock\nto rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as\nhe could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled\nhair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches\napparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in\nseveral places.\n\nHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed\nas has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and\nnoted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to\nfollow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make\nway over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish\nby nature. Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the\nowner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in\nsearch of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those\nmountains before he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short\ncut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other,\nand perhaps by this means they might light upon this man who had passed\nso quickly out of their sight.\n\n\"I could not do that,\" said Sancho, \"for when I separate from your\nworship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of\npanics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this\ntime forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence.\"\n\n\"It shall be so,\" said he of the Rueful Countenance, \"and I am very glad\nthat thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee,\neven though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind me\nslowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us\nmake the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that\nwe saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.\"\n\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"Far better would it be not to look for him,\nfor, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it is\nplain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that without\ntaking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in\nsome other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be\ndiscovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then\nthe king will hold me harmless.\"\n\n\"Thou art wrong there, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for now that we have a\nsuspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound\nto seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong\nsuspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he\nwere so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him give thee any\nuneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.\"\n\nAnd so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on foot\nand loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they\nfound lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by\njackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further\nstrengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the\nmule and the saddle-pad.\n\nAs they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd\nwatching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great\nnumber of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the\ngoatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called\naloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted\nin return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never\ntrodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild\nbeasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down, and they\nwould explain all to him.\n\nThe goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,\nhe said, \"I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead\nin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six\nmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\"\n\n\"We have come upon nobody,\" answered Don Quixote, \"nor on anything except\na saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.\"\n\n\"I found it too,\" said the goatherd, \"but I would not lift it nor go near\nit for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil\nis crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall without\nknowing why or wherefore.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I say,\" said Sancho; \"I found it too, and I would\nnot go within a stone's throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies\njust as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.\"\n\n\"Tell me, good man,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you know who is the owner of\nthis property?\"\n\n\"All I can tell you,\" said the goatherd, \"is that about six months ago,\nmore or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,\naway from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on\nthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and\nvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part\nof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was\nwhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league\nfarther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am\nwondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or path\nthat leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the\nyouth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving\nus all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the\nhaste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and\nafter that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the\npath of one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up\nto him and gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass\nwith our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and\nhaving done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary\nswiftness. When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of\nhim for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at\nthe end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork\ntree. He came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now\ntorn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly\nrecognised him but that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the\nrecollection we had of them, that he was the person we were looking for.\nHe saluted us courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not\nto wonder at seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon\nhim in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had\nbeen imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were\nnever able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in\nwant of food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should\nfind him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness;\nor if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and\nnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,\nbegged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask it\nin God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode,\nhe said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever night\nmight overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so\nbitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we not\njoined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with what\nwe saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in\nhis courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good birth\nand courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to him, even\nto our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.\n\n\"But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we\nstood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction;\nand with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at the\nground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again\nclosing them, compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows, we could\nperceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him;\nand before long he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he\narose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown himself, and attacked\nthe first he found near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had\nnot dragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all\nthe while exclaiming, 'Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay\nthe penalty of the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out\nthat heart of thine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit\nand fraud above all; and to these he added other words all in effect\nupbraiding this Fernando and charging him with treachery and\nfaithlessness.\n\n\"We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and without\nanother word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes\nand brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him; from this\nwe suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and that some\none called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such\nas the condition to which it had brought him seemed to show. All this has\nbeen since then confirmed on those occasions, and they have been many, on\nwhich he has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to give\nhim some of the food they carry, at another to take it from them by\nforce; for when there is a fit of madness upon him, even though the\nshepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it but snatches it from\nthem by dint of blows; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the\nlove of God, courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks\nand not a few tears. And to tell you the truth, sirs,\" continued the\ngoatherd, \"it was yesterday that we resolved, I and four of the lads, two\nof them our servants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search\nof him until we find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or\nof his own consent, to the town of Almodovar, which is eight leagues from\nthis, and there strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a\ncure), or learn when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has\nrelatives to whom we may give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is\nall I can say in answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the\nowner of the articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such\nnimbleness and so naked.\"\n\nFor Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go bounding\nalong the mountain side, and he was now filled with amazement at what he\nheard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who the\nunhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before,\nto search for him all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or cave\nunexamined until he had found him. But chance arranged matters better\nthan he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the\nmountain that opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made\nhis appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have\nbeen unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was\nwhat has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived\nthat a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he\nconcluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.\n\nApproaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but\nwith great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal\npoliteness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred\nbearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his\narms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may call\nthe Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the\nRueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,\nplacing his hands on Don Quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as if\nseeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the\nsight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was\nat the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was\nthe Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA\n\n\nThe history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote\nlistened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:\n\n\"Of a surety, senor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for\nthe proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were\nin a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which\nyou have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me;\nbut my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses\ndone me save the hearty desire to repay them.\"\n\n\"Mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is to be of service to you, so much so that\nI had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, and\nlearned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that\nsorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour;\nand to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been\nnecessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those that\nrefuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join\nyou in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I could; for it is still\nsome comfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it. And if my\ngood intentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy, I\nentreat you, senor, by that which I perceive you possess in so high a\ndegree, and likewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best\nin life, to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to\nlive or die in these solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in\na manner so foreign to your condition as your garb and appearance show.\nAnd I swear,\" added Don Quixote, \"by the order of knighthood which I have\nreceived, and by my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this,\nto serve you with all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in\nrelieving your misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in\nlamenting it as I promised to do.\"\n\nThe Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk in\nthis strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, and\nagain survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly examined\nhim, he said to him:\n\n\"If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, and\nafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the\ngoodwill you have displayed towards me.\"\n\nSancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the\nRagged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave him\nhe ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time between\nmouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate neither he\nnor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had done he made\nsigns to them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green\nplot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock. On\nreaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the\nsame, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his\nplace, said:\n\n\"If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the\nsurpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the\nthread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the\ninstant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.\"\n\nThese words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire\nhad told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed\nthe river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged\nOne, he went on to say:\n\n\"I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of\nmy misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh\nones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the\nrecital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in\norder fully to satisfy your curiosity.\"\n\nDon Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this\nassurance he began as follows:\n\n\"My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this\nAndalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that\nmy parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being\nable by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do\nlittle to relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country there was\na heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could desire; such was\nthe beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of\nhappier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a\npassion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored from my\nearliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the innocence and\nsincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our feelings, and were\nnot sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly that as they ripened\nthey must lead at last to a marriage between us, a thing that seemed\nalmost prearranged by the equality of our families and wealth. We grew\nup, and with our growth grew the love between us, so that the father of\nLuscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to refuse me admission to his\nhouse, in this perhaps imitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated\nby the poets, and this refusal but added love to love and flame to flame;\nfor though they enforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose\nit upon our pens, which can make known the heart's secrets to a loved one\nmore freely than tongues; for many a time the presence of the object of\nlove shakes the firmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah\nheavens! how many letters did I write her, and how many dainty modest\nreplies did I receive! how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in\nwhich my heart declared and made known its feelings, described its ardent\nlongings, revelled in its recollections and dallied with its desires! At\nlength growing impatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to\nsee her, I resolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me\nthe best mode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her\nfather for my lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he\nthanked me for the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard\nmyself as honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father\nwas alive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in\naccordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be taken\nor given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting that\nthere was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent to it\nas soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very same\ninstant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered the room\nwhere he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which, before I\ncould utter a word, he gave me, saying, 'By this letter thou wilt see,\nCardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.' This Duke\nRicardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who\nhas his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I took and read the\nletter, which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt\nit would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke\nmade in it, which was that he would send me immediately to him, as he\nwished me to become the companion, not servant, of his eldest son, and\nwould take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position\ncorresponding to the esteem in which he held me. On reading the letter my\nvoice failed me, and still more when I heard my father say, 'Two days\nhence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with the duke's wish, and\ngive thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest\nattain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others\nof fatherly counsel. The time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night\nto Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did also to her\nfather, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of\nher hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave\nme the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered.\nFinally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by\nhim so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants\ngrowing envious of me, and regarding the duke's inclination to show me\nfavour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave\nthe greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a\ngallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon\nmade so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for\nthough the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not\ncarry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It\nso happened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared,\nand as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship,\nhe made all his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair\nwhich troubled his mind a little. He was deeply in love with a peasant\ngirl, a vassal of his father's, the daughter of wealthy parents, and\nherself so beautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who\nknew her was able to decide in which of these respects she was most\nhighly gifted or most excelled. The attractions of the fair peasant\nraised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain\nhis object and overcome her virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge\nhis word to her to become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way\nwas to attempt an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I\nstrove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think\nof to restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I\nproduced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father,\nacquainted with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and\nshrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a\ngood servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to\nthe honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he\ntold me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty\nthat so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months, and that\nhe wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us, to my\nfather's house under the pretence, which he would make to the duke, of\ngoing to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city, which\nproduces the best in the world. When I heard him say so, even if his\nresolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed it as one of\nthe happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my affection, seeing\nwhat a favourable chance and opportunity it offered me of returning to\nsee my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I commended his idea and\nencouraged his design, advising him to put it into execution as quickly\nas possible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect in spite of the\nmost deeply rooted feelings. But, as afterwards appeared, when he said\nthis to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title of\nhusband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with\nsafety to himself, being in dread of what his father the duke would do\nwhen he came to know of his folly. It happened, then, that as with young\nmen love is for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its\nfinal object is enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that\nwhich seemed to be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit\nfixed by nature, which fixes no limit to true love--what I mean is that\nafter Don Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and\nhis eagerness cooled, and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself\nin order to cure his love, he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid\nkeeping his promise.\n\n\"The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we\narrived at my city, and my father gave him the reception due to his rank;\nI saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or\ndeadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of\nit to Don Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great friendship\nhe bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him. I extolled her\nbeauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises excited in him a\ndesire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions. To my misfortune I\nyielded to it, showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a\nwindow where we used to talk to one another. As she appeared to him in\nher dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out\nof his recollection; speech failed him, his head turned, he was\nspell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you will see in the course\nof the story of my misfortune; and to inflame still further his passion,\nwhich he hid from me and revealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that\none day he found a note of hers entreating me to demand her of her father\nin marriage, so delicate, so modest, and so tender, that on reading it he\ntold me that in Luscinda alone were combined all the charms of beauty and\nunderstanding that were distributed among all the other women in the\nworld. It is true, and I own it now, that though I knew what good cause\nDon Fernando had to praise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these\npraises from his mouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel\ndistrust of him, for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of\nLuscinda, and he would start the subject himself even though he dragged\nit in unseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of\njealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of\nLuscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me\nagainst. Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to\nLuscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the\nwit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda having begged\nof me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of, Amadis\nof Gaul-\"\n\nDon Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:\n\n\"Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady\nLuscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have\nbeen requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding,\nfor it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for\nsuch delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you\nneed waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and\nintelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to\nbe the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I\nwish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the worthy Don\nRugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish\nDaraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and\nthe admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered by him with such\nsprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when this omission can\nbe remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your\nworship to be so good as to come with me to my village, for there I can\ngive you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul\nand the entertainment of my life;--though it occurs to me that I have not\ngot one of them now, thanks to the spite of wicked and envious\nenchanters;--but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to\ninterrupt your discourse; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant\nmentioned, I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun\ncan help giving heat, or those of the moon moisture; pardon me,\ntherefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now.\"\n\nWhile Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon\nhis breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice Don\nQuixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered a\nword in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, \"I cannot\nget rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me\nthink otherwise--and he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe\nanything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with\nQueen Madasima.\"\n\n\"That is not true, by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote in high wrath,\nturning upon him angrily, as his way was; \"and it is a very great\nslander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady,\nand it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made\nfree with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great\nscoundrel, and I will give him to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed\nor unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best.\"\n\nCardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come\nupon him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would Don\nQuixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about Madasima\ndisgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were in\nearnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books\nbrought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he heard\nhimself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names,\nnot relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and\nwith it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote's breast that he laid him on\nhis back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion,\nattacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him\nin such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet,\nand then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the\ngoatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten\nand pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his\nhiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at\nfinding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance\non the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man\nwas at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would\nhave been on their guard to protect themselves. The goatherd replied that\nhe had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of\nhis. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation\nended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such\nfisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they\nwould have knocked one another to pieces.\n\n\"Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\" said Sancho,\ngrappling with the goatherd, \"for of this fellow, who is a clown like\nmyself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the\naffront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest\nman.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know that he is not to blame for\nwhat has happened.\"\n\nWith this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be\npossible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the\nend of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that\nthere was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he\nwandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in\nwith him either in or out of his senses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF\nLA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF\nBELTENEBROS\n\n\nDon Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante\nbade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly.\nThey proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the\nmountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and\nlonging for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the\ninjunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to\nhim:\n\n\"Senor Don Quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal, for\nI'd like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at\nany rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go\nthrough these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a\nmind is burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as\nthey did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I\ncould talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up\nwith my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with\npatience, to go seeking adventures all one's life and get nothing but\nkicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have\nto sew up one's mouth without daring to say what is in one's heart, just\nas if one were dumb.\"\n\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"thou art dying to have\nthe interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and\nsay what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Sancho; \"let me speak now, for God knows what will\nhappen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask,\nwhat made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever\nher name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of\nhers or not? for if your worship had let that pass--and you were not a\njudge in the matter--it is my belief the madman would have gone on with\nhis story, and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a\ndozen cuffs would have been escaped.\"\n\n\"In faith, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"if thou knewest as I do what\nan honourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thou\nwouldst say I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth\nthat uttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say or\nimagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truth of the story\nis that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of great\nprudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to the\nqueen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving\nvery severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he\nwas saying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits.\"\n\n\"That is what I say,\" said Sancho; \"there was no occasion for minding the\nwords of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship, and he\nhad sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine way we\nshould have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God confound her!\nAnd then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?\"\n\n\"Against men in their senses or against madmen,\" said Don Quixote, \"every\nknight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women, whoever they\nmay be, much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as Queen\nMadasima, for whom I have a particular regard on account of her amiable\nqualities; for, besides being extremely beautiful, she was very wise, and\nvery patient under her misfortunes, of which she had many; and the\ncounsel and society of the Master Elisabad were a great help and support\nto her in enduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the\nignorant and ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she\nwas his mistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two\nhundred times more, all who think and say so.\"\n\n\"I neither say nor think so,\" said Sancho; \"let them look to it; with\ntheir bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whether\nthey misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am not\nfond of prying into other men's lives; he who buys and lies feels it in\nhis purse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither\nlose nor gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think there are\nflitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates to the open\nplain? moreover they said of God-\"\n\n\"God bless me,\" said Don Quixote, \"what a set of absurdities thou art\nstringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do with the\nproverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God's sake hold thy\ntongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don't\nmeddle in what does not concern thee; and understand with all thy five\nsenses that everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is well\nfounded on reason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for I\nunderstand them better than all the world that profess them.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"is it a good rule of chivalry that we should go\nastray through these mountains without path or road, looking for a madman\nwho when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began,\nnot his story, but your worship's head and my ribs, and end by breaking\nthem altogether for us?\"\n\n\"Peace, I say again, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for let me tell thee it\nis not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into these\nregions as that which I have of performing among them an achievement\nwherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world;\nand it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on all that can\nmake a knight-errant perfect and famous.\"\n\n\"And is it very perilous, this achievement?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied he of the Rueful Countenance; \"though it may be in the dice\nthat we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend on thy\ndiligence.\"\n\n\"On my diligence!\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if thou dost return soon from the place\nwhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory\nwill soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in\nsuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee know,\nSancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect\nknights-errant--I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first,\nthe only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig\nfor Don Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in any respect,\nfor, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I say, too, that\nwhen a painter desires to become famous in his art he endeavours to copy\nthe originals of the rarest painters that he knows; and the same rule\nholds good for all the most important crafts and callings that serve to\nadorn a state; thus must he who would be esteemed prudent and patient\nimitate Ulysses, in whose person and labours Homer presents to us a\nlively picture of prudence and patience; as Virgil, too, shows us in the\nperson of AEneas the virtue of a pious son and the sagacity of a brave\nand skilful captain; not representing or describing them as they were,\nbut as they ought to be, so as to leave the example of their virtues to\nposterity. In the same way Amadis was the polestar, day-star, sun of\nvaliant and devoted knights, whom all we who fight under the banner of\nlove and chivalry are bound to imitate. This, then, being so, I consider,\nfriend Sancho, that the knight-errant who shall imitate him most closely\nwill come nearest to reaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the\ninstances in which this knight most conspicuously showed his prudence,\nworth, valour, endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew,\nrejected by the Lady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pena Pobre, changing\nhis name into that of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and\nappropriate to the life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is\neasier for me to imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder,\ncutting off serpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying\nfleets, and breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited\nfor a similar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which\nnow so conveniently offers me its forelock.\"\n\n\"What is it in reality,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship means to do in\nsuch an out-of-the-way place as this?\"\n\n\"Have I not told thee,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I mean to imitate\nAmadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so as\nat the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the fountain\nhe had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro\nand through grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees, troubled the\nwaters of the clear springs, slew destroyed flocks, burned down huts,\nlevelled houses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred\nthousand other outrages worthy of everlasting renown and record? And\nthough I have no intention of imitating Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando\n(for he went by all these names), step by step in all the mad things he\ndid, said, and thought, I will make a rough copy to the best of my power\nof all that seems to me most essential; but perhaps I shall content\nmyself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who without giving way to any\nmischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, gained as much fame\nas the most famous.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Sancho, \"that the knights who behaved in this way\nhad provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause\nhas your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or what\nevidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has\nbeen trifling with Moor or Christian?\"\n\n\"There is the point,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and that is the beauty of\nthis business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he\nhas cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my\nlady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist;\nmoreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from\nmy lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that\nshepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and\nfeared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me against so\nrare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must\nbe until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send\nby thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves,\nmy insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite\neffect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no\nmore; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the\nstruggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my\nsenses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou\nbringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou got Mambrino's helmet safe?\nfor I saw thee take it up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch\ntried to break it in pieces but could not, by which the fineness of its\ntemper may be seen.\"\n\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"By the living God, Sir Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the things\nthat your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that all you\ntell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and giving\nislands, and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of\nknights-errant, must be all made up of wind and lies, and all pigments or\nfigments, or whatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that\nheard your worship calling a barber's basin Mambrino's helmet without\never seeing the mistake all this time, but that one who says and\nmaintains such things must have his brains addled? I have the basin in my\nsack all dinted, and I am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my\nbeard in it, if, by God's grace, I am allowed to see my wife and children\nsome day or other.\"\n\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"by him thou didst swear by just\nnow I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in\nthe world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast\nbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all things\nbelonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and\nravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is so,\nbut because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us\nthat change and alter everything with us, and turn things as they please,\nand according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems\nto thee a barber's basin seems to me Mambrino's helmet, and to another it\nwill seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on\nmy side to make what is really and truly Mambrine's helmet seem a basin\nto everybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the world\nwould pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber's\nbasin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by\nhim who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it,\nfor, by my faith, had he known it he would never have left it behind.\nKeep it safe, my friend, for just now I have no need of it; indeed, I\nshall have to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born,\nif I have a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.\"\n\nThus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like an\nisolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base there\nflowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and\nluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest\ntrees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the\nspot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his\nchoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it exclaimed\nin a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:\n\n\"This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for\nbewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this is\nthe spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of\nyon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly\nthe leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and token of the pain my\npersecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye be that\nhaunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom\nlong absence and brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among\nthese wilds and complain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful\none, the end and limit of all human beauty! Oh, ye wood nymphs and\ndryads, that dwell in the thickets of the forest, so may the nimble\nwanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed never disturb your sweet\nrepose, help me to lament my hard fate or at least weary not at listening\nto it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my night, glory of my pain, guide\nof my path, star of my fortune, so may Heaven grant thee in full all thou\nseekest of it, bethink thee of the place and condition to which absence\nfrom thee has brought me, and make that return in kindness that is due to\nmy fidelity! Oh, lonely trees, that from this day forward shall bear me\ncompany in my solitude, give me some sign by the gentle movement of your\nboughs that my presence is not distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire,\npleasant companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy\nmemory what thou shalt see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and\nreport it to the sole cause of all,\" and so saying he dismounted from\nRocinante, and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and\ngiving him a slap on the croup, said, \"He gives thee freedom who is\nbereft of it himself, oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art\nunfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou wilt, for thou bearest written\non thy forehead that neither Astolfo's hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino\nthat cost Bradamante so dear, could equal thee in speed.\"\n\nSeeing this Sancho said, \"Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble\nof stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not have\ngone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise; though\nif he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there would be no\noccasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him,\ninasmuch as his master, which I was while it was God's pleasure, was\nnothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if\nmy departure and your worship's madness are to come off in earnest, it\nwill be as well to saddle Rocinante again in order that he may supply the\nwant of Dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for\nif I go on foot I don't know when I shall get there or when I shall get\nback, as I am, in truth, a bad walker.\"\n\n\"I declare, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"it shall be as thou wilt, for\nthy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou wilt\ndepart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and say for\nher sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.\"\n\n\"But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Much thou knowest about it!\" said Don Quixote. \"I have now got to tear\nup my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these\nrocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.\"\n\n\"For the love of God,\" said Sancho, \"be careful, your worship, how you\ngive yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such a\nrock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the whole\ncontrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks on the\nhead seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be done without\nthem, you might be content--as the whole thing is feigned, and\ncounterfeit, and in joke--you might be content, I say, with giving them\nto yourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; and\nleave it all to me; for I'll tell my lady that your worship knocked your\nhead against a point of rock harder than a diamond.\"\n\n\"I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,\" answered Don\nQuixote, \"but I would have thee know that all these things I am doing are\nnot in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be a\ntransgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell any\nlie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one thing\ninstead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the head\nmust be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or\nfanciful about them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint to\ndress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam\nwe lost.\"\n\n\"It was worse losing the ass,\" replied Sancho, \"for with him lint and all\nwere lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of that\naccursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearing the\nvery name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three days\nyou allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take them as seen\nalready and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful stories to my\nlady; so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to return\nand take your worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving you.\"\n\n\"Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote, \"rather call it\nhell, or even worse if there be anything worse.\"\n\n\"For one who is in hell,\" said Sancho, \"nulla est retentio, as I have\nheard say.\"\n\n\"I do not understand what retentio means,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Retentio,\" answered Sancho, \"means that whoever is in hell never comes\nnor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your worship\nor my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven Rocinante:\nlet me once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea,\nand I will tell her such things of the follies and madnesses (for it is\nall one) that your worship has done and is still doing, that I will\nmanage to make her softer than a glove though I find her harder than a\ncork tree; and with her sweet and honeyed answer I will come back through\nthe air like a witch, and take your worship out of this purgatory that\nseems to be hell but is not, as there is hope of getting out of it;\nwhich, as I have said, those in hell have not, and I believe your worship\nwill not say anything to the contrary.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said he of the Rueful Countenance, \"but how shall we\nmanage to write the letter?\"\n\n\"And the ass-colt order too,\" added Sancho.\n\n\"All shall be included,\" said Don Quixote; \"and as there is no paper, it\nwould be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the ancients\ndid, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to find just now\nas paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently and\neven more than conveniently written, and that is in the note-book that\nbelonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper,\nin a good hand, at the first village thou comest to where there is a\nschoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it; but see thou give it\nnot to any notary to copy, for they write a law hand that Satan could not\nmake out.\"\n\n\"But what is to be done about the signature?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"The letters of Amadis were never signed,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"That is all very well,\" said Sancho, \"but the order must needs be\nsigned, and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and I\nshall be left without ass-colts.\"\n\n\"The order shall go signed in the same book,\" said Don Quixote, \"and on\nseeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to the\nloveletter thou canst put by way of signature, 'Yours till death, the\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance.' And it will be no great matter if it\nis in some other person's hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcinea can\nneither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she seen\nhandwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been always\nplatonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that so seldom that I\ncan safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve years\nI have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earth\nwill one day devour; and perhaps even of those four times she has not\nonce perceived that I was looking at her: such is the retirement and\nseclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza\nNogales have brought her up.\"\n\n\"So, so!\" said Sancho; \"Lorenzo Corchuelo's daughter is the lady Dulcinea\ndel Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?\"\n\n\"She it is,\" said Don Quixote, \"and she it is that is worthy to be lady\nof the whole universe.\"\n\n\"I know her well,\" said Sancho, \"and let me tell you she can fling a\ncrowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!\nbut she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be\nhelpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his\nlady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can tell\nyou one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to\ncall some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her\nfather's, and though they were better than half a league off they heard\nher as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her\nis that she is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of affability, and\njokes with everybody, and has a grin and a jest for everything. So, Sir\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance, I say you not only may and ought to do\nmad freaks for her sake, but you have a good right to give way to despair\nand hang yourself; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well,\nthough the devil should take you; and I wish I were on my road already,\nsimply to see her, for it is many a day since I saw her, and she must be\naltered by this time, for going about the fields always, and the sun and\nthe air spoil women's looks greatly. But I must own the truth to your\nworship, Senor Don Quixote; until now I have been under a great mistake,\nfor I believed truly and honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some\nprincess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to\ndeserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the Biscayan and the\ngalley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won\nmany victories in the time when I was not yet your squire. But all things\nconsidered, what good can it do the lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, to have the vanquished your worship sends or will\nsend coming to her and going down on their knees before her? Because may\nbe when they came she'd be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing\nfloor, and they'd be ashamed to see her, and she'd laugh, or resent the\npresent.\"\n\n\"I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\nthou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou art\nalways striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and\nhow rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must\nknow that a certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above\nall free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young\nlay-brother; his superior came to know of it, and one day said to the\nworthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance, 'I am surprised, senora,\nand not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, so fair,\nand so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a mean, low,\nstupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are so many masters,\ngraduates, and divinity students from among whom you might choose as if\nthey were a lot of pears, saying this one I'll take, that I won't take;'\nbut she replied to him with great sprightliness and candour, 'My dear\nsir, you are very much mistaken, and your ideas are very old-fashioned,\nif you think that I have made a bad choice in So-and-so, fool as he\nseems; because for all I want with him he knows as much and more\nphilosophy than Aristotle.' In the same way, Sancho, for all I want with\nDulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the most exalted princess on\nearth. It is not to be supposed that all those poets who sang the praises\nof ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any such mistresses.\nThinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the\nDianas, the Galateas, the Filidas, and all the rest of them, that the\nbooks, the ballads, the barber's shops, the theatres are full of, were\nreally and truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that\nglorify and have glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent\nthem for the most part to furnish a subject for their verses, and that\nthey may pass for lovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it\nsuffices me to think and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair\nand virtuous; and as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no one\nwill examine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her,\nand I, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world.\nFor thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two things\nalone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great\nbeauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcinea\nin the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in good name\nfew approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade\nmyself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture\nher in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well in beauty as in\ncondition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor\nany other of the famous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin;\nand let each say what he will, for if in this I am taken to task by the\nignorant, I shall not be censured by the critical.\"\n\n\"I say that your worship is entirely right,\" said Sancho, \"and that I am\nan ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a rope\nis not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged; but now\nfor the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.\"\n\nDon Quixote took out the note-book, and, retiring to one side, very\ndeliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it he\ncalled to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might\ncommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil\nfortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho replied,\n\"Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me, and I\nwill carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my\nmemory is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often forget my\nown name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it,\nfor surely it will run as if it was in print.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Don Quixote, \"this is what it says:\n\n\n\"DON QUIXOTE'S LETTER TO DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\n\n\"Sovereign and exalted Lady,--The pierced by the point of absence, the\nwounded to the heart's core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso,\nthe health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me, if thy\nworth is not for me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I be\nsufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I endure this anxiety, which,\nbesides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho will\nrelate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to which\nI am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me relief, I\nam thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by ending my life I\nshall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire.\n\n\"Thine till death,\n\n\"The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\n\n\"By the life of my father,\" said Sancho, when he heard the letter, \"it is\nthe loftiest thing I ever heard. Body of me! how your worship says\neverything as you like in it! And how well you fit in 'The Knight of the\nRueful Countenance' into the signature. I declare your worship is indeed\nthe very devil, and there is nothing you don't know.\"\n\n\"Everything is needed for the calling I follow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Sancho, \"let your worship put the order for the three\nass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may\nrecognise it at first sight.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read\nit to this effect:\n\n\"Mistress Niece,--By this first of ass-colts please pay to Sancho Panza,\nmy squire, three of the five I left at home in your charge: said three\nass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received here in\nhand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done in\nthe heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of this\npresent year.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Sancho; \"now let your worship sign it.\"\n\n\"There is no need to sign it,\" said Don Quixote, \"but merely to put my\nflourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,\nor even three hundred.\"\n\n\"I can trust your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"let me go and saddle\nRocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at\nonce without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I'll say I\nsaw you do so many that she will not want any more.\"\n\n\"At any rate, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"I should like--and there is\nreason for it--I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to the skin\nand performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done in less\nthan half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou canst\nthen safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I promise thee\nthou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.\"\n\n\"For the love of God, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"let me not see your\nworship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able\nto keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night for\nDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your\nworship's pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in your\nclothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself want\nnothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of time for\nmy return, which will be with the news your worship desires and deserves.\nIf not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not answer\nreasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a fair answer\nout of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it be borne that\na knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme or\nreason for a--? Her ladyship had best not drive me to say it, for by God\nI will speak out and let off everything cheap, even if it doesn't sell: I\nam pretty good at that! she little knows me; faith, if she knew me she'd\nbe in awe of me.\"\n\n\"In faith, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"to all appearance thou art no\nsounder in thy wits than I.\"\n\n\"I am not so mad,\" answered Sancho, \"but I am more peppery; but apart\nfrom all this, what has your worship to eat until I come back? Will you\nsally out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?\"\n\n\"Let not that anxiety trouble thee,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for even if I\nhad it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which this\nmeadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business of mine\nlies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I am afraid of?\" said Sancho upon this; \"that I shall\nnot be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it\nis such an out-of-the-way place.\"\n\n\"Observe the landmarks well,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will try not to go\nfar from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the\nhighest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning; however,\nnot to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut some\nbranches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest\nto lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these\nwill serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of\nTheseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return.\"\n\n\"So I will,\" said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his\nmaster's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his\nleave of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him\nearnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the\nplain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had\nrecommended him; and so he went his way, though Don Quixote still\nentreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. He had not\ngone a hundred paces, however, when he returned and said:\n\n\"I must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be\nable to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you do\nmad things, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in\nyour worship's remaining here I have seen a very great one.\"\n\n\"Did I not tell thee so?\" said Don Quixote. \"Wait, Sancho, and I will do\nthem in the saying of a credo,\" and pulling off his breeches in all haste\nhe stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without more\nado, he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults,\nheels over head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time,\nSancho wheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his mind\nthat he could swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him\nto follow his road until his return, which was a quick one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THE\nPART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENA\n\n\nReturning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when he\nfound himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had completed\nthe performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the waist down\nand clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off without\nwaiting to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to the top of a high\nrock, and there set himself to consider what he had several times before\nconsidered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namely\nwhether it would be better and more to his purpose to imitate the\noutrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madness of Amadis; and\ncommuning with himself he said:\n\n\"What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant as\neveryone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobody could\nkill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot, and\nhe always wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunning devices did\nnot avail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all about them, and\nstrangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting the question of\nhis valour aside, let us come to his losing his wits, for certain it is\nthat he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at the\nfountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of Angelica having\nslept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, and\npage to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this was true, and that his\nlady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he should have gone mad; but\nI, how am I to imitate him in his madness, unless I can imitate him in\nthe cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will venture to swear, never saw a\nMoor in her life, as he is, in his proper costume, and she is this day as\nthe mother that bore her, and I should plainly be doing her a wrong if,\nfancying anything else, I were to go mad with the same kind of madness as\nRoland the Furious. On the other hand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without\nlosing his senses and without doing anything mad, acquired as a lover as\nmuch fame as the most famous; for, according to his history, on finding\nhimself rejected by his lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear in\nher presence until it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire to\nthe Pena Pobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill of\nweeping until Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and\nneed. And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to\nstrip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no\nharm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will\ngive me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadis\nand let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La\nMancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he did\nnot achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not\nrepulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said,\nto be absent from her. And so, now to business; come to my memory ye\ndeeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know\nalready that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to God;\nbut what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got one?\"\n\nAnd then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by\ntearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and\nmaking eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him\nfor a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated\ncountless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having\nanother hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and so\nhe solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing\nand carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of\nverses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea;\nbut, when he was found there afterwards, the only ones completely legible\nthat could be discovered were those that follow here:\n\nYe on the mountain side that grow,\n  Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,\nAre ye aweary of the woe\n  That this poor aching bosom crushes?\nIf it disturb you, and I owe\n    Some reparation, it may be a\nDefence for me to let you know\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\n    And all for distant Dulcinea\n                         Del Toboso.\n\nThe lealest lover time can show,\n  Doomed for a lady-love to languish,\nAmong these solitudes doth go,\n  A prey to every kind of anguish.\nWhy Love should like a spiteful foe\n  Thus use him, he hath no idea,\nBut hogsheads full--this doth he know--\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\n    And all for distant Dulcinea\n                       Del Toboso.\n\nAdventure-seeking doth he go\n  Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys,\nBut hill or dale, or high or low,\n  Mishap attendeth all his sallies:\nLove still pursues him to and fro,\n  And plies his cruel scourge--ah me! a\nRelentless fate, an endless woe;\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\n    And all for distant Dulcinea\n                       Del Toboso.\n\nThe addition of \"Del Toboso\" to Dulcinea's name gave rise to no little\nlaughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don\nQuixote must have fancied that unless he added \"del Toboso\" when he\nintroduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which\nwas indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote many\nmore, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that could be\nplainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing and calling\non the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, and\nEcho, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as in\nlooking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until Sancho's\nreturn; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, the\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such an altered\ncountenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him: and\nhere it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs and verses, to\nrelate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.\n\nAs for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and the\nnext day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen\nhim. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living\nthrough the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was\nan hour when he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he\nlonged to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for\nmany days past. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still\nundecided whether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came\nout two persons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other:\n\n\"Senor licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our\nadventurer's housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said the licentiate, \"and that is our friend Don Quixote's\nhorse;\" and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate\nand the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the\nscrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised\nSancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, they\napproached, and calling him by his name the curate said, \"Friend Sancho\nPanza, where is your master?\"\n\nSancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place\nand circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he\nreplied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain\nmatter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the\neyes in his head.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the barber, \"if you don't tell us where he is, Sancho\nPanza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and\nrobbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must\nproduce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\"\n\n\"There is no need of threats with me,\" said Sancho, \"for I am not a man\nto rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill\neach one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in\nthe midst of these mountains;\" and then, offhand and without stopping, he\ntold them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how\nhe was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of\nLorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were\nboth amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of\nDon Quixote's madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it\nthey were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show\nthem the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said\nit was written in a note-book, and that his master's directions were that\nhe should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On\nthis the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair\ncopy of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the note-book\nbut could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he\nhave found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to\nhim, nor had he himself thought of asking for it. When Sancho discovered\nhe could not find the book his face grew deadly pale, and in great haste\nhe again felt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be\nfound, without more ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked\naway half of it, and then, as quick as he could and without stopping,\ngave himself half a dozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were\nbathed in blood.\n\nSeeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him\nthat he gave himself such rough treatment.\n\n\"What should happen me?\" replied Sancho, \"but to have lost from one hand\nto the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a castle?\"\n\n\"How is that?\" said the barber.\n\n\"I have lost the note-book,\" said Sancho, \"that contained the letter to\nDulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his niece\nto give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;\" and he\nthen told them about the loss of Dapple.\n\nThe curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found he\nwould get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as was\nusual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never accepted or\nhonoured.\n\nSancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss of\nDulcinea's letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by\nheart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they\nliked.\n\n\"Repeat it then, Sancho,\" said the barber, \"and we will write it down\nafterwards.\"\n\nSancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to his\nmemory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one moment\nstaring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having half gnawed\noff the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him to\nbegin, he said, after a long pause, \"By God, senor licentiate, devil a\nthing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning,\n'Exalted and scrubbing Lady.'\"\n\n\"It cannot have said 'scrubbing,'\" said the barber, \"but 'superhuman' or\n'sovereign.'\"\n\n\"That is it,\" said Sancho; \"then, as well as I remember, it went on, 'The\nwounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your worship's\nhands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said something\nor other about health and sickness that he was sending her; and from that\nit went tailing off until it ended with 'Yours till death, the Knight of\nthe Rueful Countenance.\"\n\nIt gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memory\nSancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and begged him to\nrepeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it\nby heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times, and\nas he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them\nmore about his master but he never said a word about the blanketing that\nhad befallen himself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. He told\nthem, moreover, how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from\nthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put himself in the way of\nendeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been\nso settled between them, and with his personal worth and the might of his\narm it was an easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his\nlord was to make a marriage for him (for he would be a widower by that\ntime, as a matter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the\ndamsels of the empress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the\nmainland, having nothing to do with islands of any sort, for he did not\ncare for them now. All this Sancho delivered with so much\ncomposure--wiping his nose from time to time--and with so little\ncommon-sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder at the\nforce of Don Quixote's madness that could run away with this poor man's\nreason. They did not care to take the trouble of disabusing him of his\nerror, as they considered that since it did not in any way hurt his\nconscience it would be better to leave him in it, and they would have all\nthe more amusement in listening to his simplicities; and so they bade him\npray to God for his lord's health, as it was a very likely and a very\nfeasible thing for him in course of time to come to be an emperor, as he\nsaid, or at least an archbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank.\n\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"If fortune, sirs, should bring things about\nin such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being an\nemperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what\narchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?\"\n\n\"They commonly give them,\" said the curate, some simple benefice or cure,\nor some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, not\ncounting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.\"\n\n\"But for that,\" said Sancho, \"the squire must be unmarried, and must\nknow, at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for\nI am married already and I don't know the first letter of the A B C. What\nwill become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not\nan emperor, as is usual and customary with knights-errant?\"\n\n\"Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,\" said the barber, \"for we will entreat\nyour master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of\nconscience, to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will\nbe easier for him as he is more valiant than lettered.\"\n\n\"So I have thought,\" said Sancho; \"though I can tell you he is fit for\nanything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to place\nhim where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow most\nfavours upon me.\"\n\n\"You speak like a man of sense,\" said the curate, \"and you will be acting\nlike a good Christian; but what must now be done is to take steps to coax\nyour master out of that useless penance you say he is performing; and we\nhad best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to\ndine, for it is now time.\"\n\nSancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, and\nthat he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, and\nwhy it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him out\nsomething to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley for\nRocinante. They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought\nhim out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them\ncarefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the\ncurate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and\neffect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber,\nwas that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel,\nwhile the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and\nthat they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he,\npretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour\nof him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant;\nand the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her\nwhither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked\nknight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to\nrequire her to remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her\ncircumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight. And he had\nno doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any request made in these\nterms, and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own\nvillage, where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary\nmadness admitted of any kind of remedy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nOF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY\n\n\nThe curate's plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the\ncontrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution.\nThey begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her in pledge a\nnew cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a beard out of a\ngrey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb.\nThe landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the curate\ntold her in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and how this\ndisguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then\nwas. The landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that\nthe madman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed\nsquire, and they told the curate all that had passed between him and\nthem, not omitting what Sancho had been so silent about. Finally the\nlandlady dressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be\ndesired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a\npalm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a\nbinding of white satin, which as well as the petticoat must have been\nmade in the time of king Wamba. The curate would not let them hood him,\nbut put on his head a little quilted linen cap which he used for a\nnight-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip of black silk, while with\nanother he made a mask with which he concealed his beard and face very\nwell. He then put on his hat, which was broad enough to serve him for an\numbrella, and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself\nwoman-fashion on his mule, while the barber mounted his with a beard down\nto the waist of mingled red and white, for it was, as has been said, the\ntail of a clay-red ox.\n\nThey took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she\nwas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them\nsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in\nhand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the\ncurate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as\nit was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even\nthough much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged\nhim to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed\ndamsel, while he himself would play the squire's part, which would be\nless derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing\nmore to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at\nthis moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he\nwas unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as\nthe curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to\ninstruct him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to\ninduce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the\nplace he had chosen for his idle penance. The barber told him he could\nmanage it properly without any instruction, and as he did not care to\ndress himself up until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up\nthe garments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under\nthe guidance of Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of the\nencounter with the madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing,\nhowever, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all\nhis simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous.\n\nThe next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the\nbroom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,\nand recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that they\nwould do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver his\nmaster; for they had already told him that going in this guise and\ndressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue\nhis master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged him\nstrictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew them, and\nshould he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to Dulcinea,\nto say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she had\ngiven an answer by word of mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain\nof her displeasure, to come and see her at once; and it was a very\nimportant matter for himself, because in this way and with what they\nmeant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode\nof life and inducing him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or\nmonarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an archbishop. All this\nSancho listened to and fixed it well in his memory, and thanked them\nheartily for intending to recommend his master to be an emperor instead\nof an archbishop, for he felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards\non their squires emperors could do more than archbishops-errant. He said,\ntoo, that it would be as well for him to go on before them to find him,\nand give him his lady's answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring\nhim away from the place without putting them to all this trouble. They\napproved of what Sancho proposed, and resolved to wait for him until he\nbrought back word of having found his master.\n\nSancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one\nthrough which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks\nand trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with\nall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the hour\nwas three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more inviting and\ntempted them to wait there for Sancho's return, which they did. They were\nreposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of\nany instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone, reached their ears,\nat which they were not a little astonished, as the place did not seem to\nthem likely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often\nsaid that shepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and\nfields, this is rather a flight of the poet's fancy than the truth. And\nstill more surprised were they when they perceived that what they heard\nsung were the verses not of rustic shepherds, but of the polished wits of\nthe city; and so it proved, for the verses they heard were these:\n\nWhat makes my quest of happiness seem vain?\n    Disdain.\nWhat bids me to abandon hope of ease?\n    Jealousies.\nWhat holds my heart in anguish of suspense?\n    Absence.\n  If that be so, then for my grief\n  Where shall I turn to seek relief,\n  When hope on every side lies slain\n  By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?\n\nWhat the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?\n    Love.\nWhat at my glory ever looks askance?\n    Chance.\nWhence is permission to afflict me given?\n    Heaven.\n  If that be so, I but await\n  The stroke of a resistless fate,\n  Since, working for my woe, these three,\n  Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.\n\nWhat must I do to find a remedy?\n    Die.\nWhat is the lure for love when coy and strange?\n    Change.\nWhat, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?\n    Madness.\n  If that be so, it is but folly\n  To seek a cure for melancholy:\n  Ask where it lies; the answer saith\n  In Change, in Madness, or in Death.\n\nThe hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of\nthe singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two\nlisteners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,\nhowever, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to go\nin search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as they\nwere about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which once more\nfell upon their ears, singing this\n\nSONNET\n\nWhen heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go\n  Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,\n  And take thy seat among the saints on high,\nIt was thy will to leave on earth below\nThy semblance, and upon it to bestow\n  Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,\n  Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye,\nAnd makes its vileness bright as virtue show.\nFriendship, return to us, or force the cheat\n  That wears it now, thy livery to restore,\n    By aid whereof sincerity is slain.\nIf thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,\n  This earth will be the prey of strife once more,\n    As when primaeval discord held its reign.\n\nThe song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained waiting\nattentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the music had\nnow turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to find out\nwho the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs were\npiteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of a\nrock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as Sancho\nhad described to them when he told them the story of Cardenio. He,\nshowing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still with his head bent\ndown upon his breast like one in deep thought, without raising his eyes\nto look at them after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him.\nThe curate, who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the\ndescription, being a man of good address, approached him and in a few\nsensible words entreated and urged him to quit a life of such misery,\nlest he should end it there, which would be the greatest of all\nmisfortunes. Cardenio was then in his right mind, free from any attack of\nthat madness which so frequently carried him away, and seeing them\ndressed in a fashion so unusual among the frequenters of those wilds,\ncould not help showing some surprise, especially when he heard them speak\nof his case as if it were a well-known matter (for the curate's words\ngave him to understand as much) so he replied to them thus:\n\n\"I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is\nto succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this remote\nspot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve it not,\nthose who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat, showing\nme by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I act in leading the\nlife I do; but as they know, that if I escape from this evil I shall fall\ninto another still greater, perhaps they will set me down as a\nweak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of reason; nor would it be\nany wonder, for I myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection\nof my misfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin, that in\nspite of myself I become at times like a stone, without feeling or\nconsciousness; and I come to feel the truth of it when they tell me and\nshow me proofs of the things I have done when the terrible fit\novermasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot in vain, and idly curse\nmy destiny, and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused, to any\nthat care to hear it; for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will\nwonder at the effects; and if they cannot help me at least they will not\nblame me, and the repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into\npity for my woes. If it be, sirs, that you are here with the same design\nas others have come wah, before you proceed with your wise arguments, I\nentreat you to hear the story of my countless misfortunes, for perhaps\nwhen you have heard it you will spare yourselves the trouble you would\ntake in offering consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\"\n\nAs they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own\nlips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it, promising\nnot to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; and\nthereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the same\nwords and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and the\ngoatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don\nQuixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale was\nleft unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now\nfortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end; and\nso, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found in\nthe volume of \"Amadis of Gaul,\" Cardenio said that he remembered it\nperfectly and that it was in these words:\n\n\"Luscinda to Cardenio.\n\n\"Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold you\nin higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation\nwithout cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a father who\nknows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on my\ninclination will grant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be\nthat you value me as you say and as I believe you do.\"\n\n\"By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my\nwife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don\nFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and\nthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine\ncould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's\nfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did\nnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;\nnot because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,\nand beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour\nto any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me\nto marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me. In\nshort, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as well\non account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me\nthough I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me that\nwhat I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando\nanswered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and\npersuade him to speak to Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel\nCatiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous Vellido!\nO, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and\nperfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his fidelity, who with\nsuch frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys of his heart? What\noffence did I commit? What words did I utter, or what counsels did I give\nthat had not the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim?\nBut, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? for sure it is that when\nmisfortunes spring from the stars, descending from on high they fall upon\nus with such fury and violence that no power on earth can check their\ncourse nor human device stay their coming. Who could have thought that\nDon Fernando, a highborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me by gratitude\nfor my services, one that could win the object of his love wherever he\nmight set his affections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as\nto rob me of my one ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession? But\nlaying aside these useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the\nbroken thread of my unhappy story.\n\n\"To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the\nexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to\nhis elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for\nsix horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me away\nthat he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had purchased\nthe very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price of which he\nnow desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this treachery? Could I\nby any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from that, I offered with\nthe greatest pleasure to go at once, in my satisfaction at the good\nbargain that had been made. That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told\nher what had been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong\nhopes of our fair and reasonable wishes being realised. She, as\nunsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to\nreturn speedily, as she believed the fulfilment of our desires would be\ndelayed only so long as my father put off speaking to hers. I know not\nwhy it was that on saying this to me her eyes filled with tears, and\nthere came a lump in her throat that prevented her from uttering a word\nof many more that it seemed to me she was striving to say to me. I was\nastonished at this unusual turn, which I never before observed in her.\nfor we always conversed, whenever good fortune and my ingenuity gave us\nthe chance, with the greatest gaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears,\nsighs, jealousies, doubts, or fears with our words; it was all on my part\na eulogy of my good fortune that Heaven should have given her to me for\nmy mistress; I glorified her beauty, I extolled her worth and her\nunderstanding; and she paid me back by praising in me what in her love\nfor me she thought worthy of praise; and besides we had a hundred\nthousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk\nabout, and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take, almost by force,\none of her fair white hands and carry it to my lips, as well as the\ncloseness of the low grating that separated us allowed me. But the night\nbefore the unhappy day of my departure she wept, she moaned, she sighed,\nand she withdrew leaving me filled with perplexity and amazement,\noverwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affecting signs of grief and\nsorrow in Luscinda; but not to dash my hopes I ascribed it all to the\ndepth of her love for me and the pain that separation gives those who\nlove tenderly. At last I took my departure, sad and dejected, my heart\nfilled with fancies and suspicions, but not knowing well what it was I\nsuspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad event and\nmisfortune that was awaiting me.\n\n\"I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don\nFernando's brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,\nfor he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in some\nplace where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his brother\nwrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all of which\nwas a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother had no want\nof money to enable him to despatch me at once.\n\n\"The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it,\nas it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separated\nfrom Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood I have\ndescribed to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I obeyed, though I\nfelt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But four days later there\ncame a man in quest of me with a letter which he gave me, and which by\nthe address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as the writing was hers. I\nopened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded that it must be something\nserious that had impelled her to write to me when at a distance, as she\nseldom did so when I was near. Before reading it I asked the man who it\nwas that had given it to him, and how long he had been upon the road; he\ntold me that as he happened to be passing through one of the streets of\nthe city at the hour of noon, a very beautiful lady called to him from a\nwindow, and with tears in her eyes said to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if\nyou are, as you seem to be, a Christian, for the love of God I entreat\nyou to have this letter despatched without a moment's delay to the place\nand person named in the address, all which is well known, and by this you\nwill render a great service to our Lord; and that you may be at no\ninconvenience in doing so take what is in this handkerchief;' and said\nhe, 'with this she threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which\nwere tied up a hundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here\ntogether with the letter I have given you. And then without waiting for\nany answer she left the window, though not before she saw me take the\nletter and the handkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would\ndo as she bade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I\nwould have in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was\nto you it was sent (for, senor, I know you very well), and also unable to\nresist that beautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else, but\nto come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the time\nwhen it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know, is\neighteen leagues.'\n\n\"All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, I\nhung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could scarcely\nstand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:\n\n\"'The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,\nhe has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your\nadvantage. I have to tell you, senor, that he has demanded me for a wife,\nand my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando's superiority\nover you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in two days hence the\nbetrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so privately that the\nonly witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few of the household.\nPicture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be urgent for you to\ncome; the issue of the affair will show you whether I love you or not.\nGod grant this may come to your hand before mine shall be forced to link\nitself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged.'\n\n\"Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set out\nat once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now saw\nclearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasure\nthat had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The exasperation I\nfelt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of losing the prize I had\nwon by so many years of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almost\nflying I reached home the same day, by the hour which served for speaking\nwith Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and left the mule on which I had\ncome at the house of the worthy man who had brought me the letter, and\nfortune was pleased to be for once so kind that I found Luscinda at the\ngrating that was the witness of our loves. She recognised me at once, and\nI her, but not as she ought to have recognised me, or I her. But who is\nthere in the world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the\nwavering mind and unstable nature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To\nproceed: as soon as Luscinda saw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my\nbridal dress, and the treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are\nwaiting for me in the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the\nwitnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal. Be not\ndistressed, my friend, but contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and\nif that cannot be prevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which\nwill prevent more deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and\ngiving thee a first proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.' I\nreplied to her distractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have\ntime to reply, 'May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou\nhast a dagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill\nmyself if fortune be against us.'\n\n\"I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that\nthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the\nnight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my\neyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house, nor\nwas I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was that I\nshould be present at what might take place on the occasion, I nerved\nmyself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the entrances and\noutlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret pervaded the\nhouse no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I found an\nopportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the\nhall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries,\nfrom between which I could, without being seen, see all that took place\nin the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart I suffered as I\nstood there--the thoughts that came to me--the reflections that passed\nthrough my mind? They were such as cannot be, nor were it well they\nshould be, told. Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall\nin his usual dress, without ornament of any kind; as groomsman he had\nwith him a cousin of Luscinda's and except the servants of the house\nthere was no one else in the chamber. Soon afterwards Luscinda came out\nfrom an antechamber, attended by her mother and two of her damsels,\narrayed and adorned as became her rank and beauty, and in full festival\nand ceremonial attire. My anxiety and distraction did not allow me to\nobserve or notice particularly what she wore; I could only perceive the\ncolours, which were crimson and white, and the glitter of the gems and\njewels on her head dress and apparel, surpassed by the rare beauty of her\nlovely auburn hair that vying with the precious stones and the light of\nthe four torches that stood in the hall shone with a brighter gleam than\nall. Oh memory, mortal foe of my peace! why bring before me now the\nincomparable beauty of that adored enemy of mine? Were it not better,\ncruel memory, to remind me and recall what she then did, that stirred by\na wrong so glaring I may seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid\nmyself of life? Be not weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my\nsorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and\nbriefly, for to me each incident seems to call for many words.\"\n\nTo this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening\nto him, but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly, being\nof a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention\nas the main story.\n\n\"To proceed, then,\" continued Cardenio: \"all being assembled in the hall,\nthe priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to\nperform the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Senora Luscinda,\ntake Senor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the\nholy Mother Church ordains?' I thrust my head and neck out from between\nthe tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to\nlisten to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her reply the sentence of death\nor the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at that moment to rush\nforward crying aloud, 'Luscinda, Luscinda! have a care what thou dost;\nremember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art mine and canst not be\nanother's; reflect that thy utterance of \"Yes\" and the end of my life\nwill come at the same instant. O, treacherous Don Fernando! robber of my\nglory, death of my life! What seekest thou? Remember that thou canst not\nas a Christian attain the object of thy wishes, for Luscinda is my bride,\nand I am her husband!' Fool that I am! now that I am far away, and out of\ndanger, I say I should have done what I did not do: now that I have\nallowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me, I curse the robber, on\nwhom I might have taken vengeance had I as much heart for it as I have\nfor bewailing my fate; in short, as I was then a coward and a fool,\nlittle wonder is it if I am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and\nmad.\n\n\"The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long time\nwithheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger to save\nher honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truth\non my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I will:' Don\nFernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood linked by a\nknot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then approached to\nembrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her heart, fell\nfainting in her mother's arms. It only remains now for me to tell you the\nstate I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw all my hopes\nmocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved falsehoods, and the\nrecovery of the prize I had that instant lost rendered impossible for\never. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it seemed, by Heaven, declared\nthe enemy of the earth that bore me, the air refusing me breath for my\nsighs, the water moisture for my tears; it was only the fire that\ngathered strength so that my whole frame glowed with rage and jealousy.\nThey were all thrown into confusion by Luscinda's fainting, and as her\nmother was unlacing her to give her air a sealed paper was discovered in\nher bosom which Don Fernando seized at once and began to read by the\nlight of one of the torches. As soon as he had read it he seated himself\nin a chair, leaning his cheek on his hand in the attitude of one deep in\nthought, without taking any part in the efforts that were being made to\nrecover his bride from her fainting fit.\n\n\"Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out regardless\nwhether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do some\nfrenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation\nof my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even\nin that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my fate, doubtless\nreserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so ordered it that\njust then I had enough and to spare of that reason which has since been\nwanting to me; and so, without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest\nenemies (which might have been easily taken, as all thought of me was so\nfar from their minds), I resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself\nto inflict the pain they deserved, perhaps with even greater severity\nthan I should have dealt out to them had I then slain them; for sudden\npain is soon over, but that which is protracted by tortures is ever\nslaying without ending life. In a word, I quitted the house and reached\nthat of the man with whom I had left my mule; I made him saddle it for\nme, mounted without bidding him farewell, and rode out of the city, like\nanother Lot, not daring to turn my head to look back upon it; and when I\nfound myself alone in the open country, screened by the darkness of the\nnight, and tempted by the stillness to give vent to my grief without\napprehension or fear of being heard or seen, then I broke silence and\nlifted up my voice in maledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if\nI could thus avenge the wrong they had done me. I called her cruel,\nungrateful, false, thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of\nmy enemy had blinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to\ntransfer it to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal.\nAnd yet, in the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I\nfound excuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the\nseclusion of her parents' house, trained and schooled to obey them\nalways, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they offered\nher for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and noble\nbirth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been thought\nout of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a suspicion\ninjurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said, had she\ndeclared I was her husband, they would have seen that in choosing me she\nhad not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her, for before Don\nFernando had made his offer, they themselves could not have desired, if\ntheir desires had been ruled by reason, a more eligible husband for their\ndaughter than I was; and she, before taking the last fatal step of giving\nher hand, might easily have said that I had already given her mine, for I\nshould have come forward to support any assertion of hers to that effect.\nIn short, I came to the conclusion that feeble love, little reflection,\ngreat ambition, and a craving for rank, had made her forget the words\nwith which she had deceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes\nand honourable passion.\n\n\"Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder of\nthe night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these\nmountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking any\npath or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not which side\nof the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in what direction\nthe most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that it was in this\nquarter, and I at once directed my course hither, intending to end my\nlife here; but as I was making my way among these crags, my mule dropped\ndead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to\nhave done with such a worthless burden as it bore in me. I was left on\nfoot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to help me or any thought of\nseeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on the ground, how long I know\nnot, after which I rose up free from hunger, and found beside me some\ngoatherds, who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need,\nfor they told me how they had found me, and how I had been uttering\nravings that showed plainly I had lost my reason; and since then I am\nconscious that I am not always in full possession of it, but at times so\nderanged and crazed that I do a thousand mad things, tearing my clothes,\ncrying aloud in these solitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the\ndear name of her who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in\nlamentation; and when I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and\nweary that I can scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow\nof a cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen\nand goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish\nme with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think\nI may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out of\nmy senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me,\nand make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they tell\nme when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the road, and\nthough they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force from the\nshepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do pass the\nwretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to bring it\nto a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the\nbeauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando;\nfor if it will do this without depriving me of life, I will turn my\nthoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have\nfull mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no power or strength to\nrelease my body from this strait in which I have of my own accord chosen\nto place it.\n\n\"Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one that\ncan be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not\ntrouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests\nas likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the\nmedicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not\ntake it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it is her\npleasure to be another's, when she is or should be mine, let it be mine\nto be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She by her\nfickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive to gratify\nher wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show generations to come\nthat I alone was deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have\na superabundance, for to them the impossibility of being consoled is\nitself a consolation, while to me it is the cause of greater sorrows and\nsufferings, for I think that even in death there will not be an end of\nthem.\"\n\nHere Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full of\nmisfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to address\nsome words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that reached his\near, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part of\nthis narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian, Cide\nHamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THE\nCURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA\n\n\nHappy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don\nQuixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his having\nformed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and\nrestore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of\nknight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light\nentertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of\nthe tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less\npleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which,\nresuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the\ncurate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by\na voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones:\n\n\"O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret\ngrave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? If\nthe solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe\nis me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these\nrocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven,\nthan that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for\ncounsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!\"\n\nAll this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as it\nseemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up to\nlook for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they\ndiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in\nthe dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to see\nas he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that flowed\npast. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them, being\nfully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they looked\nlike two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones\nof the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with\nsurprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to\nfollow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested; and so,\nfinding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a\nsign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock\nthat lay there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was\nabout. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to\nhis body with a white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of\nbrown cloth, and on his head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters\nturned up as far as the middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of\npure alabaster.\n\nAs soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a\ntowel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his\nface, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a\nbeauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:\n\n\"As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.\"\n\nThe youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to\nside there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of\nthe sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a\npeasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of\nthem had ever beheld, or even Cardenio's if they had not seen and known\nLuscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda\ncould compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her\nshoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all\nround beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form\nwas visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed\nlike bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven\nsnow among her locks; all which increased not only the admiration of the\nthree beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she was. With this object\nthey resolved to show themselves, and at the stir they made in getting\nupon their feet the fair damsel raised her head, and parting her hair\nfrom before her eyes with both hands, she looked to see who had made the\nnoise, and the instant she perceived them she started to her feet, and\nwithout waiting to put on her shoes or gather up her hair, hastily\nsnatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she had beside her, and,\nscared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight; but before she had gone\nsix paces she fell to the ground, her delicate feet being unable to bear\nthe roughness of the stones; seeing which, the three hastened towards\nher, and the curate addressing her first said:\n\n\"Stay, senora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only\ndesire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so\nheedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.\"\n\nTaken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They,\nhowever, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on to say:\n\n\"What your dress would hide, senora, is made known to us by your hair; a\nclear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your\nbeauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like these\nwhere we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your\ndistress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long as life\nlasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the\nsufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention. And so,\nsenora, or senor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that\nour appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or\nevil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you\nwill receive sympathy in your trouble.\"\n\nWhile the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if\nspell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word,\njust like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never\nseen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some\nfurther words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke silence\nand said:\n\n\"Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, and\nthe escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in\nfalsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of\nwhat, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out of courtesy\nthan for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank you, sirs, for\nthe offer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of\ncomplying with the request you have made of me; though I fear the account\nI shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as\ncompassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or\nany consolation to alleviate them. However, that my honour may not be\nleft a matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered me to\nbe a woman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things\nthat taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good\nname, I feel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I\ncould.\"\n\nAll this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any\nhesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not\nless charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as they again\nrepeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise, she\nwithout further pressing, first modestly covering her feet and gathering\nup her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her,\nand, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes, in a\nclear and steady voice began her story thus:\n\n\"In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which\nmakes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This nobleman\nhas two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his good\nqualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the\ntreachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this\nlord's vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had\nconferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to\ndesire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in which I\nfind myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not\nhaving been nobly born. It is true they are not so low that they have any\nreason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither are they so high as\nto remove from my mind the impression that my mishap comes of their\nhumble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without\nany taint of disreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty\nChristians, but so rich that by their wealth and free-handed way of life\nthey are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even\nby position; though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was\nhaving me for their daughter; and as they have no other child to make\ntheir heir, and are affectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged\ndaughters that ever parents indulged.\n\n\"I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old\nage, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishes\ncentred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth;\nand as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their\npossessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants; through\nmy hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped; the\noil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, the\nbeehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have,\nI had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with an\nassiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well\ndescribe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given the\nrequisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I\npassed in such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for\nyoung girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning\nwheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a\nwhile, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the\nharp, for experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and\nrelieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led in my parents'\nhouse and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not out of\nostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may see how,\nwithout any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy condition I have\ndescribed, to the misery I am in at present. The truth is, that while I\nwas leading this busy life, in a retirement that might compare with that\nof a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except the servants of the\nhouse (for when I went to Mass it was so early in the morning, and I was\nso closely attended by my mother and the women of the household, and so\nthickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes scarcely saw more ground than I\ntrod on), in spite of all this, the eyes of love, or idleness, more\nproperly speaking, that the lynx's cannot rival, discovered me, with the\nhelp of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for that is the name of the\nyounger son of the duke I told of.\"\n\nThe moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio\nchanged colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that\nthe curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad\nfits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but\nCardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the\npeasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was.\nShe, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her\nstory, went on to say:\n\n\"And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he was\nsmitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayed\nitself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will\npass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for\ndeclaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household, he gave and\noffered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or\na merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music;\nthe love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, were\ninnumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing more\npromises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only\ndid not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as if he had been\nmy mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield were done\nwith the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don\nFernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities\nwearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself\nso sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not\ndispleased at seeing my praises in his letters (for however ugly we women\nmay be, it seems to me it always pleases us to hear ourselves called\nbeautiful) but that my own sense of right was opposed to all this, as\nwell as the repeated advice of my parents, who now very plainly perceived\nDon Fernando's purpose, for he cared very little if all the world knew\nit. They told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to\nmy virtue and rectitude alone, and bade me consider the disparity between\nDon Fernando and myself, from which I might conclude that his intentions,\nwhatever he might say to the contrary, had for their aim his own pleasure\nrather than my advantage; and if I were at all desirous of opposing an\nobstacle to his unreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry\nme at once to anyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our\nown town, or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth\nand my good name, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer,\nand their sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don\nFernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success,\nhowever remote.\n\n\"All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had\napparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite--for that is the\nname I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to be,\nyou would not know of it now, because there would have been no occasion\nto tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were\ncontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of\nobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors\nto watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you\nshall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion\nthan a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my\nhonour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can\nconceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these\nprecautions, and in the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found\nhim standing before me, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my\neyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry,\nnor, I think, did he give me time to utter one, as he immediately\napproached me, and taking me in his arms (for, overwhelmed as I was, I\nwas powerless, I say, to help myself), he began to make such professions\nto me that I know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing\nthem up to seem so like truth; and the traitor contrived that his tears\nshould vouch for his words, and his sighs for his sincerity.\n\n\"I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such\nas this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestations\ntrue, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything more\nthan pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed\naway, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him with\nmore courage than I thought I could have possessed, 'If, as I am now in\nyour arms, senor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my\ndeliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the\nprejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say\nit, than it would be possible that what was should not have been; so\nthen, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by\nvirtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will see if you\nattempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am\nnot your slave; your nobility neither has nor should have any right to\ndishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I\nhave my self-respect as much as you, a lord and gentleman: with me your\nviolence will be to no purpose, your wealth will have no weight, your\nwords will have no power to deceive me, nor your sighs or tears to soften\nme: were I to see any of the things I speak of in him whom my parents\ngave me as a husband, his will should be mine, and mine should be bounded\nby his; and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were\nnot would willingly yield him what you, senor, would now obtain by force;\nand this I say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband\nshall ever win anything of me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal gentleman,\n'be the only scruple you feel, fairest Dorothea' (for that is the name of\nthis unhappy being), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let\nHeaven, from which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have\nhere, be witnesses of this pledge.'\"\n\nWhen Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh\nagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but he\nwas unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of what\nhe already all but knew, so he merely said:\n\n\"What! is Dorothea your name, senora? I have heard of another of the same\nname who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I may\ntell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your\ncompassion.\"\n\nDorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his strange and\nmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to\ntell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was\ncourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure\nthat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she\nendured already.\n\n\"I would not let the occasion pass, senora,\" replied Cardenio, \"of\ntelling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far\nthere has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know\nit.\"\n\n\"Be it as it may,\" replied Dorothea, \"what happened in my story was that\nDon Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a\nwitness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagant\noaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though before he had made\nan end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing,\nand think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a\npeasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him not to let my beauty,\nsuch as it was, blind him, for that was not enough to furnish an excuse\nfor his transgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me\nany kindness, it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the\nlevel my condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought\nhappiness, nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began\nwith.\n\n\"All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I\ncannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his\npurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about\ndifficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I argued\nthe matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall not be the\nfirst who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, nor\nwill Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind\nattachment, has led to mate himself below his rank. Then, since I am\nintroducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of the\nhonour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for me\nshould not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all,\nhis wife before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn, I can see\nthat, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall be\nleft dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those\nwho cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this position; for\nwhat arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my\nchamber without my consent?'\n\n\"All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; but\nthe oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears he\nshed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace, which,\naccompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered a\nheart even more free and coy than mine--these were the things that more\nthan all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin. I called\nmy waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earth besides\nthose in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated his oaths,\ninvoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones, called\ndown upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his\npromise, shed more tears, redoubled his sighs and pressed me closer in\nhis arms, from which he had never allowed me to escape; and so I was left\nby my maid, and ceased to be one, and he became a traitor and a perjured\nman.\n\n\"The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so\nquickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attained\nits object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure. I\nsay so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and by the\nadroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted him,\ngained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he told me,\nthough not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came, that I\nmight rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his\noaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and\nplaced it upon mine. He then took his departure and I was left, I know\nnot whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and\ntroubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had\nnot the spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the\ntreachery she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my\nchamber; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had\nbefallen me was for good or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as\nI was now his, he might see me on other nights in the same way, until it\nshould be his pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the\nfollowing night, he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch\na glimpse of him in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with\nwatching for one; although I knew he was in the town, and almost every\nday went out hunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how\nsad and dreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I\nbegan to doubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith\nof Don Fernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in\nreproof of her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was\nforced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my\ncountenance, not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so\nmelancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was\nsuddenly brought to an end, for the time came when all such\nconsiderations were disregarded, and there was no further question of\nhonour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known\nabroad. The reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town\nthat Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of\nrare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though\nnot so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a\nmatch; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the\nbetrothal some strange things had happened.\"\n\nCardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his shoulders,\nbit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of tears\nescaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story,\nbut went on in these words:\n\n\"This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck with\na chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I scarcely\nrestrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying aloud and\nproclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim;\nbut this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution I\nformed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to assume this\ndress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of the zagals, as\nthey are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of my\nmisfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I\nheard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for my boldness,\nand condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my purpose, offered\nto bear me company, as he said, to the end of the world. I at once packed\nup in a linen pillow-case a woman's dress, and some jewels and money to\nprovide for emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without letting\nmy treacherous maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied by\nmy servant and abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, but\nborne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent\nwhat I presumed to be already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to\ntell me with what conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in\ntwo days and a half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of\nLuscinda's parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I\nsought to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred\nat the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such\nnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the\nstreet. He said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with\nLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying 'Yes,'\nshe was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom\napproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found a\npaper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she\ncould not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was already Cardenio's,\nwho, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of\nthe same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only in\nobedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper made\nit clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal,\nand gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was\nconfirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes.\nOn seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled,\nslighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had recovered\nfrom her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been\nfound, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who were\npresent prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don Fernando went away\nat once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her prostration until the\nnext day, when she told her parents how she was really the bride of that\nCardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides that Cardenio, according to\nreport, had been present at the betrothal; and that upon seeing her\nbetrothed contrary to his expectation, he had quitted the city in\ndespair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the wrong Luscinda had\ndone him, and his intention of going where no one should ever see him\nagain. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city, and everyone spoke\nof it; especially when it became known that Luscinda was missing from her\nfather's house and from the city, for she was not to be found anywhere,\nto the distraction of her parents, who knew not what steps to take to\nrecover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I was better pleased\nnot to have found Don Fernando than to find him married, for it seemed to\nme that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case, and I\nthought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in the way of the\nsecond marriage, to lead him to recognise his obligations under the\nformer one, and reflect that as a Christian he was bound to consider his\nsoul above all human objects. All this passed through my mind, and I\nstrove to comfort myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distant\nhopes of cherishing that life that I now abhor.\n\n\"But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find\nDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great\nreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my age\nand of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who came\nwith me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing that cut me to\nthe heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was not\nenough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with whom I\nhad fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my\nconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my\nservant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me,\nand the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thickly\nwooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil calls\nup another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of\none still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant,\nuntil then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot,\nmoved more by his own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take\nadvantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him,\nand with little shame and less fear of God and respect for me, began to\nmake overtures to me; and finding that I replied to the effrontery of his\nproposals with justly severe language, he laid aside the entreaties which\nhe had employed at first, and began to use violence.\n\n\"But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions,\nso aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion I\npushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead or alive I\nknow not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror\nand fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any other thought\nor purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my father\nand those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know not\nhow many months since with this object I came here, where I met a\nherdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this\nSierra, and all this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to\nkeep always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly\nbetrayed me. But all my care and pains were unavailing, for my master\nmade the discovery that I was not a man, and harboured the same base\ndesigns as my servant; and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in\ncases of difficulty, and I had no precipice or ravine at hand down which\nto fling the master and cure his passion, as I had in the servant's case,\nI thought it a lesser evil to leave him and again conceal myself among\nthese crags, than make trial of my strength and argument with him. So, as\nI say, once more I went into hiding to seek for some place where I might\nwith sighs and tears implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant\nme help and strength to escape from it, or let me die among the\nsolitudes, leaving no trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers,\nhas furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED TO EXTRICATE OUR\nLOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF\n\n\n\"Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for yourselves\nnow whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the tears that\nflowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had indulged in\nthem more freely; and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you\nwill see that consolation is idle, as there is no possible remedy for it.\nAll I ask of you is, what you may easily and reasonably do, to show me\nwhere I may pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by\nthose who are in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear\nme makes me feel sure of being kindly received by them, so great is my\nfeeling of shame at the mere thought that I cannot present myself before\nthem as they expect, that I had rather banish myself from their sight for\never than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld mine\nstripped of that purity they had a right to expect in me.\"\n\nWith these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her\nface showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. In\ntheirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but\nas the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice\nCardenio forestalled him, saying, \"So then, senora, you are the fair\nDorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\" Dorothea was\nastonished at hearing her father's name, and at the miserable appearance\nof him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad\nCardenio was; so she said to him:\n\n\"And who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father's name so well?\nFor so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole\nstory of my misfortunes.\"\n\n\"I am that unhappy being, senora,\" replied Cardenio, \"whom, as you have\nsaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio,\nwhom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition\nhas reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human\ncomfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven\nis pleased for some short space to restore it to me. I, Dorothea, am he\nwho witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the\n'Yes' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed: I am he who\nhad not courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended, or what came of\nthe paper that was found in her bosom, because my heart had not the\nfortitude to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once; and so losing\npatience I quitted the house, and leaving a letter with my host, which I\nentreated him to place in Luscinda's hands, I betook myself to these\nsolitudes, resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal\nenemy. But fate would not rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me\nof my reason, perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in\nmeeting you; for if that which you have just told us be true, as I\nbelieve it to be, it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a\nhappier termination to our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing\nthat Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself\nso openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is\nyours, we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is\nours, as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And\nas we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild\nfancy, I entreat you, senora, to form new resolutions in your better\nmind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to\nhappier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a\nChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don\nFernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation\nto you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a\ngentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the\ninjury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave\nto Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\"\n\nCardenio's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing\nhow to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet;\nbut Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both,\ncommended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised,\nand urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish\nthemselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don\nFernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them\nmost advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind\noffer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all\nattentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with\nno less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that\nmight be of use to them. He also explained to them in a few words the\nobject that had brought them there, and the strange nature of Don\nQuixote's madness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gone\nin search of him. Like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he had\nhad with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio's memory, and he described it\nto the others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.\n\nAt this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from\nSancho Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling\naloud to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries\nabout Don Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his\nshirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady\nDulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit\nthat place and come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had\nanswered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her\nbeauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if\nthis went on, Sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as\nin duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he could be;\nfor which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get him\naway from there. The licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for\nthey would fetch him away in spite of himself. He then told Cardenio and\nDorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate\ntake him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could play the\ndistressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the\ndress in which to do it to the life, and that they might trust to her\nacting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their\nscheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly\nthe style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the curate, \"there is nothing more required than to\nset about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in\nour favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your\nrelief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.\"\n\nDorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some\nrich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a\nnecklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an\ninstant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich\nlady. All this, and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of\nneed, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it. They\nwere all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and declared\nDon Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected such\ncharms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it seemed\nto him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life he had\nnever seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with great\neagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted in these\nout-of-the-way quarters.\n\n\"This fair lady, brother Sancho,\" replied the curate, \"is no less a\npersonage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom\nof Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him,\nwhich is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has done\nher; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired\nfar and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.\"\n\n\"A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!\" said Sancho Panza at this;\n\"especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury, and\nright that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worship\nspeaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed, he\nhappens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against\nphantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, senor\nlicentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an\narchbishop, for that is what I'm afraid of, your worship would recommend\nhim to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled\nfrom taking archbishop's orders, and will easily come into his empire,\nand I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter\ncarefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do for me that\nmy master should become an archbishop, because I am no good for the\nChurch, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a wife and\nchildren, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a\nplace of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so that, senor,\nit all turns on my master marrying this lady at once--for as yet I do not\nknow her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.\"\n\n\"She is called the Princess Micomicona,\" said the curate; \"for as her\nkingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt of that,\" replied Sancho, \"for I have known many to\ntake their name and title from the place where they were born and call\nthemselves Pedro of Alcala, Juan of Ubeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and\nit may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking\nthe names of their kingdoms.\"\n\n\"So it may,\" said the curate; \"and as for your master's marrying, I will\ndo all in my power towards it:\" with which Sancho was as much pleased as\nthe curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the\nabsurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidently\npersuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.\n\nBy this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate's mule, and the\nbarber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told Sancho\nto conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say that he\nknew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master's becoming an\nemperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curate\nnor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; Cardenio lest he\nshould remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with him, and the curate\nas there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they allowed the\nothers to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly on\nfoot. The curate did not forget to instruct Dorothea how to act, but she\nsaid they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done\nexactly as the books of chivalry required and described.\n\nThey had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don\nQuixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his\narmour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that that\nwas Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber\nfollowing her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule\nand came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with\ngreat ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote;\nand though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him in\nthis fashion:\n\n\"From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your\ngoodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honour\nand renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate\nand afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong\narm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to aid\nthe helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath\ncome from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.\"\n\n\"I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,\" replied Don Quixote, \"nor\nwill I listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from the\nearth.\"\n\n\"I will not rise, senor,\" answered the afflicted damsel, \"unless of your\ncourtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.\"\n\n\"I grant and accord it,\" said Don Quixote, \"provided without detriment or\nprejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart\nand freedom, it may be complied with.\"\n\n\"It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy\nlord,\" said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to his\nmaster's ear and said to him very softly, \"Your worship may very safely\ngrant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big giant;\nand she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of the\ngreat kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.\"\n\n\"Let her be who she may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I will do what is my\nbounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I\nhave professed;\" and turning to the damsel he said, \"Let your great\nbeauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.\"\n\n\"Then what I ask,\" said the damsel, \"is that your magnanimous person\naccompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promise not\nto engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of a\ntraitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my kingdom.\"\n\n\"I repeat that I grant it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and so, lady, you may\nfrom this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and let\nyour failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help of God\nand of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, and\nseated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, notwithstanding\nand despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the\nwork, for in delay there is apt to be danger.\"\n\nThe distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but\nDon Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, would\nby no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with great\ncourtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante's\ngirths, and to arm him without a moment's delay. Sancho took down the\narmour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the\ngirths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in\nhis armour exclaimed:\n\n\"Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.\"\n\nThe barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his\nlaughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine\nscheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and\nthe promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in compliance\nwith it, he rose and took his lady's hand, and between them they placed\nher upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and the barber\nsettled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on foot, which made\nhim feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want of him now. But he\nbore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his master had now\nfairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he\nfelt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess, and be king of\nMicomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him was the reflection\nthat this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and that the people they\nwould give him for vassals would be all black; but for this he soon found\na remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself, \"What is it to me if my\nvassals are blacks? What more have I to do than make a cargo of them and\ncarry them to Spain, where I can sell them and get ready money for them,\nand with it buy some title or some office in which to live at ease all\nthe days of my life? Not unless you go to sleep and haven't the wit or\nskill to turn things to account and sell three, six, or ten thousand\nvassals while you would be talking about it! By God I will stir them up,\nbig and little, or as best I can, and let them be ever so black I'll turn\nthem into white or yellow. Come, come, what a fool I am!\" And so he\njogged on, so occupied with his thoughts and easy in his mind that he\nforgot all about the hardship of travelling on foot.\n\nCardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes,\nnot knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who was\nvery fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose,\nand with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off\nCardenio's beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him\na black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet, while\nCardenio's appearance was so different from what it had been that he\nwould not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having\neffected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were\ndisguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before them,\nfor the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those\non horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then posted themselves\non the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and as soon as Don\nQuixote and his companions emerged from it the curate began to examine\nhim very deliberately, as though he were striving to recognise him, and\nafter having stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with\nopen arms exclaiming, \"A happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my\nworthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower and cream of high\nbreeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence\nof knights-errant!\" And so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of Don\nQuixote's left leg. He, astonished at the stranger's words and behaviour,\nlooked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very much\nsurprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. This,\nhowever, the curate would not allow, on which Don Quixote said, \"Permit\nme, senor licentiate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horseback\nand so reverend a person as your worship on foot.\"\n\n\"On no account will I allow it,\" said the curate; \"your mightiness must\nremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest\ndeeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\nunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of\none of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if they\nhave no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed Pegasus, or\non the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, Muzaraque, who to this\nday lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a little distance from\nthe great Complutum.\"\n\n\"Nor even that will I consent to, senor licentiate,\" answered Don\nQuixote, \"and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the\nprincess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle\nof his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will bear\nit.\"\n\n\"It will, I am sure,\" said the princess, \"and I am sure, too, that I need\nnot order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to allow a\nChurchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.\"\n\n\"That he is,\" said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his\nsaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but\nunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\nhappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned,\nlifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, which\nwould have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in quest of Don\nQuixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head. As it\nwas, they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so\nlittle heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he\nfound himself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his\nhands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don Quixote when he saw\nall that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face\nof the fallen squire, exclaimed:\n\n\"By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and\nplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off\ndesignedly.\"\n\nThe curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, at\nonce pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master Nicholas\nlay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast had it on\nin an instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certain\nspecial charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as\nhe had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared well bearded and\nwhole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and\nbegged the curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as\nhe was persuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards,\nfor it was clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh\nmust have remained torn and lacerated, and when it could heal all that it\nmust be good for more than beards.\n\n\"And so it is,\" said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on\nthe first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate\nshould mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached\nthe inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.\n\nThree then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, and\nthe curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza,\nDon Quixote said to the damsel:\n\n\"Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;\"\nbut before she could answer the licentiate said:\n\n\"Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is it\nperchance towards that of Micomicon? It must be, or else I know little\nabout kingdoms.\"\n\nShe, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer \"Yes,\"\nso she said \"Yes, senor, my way lies towards that kingdom.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the curate, \"we must pass right through my village,\nand there your worship will take the road to Cartagena, where you will be\nable to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair and the sea\nsmooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you may come in\nsight of the great lake Meona, I mean Meotides, which is little more than\na hundred days' journey this side of your highness's kingdom.\"\n\n\"Your worship is mistaken, senor,\" said she; \"for it is not two years\nsince I set out from it, and though I never had good weather,\nnevertheless I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that is my\nlord Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as I\nset foot in Spain and impelled me to go in search of him, to commend\nmyself to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to the might\nof his invincible arm.\"\n\n\"Enough; no more praise,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"for I hate all\nflattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind is\noffensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, senora, that whether it has\nmight or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to your\nservice even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, I\nwould ask the senor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him\ninto these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled\nwith amazement.\"\n\n\"I will answer that briefly,\" replied the curate; \"you must know then,\nSenor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I\nwere going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who\nwent to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum\nbut that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which\nis something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by\nfour footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped\noff so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even\nthis young man here\"-pointing to Cardenio--\"they completely transformed.\nBut the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who\nattacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, they say, were set\nfree almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that, in spite\nof the commissary and of the guards, he released the whole of them; and\nbeyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses, or he must be as\ngreat a scoundrel as they, or some man without heart or conscience to let\nthe wolf loose among the sheep, the fox among the hens, the fly among the\nhoney. He has defrauded justice, and opposed his king and lawful master,\nfor he opposed his just commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of\ntheir feet, stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has\nbeen quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost\nwithout any gain to his body.\" Sancho had told the curate and the barber\nof the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his\nmaster had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most\nof it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed\ncolour at every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the\nliberator of those worthy people. \"These, then,\" said the curate, \"were\nthey who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not let\nthem go to the punishment they deserved.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHER\nMATTERS PLEASANT AND AMUSING\n\n\nThe curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, \"In faith, then,\nsenor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was not for\nwant of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was\nabout, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all on\nthe march there because they were special scoundrels.\"\n\n\"Blockhead!\" said Don Quixote at this, \"it is no business or concern of\nknights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains,\nor oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer\nas they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. It\nonly concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard\nto their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet\nor string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my\nsense of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and\nwhoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the senor\nlicentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry\nand lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the\nfullest extent with my sword;\" and so saying he settled himself in his\nstirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber's basin, which\naccording to him was Mambrino's helmet, he carried hanging at the\nsaddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley\nslaves.\n\nDorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly\nunderstood Don Quixote's crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza\nwere making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on\nobserving his irritation, \"Sir Knight, remember the boon you have\npromised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any\nother adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the\nlicentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that\nunconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even\nbitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that\ntended towards disrespect of your worship.\"\n\n\"That I swear heartily,\" said the curate, \"and I would have even plucked\noff a moustache.\"\n\n\"I will hold my peace, senora,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I will curb the\nnatural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and\nquietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this\nconsideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do\nso, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are\nthe persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to\ntake vengeance on your behalf?\"\n\n\"That I will do with all my heart,\" replied Dorothea, \"if it will not be\nwearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.\"\n\n\"It will not be wearisome, senora,\" said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea\nreplied, \"Well, if that be so, give me your attention.\" As soon as she\nsaid this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear\nwhat sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself;\nand Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his\nmaster; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and\nwith the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think,\nbegan with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.\n\n\"First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is-\" and here\nshe stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given\nher; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and said,\n\"It is no wonder, senora, that your highness should be confused and\nembarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such afflictions\noften have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that they\ndo not even remember their own names, as is the case now with your\nladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the Princess Micomicona,\nlawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with this cue your\nhighness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection all you may wish\nto tell us.\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" said the damsel; \"but I think from this on I shall\nhave no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into\nport, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the\nSapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware\nby his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die\nbefore he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and I\nwas to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he\ndeclared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge\nthat a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom,\nPandafilando of the Scowl by name--for it is averred that, though his\neyes are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he\nsquinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror\ninto those he looks at--that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming\naware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force\nand strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me;\nbut that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to\nmarry him; however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I\nwould consent to a marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the\ntruth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or\nany other, let him be ever so great or enormous. My father said, too,\nthat when he was dead, and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom,\nI was not to wait and attempt to defend myself, for that would be\ndestructive to me, but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to\nhim if I wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and\nloyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending myself\nagainst the giant's devilish power; and that I should at once with some\nof my followers set out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my\ndistress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would\nextend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember\nrightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.\"\n\n\"'Don Quixote,' he must have said, senora,\" observed Sancho at this,\n\"otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\n\"That is it,\" said Dorothea; \"he said, moreover, that he would be tall of\nstature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left\nshoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like\nbristles.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"Here, Sancho my son,\nbear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight\nthat sage king foretold.\"\n\n\"What does your worship want to strip for?\" said Dorothea.\n\n\"To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,\" answered Don Quixote.\n\n\"There is no occasion to strip,\" said Sancho; \"for I know your worship\nhas just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of\na strong man.\"\n\n\"That is enough,\" said Dorothea, \"for with friends we must not look too\nclosely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the\nbackbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it\nmay, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth\nin every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to\nDon Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his\ncountenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide\nfame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had\nscarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements,\nthat at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search\nof.\"\n\n\"But how did you land at Osuna, senora,\" asked Don Quixote, \"when it is\nnot a seaport?\"\n\nBut before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, \"The\nprincess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first place\nwhere she heard of your worship was Osuna.\"\n\n\"That is what I meant to say,\" said Dorothea.\n\n\"And that would be only natural,\" said the curate. \"Will your majesty\nplease proceed?\"\n\n\"There is no more to add,\" said Dorothea, \"save that in finding Don\nQuixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard\nmyself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy\nand magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me\nwhithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face to\nface with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and restore to\nme what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass\nsatisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, who\nlikewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek characters (for\nI cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut the\ngiant's throat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer myself at\nonce without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of my\nkingdom together with my person.\"\n\n\"What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?\" said Don Quixote at this.\n\"Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got a\nkingdom to govern and a queen to marry!\"\n\n\"On my oath it is so,\" said Sancho; \"and foul fortune to him who won't\nmarry after slitting Senor Pandahilado's windpipe! And then, how\nill-favoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!\"\n\nAnd so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of\nextreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea's\nmule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give\nhim her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen\nand mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see\nthe madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea\ntherefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her\nkingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and\nenjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all\nlaughing again.\n\n\"This, sirs,\" continued Dorothea, \"is my story; it only remains to tell\nyou that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have none\nleft except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a great\ntempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came to land\non a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of\nmy life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if I\nhave been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it\nbe accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale,\nthat constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their\nmemory.\"\n\n\"They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,\" said\nDon Quixote, \"however great and unexampled those which I shall endure in\nyour service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promised\nyou, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find\nmyself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust\nby the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this--I will not say\ngood sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine\"--(this he\nsaid between his teeth, and then continued), \"and when it has been cut\noff and you have been put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall\nbe left to your own decision to dispose of your person as may be most\npleasing to you; for so long as my memory is occupied, my will enslaved,\nand my understanding enthralled by her-I say no more--it is impossible\nfor me for a moment to contemplate marriage, even with a Phoenix.\"\n\nThe last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so\ndisagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great\nirritation:\n\n\"By my oath, Senor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for how\ncan your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as\nthis? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece\nof luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea fairer, perchance? Not\nshe; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she does not\ncome up to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have of getting\nthat county I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in\nthe bottom of the sea. In the devil's name, marry, marry, and take this\nkingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king\nmake me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the\ndevil take it all.\"\n\nDon Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady\nDulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying\nanything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks that\nhe brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried out\nto him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot.\n\n\"Do you think,\" he said to him after a pause, \"you scurvy clown, that you\nare to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always\noffending and I always pardoning? Don't fancy it, impious scoundrel, for\nthat beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going\nagainst the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that\nwere it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should not have\nstrength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper's tongue, what\nthink you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant's head and made you\na marquis (for all this I count as already accomplished and decided), but\nthe might of Dulcinea, employing my arm as the instrument of her\nachievements? She fights in me and conquers in me, and I live and breathe\nin her, and owe my life and being to her. O whoreson scoundrel, how\nungrateful you are, you see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to\nbe a titled lord, and the return you make for so great a benefit is to\nspeak evil of her who has conferred it upon you!\"\n\nSancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and\nrising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind\nDorothea's palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:\n\n\"Tell me, senor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great\nprincess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so,\nhow can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let your\nworship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as if\nshowered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my lady\nDulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept\nmistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the truth\nis to be told, I like them both; though I have never seen the lady\nDulcinea.\"\n\n\"How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"hast\nthou not just now brought me a message from her?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Sancho, \"that I did not see her so much at my leisure that\nI could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal;\nbut taken in the lump I like her.\"\n\n\"Now I forgive thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and do thou forgive me the\ninjury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our control.\"\n\n\"That I see,\" replied Sancho, \"and with me the wish to speak is always\nthe first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I\nhave on the tip of my tongue.\"\n\n\"For all that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"take heed of what thou sayest,\nfor the pitcher goes so often to the well--I need say no more to thee.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Sancho, \"God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and\nwill judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship\nin not doing it.\"\n\n\"That is enough,\" said Dorothea; \"run, Sancho, and kiss your lord's hand\nand beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your praise\nand abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom\nI know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, for\nyou will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.\"\n\nSancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which Don\nQuixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as\nhe had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had\nquestions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him.\nSancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in advance Don\nQuixote said to him, \"Since thy return I have had no opportunity or time\nto ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou\nhast brought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and\nopportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good\nnews.\"\n\n\"Let your worship ask what you will,\" answered Sancho, \"for I shall find\na way out of all as as I found a way in; but I implore you, senor, not\nnot to be so revengeful in future.\"\n\n\"Why dost thou say that, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I say it,\" he returned, \"because those blows just now were more because\nof the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night, than\nfor what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as I\nwould a relic--though there is nothing of that about her--merely as\nsomething belonging to your worship.\"\n\n\"Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"for it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that, and\nthou knowest the common saying, 'for a fresh sin a fresh penance.'\"\n\nWhile this was going on they saw coming along the road they were\nfollowing a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be a\ngipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw\nasses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de\nPasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass,\nfor it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape\nrecognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being\nable to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they were\nhis own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did so he\nshouted to him, \"Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure, release my\nlife, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my\ndelight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what is not\nthine.\"\n\nThere was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the\nfirst one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got\nclear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him he\nsaid, \"How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?\"\nall the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being.\nThe ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by Sancho\nwithout answering a single word. They all came up and congratulated him\non having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that\nnotwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for the three\nass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.\n\nWhile the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate\nobserved to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in the\nstory itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those\nof the books of chivalry. She said that she had many times amused herself\nreading them; but that she did not know the situation of the provinces or\nseaports, and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.\n\n\"So I saw,\" said the curate, \"and for that reason I made haste to say\nwhat I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange thing\nto see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and\nlies, simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities\nof his books?\"\n\n\"So it is,\" said Cardenio; \"and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one\nto attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be any\nwit keen enough to imagine it.\"\n\n\"But another strange thing about it,\" said the curate, \"is that, apart\nfrom the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with\nhis craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in a\nperfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and\ncomposed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no one\nwould take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound\nunderstanding.\"\n\nWhile they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his with\nSancho, saying:\n\n\"Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me\nnow, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou\nfind Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did\nshe answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied\nit out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth\nknowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give me\npleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out\nthe letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.\"\n\n\"It is as thou sayest,\" said Don Quixote, \"for the note-book in which I\nwrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which\ngave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on\nfinding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return\nfrom the place where thou didst first miss it.\"\n\n\"So I should have done,\" said Sancho, \"if I had not got it by heart when\nyour worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan, who\ncopied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all the\ndays of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he\nhad never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.\"\n\n\"And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"No, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing\nthere was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I\nrecollect any of it, it is that about 'Scrubbing,'I mean to say\n'Sovereign Lady,' and the end 'Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance;' and between these two I put into it more than three hundred\n'my souls' and 'my life's' and 'my eyes.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nOF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA, HIS\nSQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS\n\n\n\"All that is not unsatisfactory to me,\" said Don Quixote. \"Go on; thou\ndidst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou\ndidst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold\nthread for this her enslaved knight.\"\n\n\"I did not,\" said Sancho, \"but I found her winnowing two bushels of wheat\nin the yard of her house.\"\n\n\"Then depend upon it,\" said Don Quixote, \"the grains of that wheat were\npearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it\nwhite wheat or brown?\"\n\n\"It was neither, but red,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Then I promise thee,\" said Don Quixote, \"that, winnowed by her hands,\nbeyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thou\ngavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her head? Did\nshe perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?\"\n\n\"When I went to give it to her,\" replied Sancho, \"she was hard at it\nswaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and\nshe said to me, 'Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I\ncannot read it until I have done sifting all this.\"\n\n\"Discreet lady!\" said Don Quixote; \"that was in order to read it at her\nleisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her\noccupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about\nme, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let not\nan atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.\"\n\n\"She asked me nothing,\" said Sancho; \"but I told her how your worship was\nleft doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among\nthese mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating bread\noff a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your\nfortune.\"\n\n\"In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,\" said Don Quixote; \"for\nrather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for\nhaving made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea del\nToboso.\"\n\n\"And so lofty she is,\" said Sancho, \"that she overtops me by more than a\nhand's-breadth.\"\n\n\"What! Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"didst thou measure with her?\"\n\n\"I measured in this way,\" said Sancho; \"going to help her to put a sack\nof wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could\nsee she stood more than a good palm over me.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Don Quixote, \"and doth she not of a truth accompany and\nadorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one\nthing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst\nthou not perceive a Sabaean odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not\nwhat, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an\nexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?\"\n\n\"All I can say is,\" said Sancho, \"that I did perceive a little odour,\nsomething goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard\nwork.\"\n\n\"It could not be that,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must have been\nsuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know\nwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of the\nfield, that dissolved amber.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Sancho; \"there often comes from myself that same\nodour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;\nbut that's no wonder, for one devil is like another.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" continued Don Quixote, \"now she has done sifting the corn\nand sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?\"\n\n\"As for the letter,\" said Sancho, \"she did not read it, for she said she\ncould neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into small\npieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her\nsecrets should become known in the village, and that what I had told her\nby word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the\nextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to\nmake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your\nhands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you;\nand that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of this\npresent, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with carrying on\nabsurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless something else\nof greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire to see\nyour worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was\ncalled The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan\nthe other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an\nhonest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she\nhad not seen any as yet.\"\n\n\"So far all goes well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me what jewel was it\nthat she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me?\nFor it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to\ngive the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to\nthe knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a\nguerdon for good news,' and acknowledgment of the message.\"\n\n\"That is very likely,\" said Sancho, \"and a good custom it was, to my\nmind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to\nbe the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was\nwhat my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took\nleave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese.\"\n\n\"She is generous in the extreme,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if she did not\ngive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not\none to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I\nshall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes\nme, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air,\nfor thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso\nand return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there.\nFrom which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my\nfriend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is and must\nbe one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that this same, I\nsay, must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of\nthese sages will catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his bed, and\nwithout his knowing how or in what way it happened, he wakes up the next\nday more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to\nsleep. And if it were not for this, knights-errant would not be able to\ngive aid to one another in peril, as they do at every turn. For a knight,\nmaybe, is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or\nfierce serpent, or another knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and\nis at the point of death; but when he least looks for it, there appears\nover against him on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend\nof his, who just before had been in England, and who takes his part, and\ndelivers him from death; and at night he finds himself in his own\nquarters supping very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to\nthe other will have been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is\ndone by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those\nvaliant knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in\nbelieving that thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and\nreturned in such a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage\nmust have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.\"\n\n\"That must have been it,\" said Sancho, \"for indeed Rocinante went like a\ngipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears.\"\n\n\"Quicksilver!\" said Don Quixote, \"aye and what is more, a legion of\ndevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary,\nexactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkest\nthou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her? For though\nI feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that I am debarred\nby the boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the\nlaw of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my\ninclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and\nharasses me, on the other my solemn promise and the glory I shall win in\nthis enterprise urge and call me; but what I think I shall do is to\ntravel with all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is,\nand on my arrival I shall cut off his head, and establish the princess\npeacefully in her realm, and forthwith I shall return to behold the light\nthat lightens my senses, to whom I shall make such excuses that she will\nbe led to approve of my delay, for she will see that it entirely tends to\nincrease her glory and fame; for all that I have won, am winning, or\nshall win by arms in this life, comes to me of the favour she extends to\nme, and because I am hers.\"\n\n\"Ah! what a sad state your worship's brains are in!\" said Sancho. \"Tell\nme, senor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let\nslip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\nportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than\ntwenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things\nnecessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and Castile\nput together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you have said,\nand take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the first\nvillage where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will\ndo the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice,\nand this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand\nis better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand\nand chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.\"\n\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"If thou art advising me to marry,\nin order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be\nable to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let\nme tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without\nmarrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that,\nif I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a\nportion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I\nchoose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow\nit but upon thee?\"\n\n\"That is plain speaking,\" said Sancho; \"but let your worship take care to\nchoose it on the seacoast, so that if I don't like the life, I may be\nable to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;\ndon't mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant\nand let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be\none of great honour and great profit.\"\n\n\"I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I\nwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see\nDulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to any one, or to those\nwho are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as\nDulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known\nit is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\"\n\n\"Well then, if that be so,\" said Sancho, \"how is it that your worship\nmakes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before\nmy lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it\nthat you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must perforce\nkneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves\nto her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?\"\n\n\"O, how silly and simple thou art!\" said Don Quixote; \"seest thou not,\nSancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know\nthat according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour to\na lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never\ngo beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other reward\nfor their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to\naccept them as her knights.\"\n\n\"It is with that kind of love,\" said Sancho, \"I have heard preachers say\nwe ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved by the\nhope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I would\nrather love and serve him for what he could do.\"\n\n\"The devil take thee for a clown!\" said Don Quixote, \"and what shrewd\nthings thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.\"\n\n\"In faith, then, I cannot even read.\"\n\nMaster Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted\nto halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew\nup, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time\nweary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him\ntripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El\nToboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on\nthe clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though\nthey were not very good, they were far better than those he put off. They\ndismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the curate\nhad provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well,\nthe keen appetite they all of them brought with them.\n\nWhile they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on\nhis way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next moment\nran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to weep freely,\nsaying, \"O, senor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I am that lad\nAndres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I was tied.\"\n\nDon Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those\npresent and said: \"That your worships may see how important it is to have\nknights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and\nwicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passing\nthrough a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in\npain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden duty,\nto the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and\nI found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my\nheart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit me to depart from\nthe truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from\nthe waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, was\nscarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare. As soon as I saw him\nI asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that he\nwas flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness\nthat proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy\nsaid, 'Senor, he flogs me only because I ask for my wages.' The master\nmade I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listened\nto them, I did not accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him,\nand to swear he would take him with him, and pay him real by real, and\nperfumed into the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst\nthou not mark with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility\nhe promised to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer\nwithout hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may\nsee that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant\nabroad.\"\n\n\"All that your worship has said is quite true,\" answered the lad; \"but\nthe end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship\nsupposes.\"\n\n\"How! the opposite?\" said Don Quixote; \"did not the clown pay thee then?\"\n\n\"Not only did he not pay me,\" replied the lad, \"but as soon as your\nworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up again\nto the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a flayed\nSaint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some\njest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and but for the\npain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he said. In\nshort he left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a\nhospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown\ninflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you\nhad gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you, nor\nmeddled in other people's affairs, my master would have been content with\ngiving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid\nme what he owed me; but when your worship abused him so out of measure,\nand gave him so many hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could\nnot revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm\nburst upon me in such a way, that I feel as if I should never be a man\nagain.\"\n\n\"The mischief,\" said Don Quixote, \"lay in my going away; for I should not\nhave gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known well\nby long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if he\nfinds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, Andres, that\nI swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him, and find him\nthough he were to hide himself in the whale's belly.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but it was of no use.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\" said Don Quixote; and\nso saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was\nbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to do.\nHe replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him\nfor such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi,\ndespite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To which she\nreplied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he\ncould not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that\nas he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain his ardour until\nhis return from her kingdom.\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and Andres must have patience until my\nreturn as you say, senora; but I once more swear and promise not to stop\nuntil I have seen him avenged and paid.\"\n\n\"I have no faith in those oaths,\" said Andres; \"I would rather have now\nsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the\nworld; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it\nme, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their\nerrands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.\"\n\nSancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,\nand giving them to the lad he said, \"Here, take this, brother Andres, for\nwe have all of us a share in your misfortune.\"\n\n\"Why, what share have you got?\"\n\n\"This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\" answered Sancho; \"and\nGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I would\nhave you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to bear a\ngreat deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things more easily\nfelt than told.\"\n\nAndres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him\nanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying\nis. However, before leaving he said, \"For the love of God, sir\nknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting\nme to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune,\nwhich will not be so great but that a greater will come to me by being\nhelped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever\nbeen born God send his curse.\"\n\nDon Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at\nsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen\nwas Don Quixote at Andres' story, and the others had to take great care\nto restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of\ncountenance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE'S PARTY AT THE INN\n\n\nTheir dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without any\nadventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the object of\nSancho Panza's fear and dread; but though he would have rather not\nentered it, there was no help for it. The landlady, the landlord, their\ndaughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming,\nwent out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which Don\nQuixote received with dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better\nbed for him than the last time: to which the landlady replied that if he\npaid better than he did the last time she would give him one fit for a\nprince. Don Quixote said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for\nhim in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely\nshaken and in want of sleep.\n\nNo sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the\nbarber, and seizing him by the beard, said:\n\n\"By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you\nmust give me back tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my\nhusband's goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to\nstick in my good tail.\"\n\nBut for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the\nlicentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further\noccasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear\nin his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn\nwhen those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for\nthe princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on\nbefore her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was\ncoming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this the\nbarber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time\nthey returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect Don\nQuixote's deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with\nastonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure of\nthe shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as there\nwas in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them\nup a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was asleep, and\nthey thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would now do him more\ngood than eating.\n\nWhile at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife, their\ndaughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the strange\ncraze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found; and the\nlandlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier; and\nthen, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she saw he was not,\nshe gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which they received with\nno little amusement. But on the curate observing that it was the books of\nchivalry which Don Quixote had read that had turned his brain, the\nlandlord said:\n\n\"I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is no\nbetter reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them, with\nother writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plenty\nmore; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays,\nand there is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of\nthese books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us, and stay\nlistening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young\nagain. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what furious and\nterrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the longing to do\nthe same, and I would like to be hearing about them night and day.\"\n\n\"And I just as much,\" said the landlady, \"because I never have a quiet\nmoment in my house except when you are listening to some one reading; for\nthen you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Maritornes; \"and, faith, I relish hearing these\nthings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they\ndescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange\ntrees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy\nand fright; all this I say is as good as honey.\"\n\n\"And you, what do you think, young lady?\" said the curate turning to the\nlandlord's daughter.\n\n\"I don't know indeed, senor,\" said she; \"I listen too, and to tell the\ntruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not\nthe blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights\nutter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they\nsometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.\"\n\n\"Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?\"\nsaid Dorothea.\n\n\"I don't know what I should do,\" said the girl; \"I only know that there\nare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers and\nlions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don't know what sort\nof folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than bestow\na glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I don't know\nwhat is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's sake, why not\nmarry them? That's all they want.\"\n\n\"Hush, child,\" said the landlady; \"it seems to me thou knowest a great\ndeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\" said the\ngirl.\n\n\"Well then,\" said the curate, \"bring me these books, senor landlord, for\nI should like to see them.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said he, and going into his own room he brought out\nan old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the curate\nfound in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very good\nhand. The first that he opened he found to be \"Don Cirongilio of Thrace,\"\nand the second \"Don Felixmarte of Hircania,\" and the other the \"History\nof the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of Diego\nGarcia de Paredes.\"\n\nWhen the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber\nand said, \"We want my friend's housekeeper and niece here now.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the barber, \"I can do just as well to carry them to the yard\nor to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\"\n\n\"What! your worship would burn my books!\" said the landlord.\n\n\"Only these two,\" said the curate, \"Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\"\n\n\"Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmaties that you want to burn them?\"\nsaid the landlord.\n\n\"Schismatics you mean, friend,\" said the barber, \"not phlegmatics.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said the landlord; \"but if you want to burn any, let it be\nthat about the Great Captain and that Diego Garcia; for I would rather\nhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\"\n\n\"Brother,\" said the curate, \"those two books are made up of lies, and are\nfull of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true\nhistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by\nhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of\nthe Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him\nalone; and this Diego Garcia de Paredes was a distinguished knight of the\ncity of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of such\nbodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in full\nmotion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge he\nkept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved such\nother exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with the\nmodesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free and\nunbiassed writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the shade\nall the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.\"\n\n\"Tell that to my father,\" said the landlord. \"There's a thing to be\nastonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read\nwhat I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single\nbackstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they had\nbeen made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make; and\nanother time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in which there\nwere more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed from\nhead to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of sheep.\n\n\"And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was so\nstout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that as\nhe was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the water\nagainst him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung himself\nupon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed its throat\nwith both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he was\nthrottling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the bottom of\nthe river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go his hold; and\nwhen they got down there he found himself among palaces and gardens so\npretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent changed itself\ninto an old ancient man, who told him such things as were never heard.\nHold your peace, senor; for if you were to hear this you would go mad\nwith delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain and your Diego\nGarcia!\"\n\nHearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, \"Our landlord is\nalmost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Cardenio, \"for, as he shows, he accepts it as a\ncertainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it is\nwritten down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not persuade him\nto the contrary.\"\n\n\"But consider, brother,\" said the curate once more, \"there never was any\nFelixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace, or any\nof the other knights of the same sort, that the books of chivalry talk\nof; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of idle wits,\ndevised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling the time, as\nyour reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all seriousness\nthere never were any such knights in the world, and no such exploits or\nnonsense ever happened anywhere.\"\n\n\"Try that bone on another dog,\" said the landlord; \"as if I did not know\nhow many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don't think to feed me\nwith pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your worship to\ntry and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense and\nlies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council,\nas if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printed\nall together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take away\none's senses.\"\n\n\"I have told you, friend,\" said the curate, \"that this is done to divert\nour idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess, fives,\nand billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care, or\nare not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowed\nto be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the truth, there\ncan be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories; and if\nit were permitted me now, and the present company desired it, I could say\nsomething about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be good\nones, that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but I\nhope the time will come when I can communicate my ideas to some one who\nmay be able to mend matters; and in the meantime, senor landlord, believe\nwhat I have said, and take your books, and make up your mind about their\ntruth or falsehood, and much good may they do you; and God grant you may\nnot fall lame of the same foot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" returned the landlord; \"I shall not be so mad as to\nmake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are not\nnow as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous knights\nroamed about the world.\"\n\nSancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and he\nwas very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about\nknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry\nbeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what\ncame of this journey of his master's, and if it did not turn out as\nhappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back to\nhis wife and children and his ordinary labour.\n\nThe landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate\nsaid to him, \"Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are written\nin such a good hand.\" The landlord taking them out handed them to him to\nread, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of\nmanuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \"Novel\nof the Ill-advised Curiosity.\" The curate read three or four lines to\nhimself, and said, \"I must say the title of this novel does not seem to\nme a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\" To which the\nlandlord replied, \"Then your reverence will do well to read it, for I can\ntell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased\nwith it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give\nit, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and\npapers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though\nI know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I\nam an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\"\n\n\"You are very right, friend,\" said the curate; \"but for all that, if the\nnovel pleases me you must let me copy it.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied the host.\n\nWhile they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read\nit, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to\nread it so that they might all hear it.\n\n\"I would read it,\" said the curate, \"if the time would not be better\nspent in sleeping.\"\n\n\"It will be rest enough for me,\" said Dorothea, \"to while away the time\nby listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to\nlet me sleep when it would be seasonable.\"\n\n\"Well then, in that case,\" said the curate, \"I will read it, if it were\nonly out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\"\n\nMaster Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too;\nseeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and\nreceive it himself, the curate said, \"Well then, attend to me everyone,\nfor the novel begins thus.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\"\n\n\nIn Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called\nTuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and\nLothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called\nby all that knew them \"The Two Friends.\" They were unmarried, young, of\nthe same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the\nreciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat\nmore inclined to seek pleasure in love than Lothario, for whom the\npleasures of the chase had more attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would\nforego his own tastes to yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would\nsurrender his to fall in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their\ninclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that\nthe best regulated clock could not surpass it.\n\nAnselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the\nsame city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable\nherself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario,\nwithout whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so,\nLothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation\nso much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in\npossession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having\nwon Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven\nand to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her. The\nfirst few days, those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making,\nLothario frequented his friend Anselmo's house as he had been wont,\nstriving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and to gratify him in\nevery way he could; but when the wedding days were over and the\nsuccession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he began\npurposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to\nhim, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends' houses\nought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in\ntheir masters' bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship\ncannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a married man's\nhonour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from\nbrothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the cessation of\nLothario's visits, and complained of it to him, saying that if he had\nknown that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his society as he used,\nhe would have never married; and that, if by the thorough harmony that\nsubsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a\nsweet name as that of \"The Two Friends,\" he should not allow a title so\nrare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act\ncircumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase was allowable\nbetween them, to be once more master of his house and to come in and go\nout as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no other desire\nor inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and that\nknowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see such\ncoldness in him.\n\nTo all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him\nto come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario\nreplied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was\nsatisfied of his friend's good intentions, and it was agreed that on two\ndays in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him;\nbut though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to\nobserve it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the\nhonour of his friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He\nsaid, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a\nbeautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to\nhis house as what female friends his wife associated with, for what\ncannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public\nfestivals or at stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny\ntheir wives), may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or\nrelative in whom most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that\nevery married man should have some friend who would point out to him any\nnegligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes\nhappen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either\nhe does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to\ndo or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter\nof honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily\ncorrect if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found as\nLothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true?\n\nOf a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost\ncare and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove\nto diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his\nhouse according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man,\nwealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of\npossessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be\nregarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle\npublic. For though his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous\ntongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or\nthat of his friend; and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he\ndevoted to some other business which he pretended was unavoidable; so\nthat a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints on one side\nand excuses on the other. It happened, however, that on one occasion when\nthe two were strolling together outside the city, Anselmo addressed the\nfollowing words to Lothario.\n\n\"Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give\nsufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the\nson of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard\nhand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune, and\nabove all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and Camilla\nfor a wife--two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I ought, at\nleast as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good things, which\nare commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, I am the\nmost discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know\nnot how long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so\nstrange and so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide\nmyself when I am alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own\nthoughts, and with no better success than if I were endeavouring\ndeliberately to publish it to all the world; and as, in short, it must\ncome out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by\nthis means, and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I\nshall soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy\ncare will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused\nme misery.\"\n\nThe words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he was\nto conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though be\nstrove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,\nhis conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety\nwhich this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a\nflagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous\nmethods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew he\nmight reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in carrying\nthem into effect.\n\n\"That is the truth,\" replied Anselmo, \"and relying upon that I will tell\nthee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that of\nknowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think her\nto be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except by\ntesting her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of her\nvirtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded, my\nfriend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not\ntempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises,\ngifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks does a\nwoman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad, and what\nwonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity\nis given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take\nher life the first time he detects her in an impropriety? I do not\ntherefore hold her who is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in\nthe same estimation as her who comes out of temptation and trial with a\ncrown of victory; and so, for these reasons and many others that I could\ngive thee to justify and support the opinion I hold, I am desirous that\nmy wife Camilla should pass this crisis, and be refined and tested by the\nfire of finding herself wooed and by one worthy to set his affections\nupon her; and if she comes out, as I know she will, victorious from this\nstruggle, I shall look upon my good fortune as unequalled, I shall be\nable to say that the cup of my desire is full, and that the virtuous\nwoman of whom the sage says 'Who shall find her?' has fallen to my lot.\nAnd if the result be the contrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction\nof knowing that I have been right in my opinion, I shall bear without\ncomplaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally\ncause me. And, as nothing of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish\nwill avail to keep me from carrying it into effect, it is my desire,\nfriend Lothario, that thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for\neffecting this purpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee\nopportunities to that end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think\nnecessary for the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and\nhigh-minded woman. And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this\narduous task to thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by\nthee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to\naccount that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left\nundone; thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and\nmy wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know\nwell will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,\ntherefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou wilt\nat once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor slothfully, but\nwith the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and with the loyalty our\nfriendship assures me of.\"\n\nSuch were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them\nwith such attention that, except to say what has been already mentioned,\nhe did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then perceiving\nthat he had no more to say, after regarding him for awhile, as one would\nregard something never before seen that excited wonder and amazement, he\nsaid to him, \"I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my friend, that what thou\nhast said to me is not in jest; if I thought that thou wert speaking\nseriously I would not have allowed thee to go so far; so as to put a stop\nto thy long harangue by not listening to thee I verily suspect that\neither thou dost not know me, or I do not know thee; but no, I know well\nthou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that I am Lothario; the misfortune is,\nit seems to me, that thou art not the Anselmo thou wert, and must have\nthought that I am not the Lothario I should be; for the things that thou\nhast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are\nthose that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thou\nknowest. True friends will prove their friends and make use of them, as a\npoet has said, usque ad aras; whereby he meant that they will not make\nuse of their friendship in things that are contrary to God's will. If\nthis, then, was a heathen's feeling about friendship, how much more\nshould it be a Christian's, who knows that the divine must not be\nforfeited for the sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go\nso far as to put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his\nfriend, it should not be in matters that are trifling or of little\nmoment, but in such as affect the friend's life and honour. Now tell me,\nAnselmo, in which of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard\nmyself to gratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest\nof me? Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as\nI understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to\nrob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it is\nplain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than dead;\nand being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much wrong to\nthee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and consequently without\nlife? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not impatient to answer me\nuntil I have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire,\nfor there will be time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Anselmo, \"say what thou wilt.\"\n\nLothario then went on to say, \"It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is\njust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can\nnever be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the\nHoly Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the\nunderstanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have\nexamples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not\nadmitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be\ndenied, like, 'If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are equal:'\nand if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they do not, it\nhas to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their eyes, and\neven with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the truth of our\nholy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have to adopt with\nthee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so absurd and remote\nfrom everything that has a semblance of reason, that I feel it would be a\nwaste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy simplicity, for at\npresent I will call it by no other name; and I am even tempted to leave\nthee in thy folly as a punishment for thy pernicious desire; but the\nfriendship I bear thee, which will not allow me to desert thee in such\nmanifest danger of destruction, keeps me from dealing so harshly by thee.\nAnd that thou mayest clearly see this, say, Anselmo, hast thou not told\nme that I must force my suit upon a modest woman, decoy one that is\nvirtuous, make overtures to one that is pure-minded, pay court to one\nthat is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me so. Then, if thou knowest that\nthou hast a wife, modest, virtuous, pure-minded and prudent, what is it\nthat thou seekest? And if thou believest that she will come forth\nvictorious from all my attacks--as doubtless she would--what higher\ntitles than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst upon her\nthen, or in what will she be better then than she is now? Either thou\ndost not hold her to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou\ndost demand. If thou dost not hold her to be what thou why dost thou seek\nto prove her instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem\nbest to thee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an\nuncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after trial,\nit will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it is\nconclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than advantage\nmay come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds, more\nespecially when they are things which we are not forced or compelled to\nattempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly madness to attempt\nthem.\n\n\"Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake of\nthe world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those which\nthe saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels in\nhuman bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of the\nmen who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of\nclimates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are called the\nblessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of God and the\nworld together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in\nthe enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could make, than,\ncasting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the manifest peril\nthat threatens them, borne onward by the desire of defending their faith,\ntheir country, and their king, they fling themselves dauntlessly into the\nmidst of the thousand opposing deaths that await them. Such are the\nthings that men are wont to attempt, and there is honour, glory, gain, in\nattempting them, however full of difficulty and peril they may be; but\nthat which thou sayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not\nwin thee the glory of God nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among\nmen; for even if the issue be as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no\nhappier, richer, or more honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be\notherwise thou wilt be reduced to misery greater than can be imagined,\nfor then it will avail thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of\nthe misfortune that has befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and\ncrush thee that thou knowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth\nof what I say, let me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet\nLuigi Tansillo at the end of the first part of his 'Tears of Saint\nPeter,' which says thus:\n\nThe anguish and the shame but greater grew In Peter's heart as morning\nslowly came; No eye was there to see him, well he knew, Yet he himself\nwas to himself a shame; Exposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view,\nA noble heart will feel the pang the same; A prey to shame the sinning\nsoul will be, Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.\n\nThus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather\nthou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of\nblood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet\ntells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,\nbetter advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction it\ncontains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.\nMoreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the\ngreat error thou wouldst commit.\n\n\"Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and\nlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence and\npurity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied,\nsaying with one voice and common consent that in purity, quality, and\nfineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be, thou\nthyself too being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to the contrary,\nwould it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place\nit between an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and strength\nof arm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? And if thou\ndidst, and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add\nnothing to its value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might\nbe, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to be\nrated as a fool in the opinion of all. Consider, then, Anselmo my friend,\nthat Camilla is a diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation\nas in that of others, and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to\nthe risk of being broken; for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a\nhigher value than she now possesses; and if she give way and be unable to\nresist, bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what\ngood reason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of\nher ruin and thine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so\nprecious as a chaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of\nwomen consists in reputation; and since thy wife's is of that high\nexcellence that thou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that\ntruth in question? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect\nanimal, and that impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her\ntrip and fall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear\nof all obstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely\nto attain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.\nNaturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur of\npurest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make use of\nthis artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequents and\npasses, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it, drive it\ntowards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud it halts,\nand allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass through the mire,\nand spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values more than life and\nliberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine, and whiter and purer\nthan snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who wishes her not to lose it,\nbut to keep and preserve it, must adopt a course different from that\nemployed with the ermine; he must not put before her the mire of the\ngifts and attentions of persevering lovers, because perhaps--and even\nwithout a perhaps--she may not have sufficient virtue and natural\nstrength in herself to pass through and tread under foot these\nimpediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of virtue and the\nbeauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuous woman, too, is\nlike a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be tarnished and\ndimmed by every breath that touches it. She must be treated as relics\nare; adored, not touched. She must be protected and prized as one\nprotects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and flowers, the owner of\nwhich allows no one to trespass or pluck a blossom; enough for others\nthat from afar and through the iron grating they may enjoy its fragrance\nand its beauty. Finally let me repeat to thee some verses that come to my\nmind; I heard them in a modern comedy, and it seems to me they bear upon\nthe point we are discussing. A prudent old man was giving advice to\nanother, the father of a young girl, to lock her up, watch over her and\nkeep her in seclusion, and among other arguments he used these:\n\nWoman is a thing of glass;\nBut her brittleness 'tis best\nNot too curiously to test:\nWho knows what may come to pass?\n\nBreaking is an easy matter,\nAnd it's folly to expose\nWhat you cannot mend to blows;\nWhat you can't make whole to shatter.\n\nThis, then, all may hold as true,\nAnd the reason's plain to see;\nFor if Danaes there be,\nThere are golden showers too.\n\n\"All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to what\nconcerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what\nregards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into\nwhich thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate\nthee makes it necessary.\n\n\"Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a\nthing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim at\nthis, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou wouldst rob\nme of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court to her as thou\nrequirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without honour or right\nfeeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what I owe to\nmy own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst have me rob thee of\nit is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I press my suit upon her,\nwill suppose that I have perceived in her something light that has\nencouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she holds\nherself dishonoured, her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her; and\nhence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of the\nadulterous woman, though he may not be aware of or have given any cause\nfor his wife's failure in her duty, or (being careless or negligent) have\nhad it in his power to prevent his dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised\nby a vile and reproachful name, and in a manner regarded with eyes of\ncontempt instead of pity by all who know of his wife's guilt, though they\nsee that he is unfortunate not by his own fault, but by the lust of a\nvicious consort. But I will tell thee why with good reason dishonour\nattaches to the husband of the unchaste wife, though he know not that she\nis so, nor be to blame, nor have done anything, or given any provocation\nto make her so; and be not weary with listening to me, for it will be for\nthy good.\n\n\"When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy\nScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took a\nrib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when Adam\nawoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my\nbone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his father and his\nmother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted the\ndivine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can loose\nthem. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that\nit makes two different persons one and the same flesh; and even more than\nthis when the virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they\nhave but one will. And hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is\none and the same with that of her husband the stains that may come upon\nit, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the husband's flesh, though he,\nas has been said, may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of\nthe foot or any member of the body is felt by the whole body, because all\nis one flesh, as the head feels the hurt to the ankle without having\ncaused it, so the husband, being one with her, shares the dishonour of\nthe wife; and as all worldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and\nblood, and the erring wife's is of that kind, the husband must needs bear\nhis part of it and be held dishonoured without knowing it. See, then,\nAnselmo, the peril thou art encountering in seeking to disturb the peace\nof thy virtuous consort; see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity\nthou wouldst rouse up passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of\nthy chaste wife; reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little,\nand what thou wilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having\nthe words to express it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn\nthee from thy vile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy\ndishonour and misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I\nlose thy friendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.\"\n\nHaving said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and Anselmo,\ntroubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to utter a\nword in reply; but at length he said, \"I have listened, Lothario my\nfriend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say\nto me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that\nhigh intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true\nfriendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am\nnot guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good\nand pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must remember that I am now\nlabouring under that infirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when\nthe craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things even\nworse, disgusting to look at, much more to eat; so that it will be\nnecessary to have recourse to some artifice to cure me; and this can be\neasily effected if only thou wilt make a beginning, even though it be in\na lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to pay court to Camilla, who will\nnot be so yielding that her virtue will give way at the first attack:\nwith this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied, and thou wilt have done\nwhat our friendship binds thee to do, not only in giving me life, but in\npersuading me not to discard my honour. And this thou art bound to do for\none reason alone, that, being, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it\nis not for thee to permit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so\nimperil that honour thou art striving to keep me from losing; and if\nthine may not stand as high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla\nwhile thou art paying court to her, that is of little or no importance,\nbecause ere long, on finding in her that constancy which we expect, thou\ncanst tell her the plain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain\nthy place in her esteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the\nventure canst afford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it,\neven if further difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have\nsaid, if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue\ndecided.\"\n\nLothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing what\nfurther examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade him\nfrom it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his pernicious\nscheme to some one else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify him\nand do what he asked, intending to manage the business so as to satisfy\nAnselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in reply he told him\nnot to communicate his purpose to any other, for he would undertake the\ntask himself, and would begin it as soon as he pleased. Anselmo embraced\nhim warmly and affectionately, and thanked him for his offer as if he had\nbestowed some great favour upon him; and it was agreed between them to\nset about it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and time to\nLothario to converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him with money\nand jewels to offer and present to her. He suggested, too, that he should\ntreat her to music, and write verses in her praise, and if he was\nunwilling to take the trouble of composing them, he offered to do it\nhimself. Lothario agreed to all with an intention very different from\nwhat Anselmo supposed, and with this understanding they returned to\nAnselmo's house, where they found Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously\nand uneasily, for he was later than usual in returning that day. Lothario\nrepaired to his own house, and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied\nas Lothario was troubled in mind; for he could see no satisfactory way\nout of this ill-advised business. That night, however, he thought of a\nplan by which he might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The\nnext day he went to dine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla,\nwho received and treated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection\nher husband felt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed,\nAnselmo told Lothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to\nsome pressing business, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla\nbegged him not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing\ncould persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain\nwaiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with\nhim. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until\nhe came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason,\nor the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a\npretence.\n\nAnselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at\nthe table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw\nhimself in the lists according to his friend's wish, and facing an enemy\nthat could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights;\njudge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his\nelbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking\nCamilla's pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a little\nsleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose more\nat his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to\ngo in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained\nasleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room,\nand Lothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have\nafforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was\nall impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with\nhim and question him as to his success. Everything fell out as he wished;\nLothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked\nwhat he was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him that he had\nnot thought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and\ntherefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all\nthe city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to\nhim an excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her\ndisposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing\nhimself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive one\nwho is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms\nhimself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming,\ndiscloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at the beginning\nhis wiles are not discovered. All this gave great satisfaction to\nAnselmo, and he said he would afford the same opportunity every day, but\nwithout leaving the house, for he would find things to do at home so that\nCamilla should not detect the plot.\n\nThus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word\nto Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he\nhad never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of consent\nto anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope; on the\ncontrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.\n\n\"So far well,\" said Anselmo; \"Camilla has thus far resisted words; we\nmust now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two\nthousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many\nmore to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly\nattired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are\nbeautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this\ntemptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.\"\n\nLothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertaking\nto the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and\nvanquished. The next day he received the four thousand crowns, and with\nthem four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what to say by way of a\nnew falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that\nCamilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as against words, and\nthat there was no use in taking any further trouble, for the time was all\nspent to no purpose.\n\nBut chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that\nAnselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,\nshut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen\nthrough the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for\nmore than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor\nwould utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came to\nthe conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies of\nCamilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were so,\nhe came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had and in\nwhat humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not disposed to go\non with the business, for she had answered him so angrily and harshly\nthat he had no heart to say anything more to her.\n\n\"Ah, Lothario, Lothario,\" said Anselmo, \"how ill dost thou meet thy\nobligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have been\njust now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou has not\nsaid a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasions\nthou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is,\nwhy dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive\nme of the means I might find of attaining my desire?\"\n\nAnselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with shame\nand confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by having\nbeen detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that moment\ndevote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he would see\nif he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the trouble,\nfor the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all suspicions\nfrom his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an opportunity\nmore free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to absent himself from\nhis house for eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend of his who\nlived in a village not far from the city; and, the better to account for\nhis departure to Camilla, he so arranged it that the friend should send\nhim a very pressing invitation.\n\nUnhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou\nplotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against\nthyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy wife\nCamilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness, no one\nassails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls of thy\nhouse, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes, the\nfulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her will,\nmaking it conform in all things to thine and Heaven's. If, then, the mine\nof her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without labour all\nthe wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt thou dig the\nearth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure, risking the\ncollapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of her weak\nnature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities that which\nis possible may with justice be withheld, as was better expressed by a\npoet who said:\n\n'Tis mine to seek for life in death,\nHealth in disease seek I,\nI seek in prison freedom's breath,\nIn traitors loyalty.\nSo Fate that ever scorns to grant\nOr grace or boon to me,\nSince what can never be I want,\nDenies me what might be.\n\nThe next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving\ninstructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come to\nlook after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treat him\nas she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and\nright-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and bade\nhim remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his seat\nat the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not feeling\nconfidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him try her\nthis time, and he would find by experience that she was equal to greater\nresponsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure to have it so,\nand that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said she would do so,\nthough against her will.\n\nAnselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was\nreceived by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never\nsuffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her\nmen and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by\nname, to whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up\ntogether from childhood in her father's house), and whom she had kept\nwith her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario\ndid not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed the\ncloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla's\norders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and\nnever to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon\nother things more to her taste, and wanting that time and opportunity for\nher own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress's commands, but on\nthe contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered her to do so; but\nthe modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her countenance, the\ncomposure of her aspect were enough to bridle the tongue of Lothario. But\nthe influence which the many virtues of Camilla exerted in imposing\nsilence on Lothario's tongue proved mischievous for both of them, for if\nhis tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, and could dwell at leisure\nupon the perfections of Camilla's goodness and beauty one by one, charms\nenough to warm with love a marble statue, not to say a heart of flesh.\nLothario gazed upon her when he might have been speaking to her, and\nthought how worthy of being loved she was; and thus reflection began\nlittle by little to assail his allegiance to Anselmo, and a thousand\ntimes he thought of withdrawing from the city and going where Anselmo\nshould never see him nor he see Camilla. But already the delight he found\nin gazing on her interposed and held him fast. He put a constraint upon\nhimself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he found in\ncontemplating Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for his weakness,\ncalled himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he argued the\nmatter and compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the conclusion\nthat the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his\nfaithlessness, and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily\nbefore God as with man, he had no reason to fear any punishment for his\noffence.\n\nIn short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunity\nwhich the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew the loyalty of\nLothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which his\ninclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three days absent, during\nwhich he had been carrying on a continual struggle with his passion, he\nbegan to make love to Camilla with so much vehemence and warmth of\nlanguage that she was overwhelmed with amazement, and could only rise\nfrom her place and retire to her room without answering him a word. But\nthe hope which always springs up with love was not weakened in Lothario\nby this repelling demeanour; on the contrary his passion for Camilla\nincreased, and she discovering in him what she had never expected, knew\nnot what to do; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him the\nchance or opportunity of speaking to her again, she resolved to send, as\nshe did that very night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in\nwhich she addressed the following words to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\"\n\n\n\"It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a\ncastle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks\nstill worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for\nit. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of\nenduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to\ngo for relief to my parents' house, even if I leave yours without a\nprotector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title,\nhas, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you:\nas you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed\nis it fitting I should say more.\"\n\nAnselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had\nalready begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he\nwould have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he\nsent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would very\nshortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo's reply, which placed\nher in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to remain in\nher own house, nor yet to go to her parents'; for in remaining her virtue\nwas imperilled, and in going she was opposing her husband's commands.\nFinally she decided upon what was the worse course for her, to remain,\nresolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she might not\ngive food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret having\nwritten as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine that Lothario\nhad perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay aside\nthe respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her trust\nin God and in her own virtuous intentions, with which she hoped to resist\nin silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to\nher husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she\neven began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should\nask her what it was that induced her to write that letter. With these\nresolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained\nthe next day listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously\nthat Camilla's firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do\nto come to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a\ncertain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had\nawakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him\nall the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo's absence afforded time\nand opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he\nassailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is nothing\nthat more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women's\nvanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact with the\nutmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with such engines\nthat had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He wept, he\nentreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he pretended with so\nmuch feeling and apparent sincerity, that he overthrew the virtuous\nresolves of Camilla and won the triumph he least expected and most longed\nfor. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of\nLothario could not stand firm? A clear proof to us that the passion of\nlove is to be conquered only by flying from it, and that no one should\nengage in a struggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is\nneeded to overcome his human power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress's\nweakness, for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal\nit. Lothario did not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view,\nnor that he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result,\nlest she should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and\nwithout intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to\nher.\n\nA few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive what\nit had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized. He\nwent at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they embraced each\nother, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his death.\n\n\"The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,\" said Lothario, \"are\nthat thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown\nof all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were borne away\non the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have been\nrefused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open\nridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she\nthe treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty abide\nwith all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon a\nwoman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no need\nto touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as\ngifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further\nproof; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts\nand suspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to\nplunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with another\npilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has\ngranted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world; but reckon\nthyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of sound\nreflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt\nwhich no nobility on earth can escape paying.\"\n\nAnselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed\nthem as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he\nbegged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake\nof curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of\nthe same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to\nwrite some verses to her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for he\nhimself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to\nwhom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the\ndecorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to take the\ntrouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself.\n\n\"That will not be necessary,\" said Lothario, \"for the muses are not such\nenemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the\nyear. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended\namour of mine; as for the verses will make them, and if not as good as\nthe subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.\" An\nagreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised\none and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla\nthe question she already wondered he had not asked before--what it was\nthat had caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla replied\nthat it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more\nfreely than when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and\nbelieved it to have been only her own imagination, for Lothario now\navoided seeing her, or being alone with her. Anselmo told her she might\nbe quite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he knew that Lothario\nwas in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under\nthe name of Chloris, and that even if he were not, his fidelity and their\ngreat friendship left no room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been\ninformed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a\npretence, and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able\nsometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt\nshe would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being\nforewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness.\n\nThe next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite\nsomething of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as\nCamilla did not know her, he might safely say what he liked.\n\n\"Even did she know her,\" returned Lothario, \"I would hide nothing, for\nwhen a lover praises his lady's beauty, and charges her with cruelty, he\ncasts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say is\nthat yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which\ngoes thus:\n\nSONNET\n\nAt midnight, in the silence, when the eyes\n  Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close,\n  The weary tale of my unnumbered woes\nTo Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.\nAnd when the light of day returning dyes\n  The portals of the east with tints of rose,\n  With undiminished force my sorrow flows\nIn broken accents and in burning sighs.\nAnd when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,\n  And on the earth pours down his midday beams,\n    Noon but renews my wailing and my tears;\nAnd with the night again goes up my moan.\n  Yet ever in my agony it seems\n    To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.\"\n\nThe sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it and\nsaid the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so\nmanifest. On which Camilla said, \"Then all that love-smitten poets say is\ntrue?\"\n\n\"As poets they do not tell the truth,\" replied Lothario; \"but as lovers\nthey are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" observed Anselmo, anxious to support and\nuphold Lothario's ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his design\nas she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in anything\nthat was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for\ntheir object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she asked him to\nrepeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.\n\n\"I do,\" replied Lothario, \"but I do not think it as good as the first\none, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for\nit is this.\n\nSONNET\n\nI know that I am doomed; death is to me\n  As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,\n  Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere\nMy heart repented of its love for thee.\nIf buried in oblivion I should be,\n  Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there\n  It would be found that I thy image bear\nDeep graven in my breast for all to see.\nThis like some holy relic do I prize\n  To save me from the fate my truth entails,\n    Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.\nAlas for him that under lowering skies,\n  In peril o'er a trackless ocean sails,\n    Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.\"\n\nAnselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first; and\nso he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was\nbinding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was\ndoing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus\neach step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement, she\nmounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame.\n\nIt so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid,\nCamilla said to her, \"I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly\nI have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by at\nleast some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I so\nquickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think ill of\nmy pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he\nbrought to bear upon me.\"\n\n\"Let not that trouble you, my lady,\" said Leonela, \"for it does not take\naway the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it\nquickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they\nare wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.\"\n\n\"They say also,\" said Camilla, \"that what costs little is valued less.\"\n\n\"That saying does not hold good in your case,\" replied Leonela, \"for\nlove, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this\none it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns;\nsome it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and\nat the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay\nsiege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no\npower that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear,\nwhen the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence\nof my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely\nnecessary to complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording\nthe time to let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be\nleft unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his\ndesigns than opportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his\nfeats, especially at the outset. All this I know well myself, more by\nexperience than by hearsay, and some day, senora, I will enlighten you on\nthe subject, for I am of your flesh and blood too. Moreover, lady\nCamilla, you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that\nfirst you saw Lothario's whole soul in his eyes, in his sighs, in his\nwords, his promises and his gifts, and by it and his good qualities\nperceived how worthy he was of your love. This, then, being the case, let\nnot these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, but be\nassured that Lothario prizes you as you do him, and rest content and\nsatisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth\nand merit that has taken you, and one that has not only the four S's that\nthey say true lovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen\nto me and you will see how I can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and\nthinking, Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay,\nHonourable, Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted,\nRich, and the S's according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X\ndoes not suit him, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already;\nand Z Zealous for your honour.\"\n\nCamilla laughed at her maid's alphabet, and perceived her to be more\nexperienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted, confessing\nto Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of\nthe same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might prove\nthe means of endangering her honour, and asked whether her intrigue had\ngone beyond words, and she with little shame and much effrontery said it\nhad; for certain it is that ladies' imprudences make servants shameless,\nwho, when they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing of\ngoing astray themselves, or of its being known. All that Camilla could do\nwas to entreat Leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she\ncalled her lover, and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they\nshould come to the knowledge of Anselmo or of Lothario. Leonela said she\nwould, but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed Camilla's\napprehension of losing her reputation through her means; for this\nabandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she perceived that her mistress's\ndemeanour was not what it was wont to be, had the audacity to introduce\nher lover into the house, confident that even if her mistress saw him she\nwould not dare to expose him; for the sins of mistresses entail this\nmischief among others; they make themselves the slaves of their own\nservants, and are obliged to hide their laxities and depravities; as was\nthe case with Camilla, who though she perceived, not once but many times,\nthat Leonela was with her lover in some room of the house, not only did\nnot dare to chide her, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him\nand removed all difficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She\nwas unable, however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as\nhe sallied forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was,\nat first took him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away,\nmuffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and\ncautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which\nwould have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did\nnot occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an\nuntimely hour from Anselmo's house could have entered it on Leonela's\naccount, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela; all\nhe thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with him, so\nshe had been with another; for this further penalty the erring woman's\nsin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by him to whose\novertures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes her to have\nsurrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credence to every\nsuspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario's good sense seems to\nhave failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maxims escaped his\nmemory; for without once reflecting rationally, and without more ado, in\nhis impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage that gnawed his\nheart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who had done him no\nwrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him and said to him,\n\"Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been struggling with\nmyself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or\nright that I should conceal from thee. Know that Camilla's fortress has\nsurrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and if I have been slow to\nreveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see if it were some light\ncaprice of hers, or if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love I\nbegan to make to her with thy permission was made with a serious\nintention. I thought, too, that she, if she were what she ought to be,\nand what we both believed her, would have ere this given thee information\nof my addresses; but seeing that she delays, I believe the truth of the\npromise she has given me that the next time thou art absent from the\nhouse she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels are\nkept (and it was true that Camilla used to meet him there); but I do not\nwish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin is as yet\nonly committed in intention, and Camilla's may change perhaps between\nthis and the appointed time, and repentance spring up in its place. As\nhitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part, follow\nand observe this that I will give thee now, so that, without mistake, and\nwith mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem\nthe best course; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou\nhast been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in\nthe closet; for the tapestries and other things there afford great\nfacilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own\neyes and I with mine what Camilla's purpose may be. And if it be a guilty\none, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence, prudence,\nand discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for\nthe wrong done thee.\"\n\nAnselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of Lothario,\nwhich came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them, for he\nnow looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of\nLothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory. He\nremained silent for a considerable time, looking on the ground with fixed\ngaze, and at length said, \"Thou hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of\nthy friendship: I will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt,\nand keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so\nunlooked for.\"\n\nLothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented altogether\nof what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had acted, as he\nmight have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less cruel and degrading\nway. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his hasty resolution, and\nknew not what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready\nescape from it. At last he decided upon revealing all to Camilla, and, as\nthere was no want of opportunity for doing so, he found her alone the\nsame day; but she, as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him,\nsaid, \"Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart\nwhich fills it so that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder\nif it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch\nthat every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains\nwith him till morning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is\nopen to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such\nunseasonable hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or\nchide her, for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me\nsilent about hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of\nit.\"\n\nAs Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to\ndelude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela's\nlover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered, and begged\nhim to help her, he became convinced of the truth, and the conviction\ncompleted his confusion and remorse; however, he told Camilla not to\ndistress herself, as he would take measures to put a stop to the\ninsolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what, driven by the\nfierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how he had arranged\nto hide himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little\nshe preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her pardon for this\nmadness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and escape safely from\nthe intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him. Camilla\nwas struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger,\nand great good sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and\nthe foolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by\nnature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to\nfail when she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of\nthe moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance\nirremediable, and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo\nshould conceal himself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his\nconcealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the\nfuture without any apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him\nentirely she charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed,\nto come to her when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him\nto answer as he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was\nlistening. Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that\nhe might with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw\nto be needful.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said Camilla, \"there is nothing to take care of except to\nanswer me what I shall ask you;\" for she did not wish to explain to him\nbeforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to\nfollow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try or\ndevise some other less practicable plan.\n\nLothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of going\nto his friend's country house, took his departure, and then returned to\nconceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonela\ntook care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding\nin the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who\nexpected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, and\nfound himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he\npossessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo's being in\nhis hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instant\nshe set foot within it Camilla said, with a deep sigh, \"Ah! dear Leonela,\nwould it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you should know\nlest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take Anselmo's dagger\nthat I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But\nno; there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another's\nfault. I will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of\nLothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a\ndesign so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend\nand of my honour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt\nhe is in the street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine,\ncruel it may be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.\"\n\n\"Ah, senora,\" said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, \"what is it you\nwant to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your own\nlife, or Lothario's? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to the\nloss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble your\nwrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now\nand finding us alone; consider, senora, we are weak women and he is a\nman, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose, blind and\nurged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may\ndo what will be worse for you than taking your life. Ill betide my\nmaster, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house to this shameless\nfellow! And supposing you kill him, senora, as I suspect you mean to do,\nwhat shall we do with him when he is dead?\"\n\n\"What, my friend?\" replied Camilla, \"we shall leave him for Anselmo to\nbury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his own\ninfamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I delay in\ntaking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty\nI owe my husband.\"\n\nAnselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered\nmade him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to kill\nLothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert such\na disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold\nand virtuous he restrained himself, intending to come forth in time to\nprevent the deed. At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed\nthat was close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly,\nexclaiming, \"Woe is me! that I should be fated to have dying here in my\narms the flower of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the\npattern of chastity!\" with more to the same effect, so that anyone who\nheard her would have taken her for the most tender-hearted and faithful\nhandmaid in the world, and her mistress for another persecuted Penelope.\n\nCamilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to\nherself she said, \"Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that\nfriend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night\nconcealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn itself\nout with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt away in\nmenaces and maledictions.\"\n\n\"I am just going to call him, senora,\" said Leonela; \"but you must first\ngive me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of it give\ncause to all who love you to weep all their lives.\"\n\n\"Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,\" said Camilla, \"for rash\nand foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not\ngoing to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself\nwithout having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him\non whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die; but\nit must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep\nover audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.\"\n\nLeonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario,\nbut at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as\nif speaking to herself, \"Good God! would it not have been more prudent to\nhave repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allow\nhim, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the short\ntime I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it would have been\nbetter; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband\nvindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from the strait\ninto which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay with his life\nfor the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world know (if haply\nit shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only preserved her\nallegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong\nhim. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. But\nthen I have called his attention to it in the letter I wrote to him in\nthe country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the mischief I there\npointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and\ntrustfulness he would not and could not believe that any thought against\nhis honour could harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed\ndid I myself believe it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it\nif his insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open\npresents, lavish promises, and ceaseless tears. But why do I argue thus?\nDoes a bold determination stand in need of arguments? Surely not. Then\ntraitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach,\nadvance, die, yield up his life, and then befall what may. Pure I came to\nhim whom Heaven bestowed upon me, pure I shall leave him; and at the\nworst bathed in my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest\nfriend that friendship ever saw in the world;\" and as she uttered these\nwords she paced the room holding the unsheathed dagger, with such\nirregular and disordered steps, and such gestures that one would have\nsupposed her to have lost her senses, and taken her for some violent\ndesperado instead of a delicate woman.\n\nAnselmo, hidden behind some tapestries where he had concealed himself,\nbeheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen and\nheard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he would\nhave been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario's coming\nwere dispensed with, as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he was on\nthe point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and undeceive\nhis wife he paused as he saw Leonela returning, leading Lothario. Camilla\nwhen she saw him, drawing a long line in front of her on the floor with\nthe dagger, said to him, \"Lothario, pay attention to what I say to thee:\nif by any chance thou darest to cross this line thou seest, or even\napproach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that same instant will I\npierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand; and before thou\nanswerest me a word desire thee to listen to a few from me, and\nafterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First, I desire thee to\ntell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light\nthou regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too.\nAnswer me this, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt\nanswer, for they are no riddles I put to thee.\"\n\nLothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla\ndirected him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she intended\nto do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and promptly\nthat between them they made the imposture look more true than truth; so\nhe answered her thus: \"I did not think, fair Camilla, that thou wert\ncalling me to ask questions so remote from the object with which I come;\nbut if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, thou mightst\nhave put it off still longer, for the longing for happiness gives the\nmore distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest thou\nshouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy\nhusband Anselmo, and that we have known each other from our earliest\nyears; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, of our friendship, that\nI may not compel myself to testify against the wrong that love, the\nmighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflict upon him. Thee I know\nand hold in the same estimation as he does, for were it not so I had not\nfor a lesser prize acted in opposition to what I owe to my station and\nthe holy laws of true friendship, now broken and violated by me through\nthat powerful enemy, love.\"\n\n\"If thou dost confess that,\" returned Camilla, \"mortal enemy of all that\nrightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come\nbefore one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on\nwhom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou him? But, woe is me, I\nnow comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest\nto thyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call\nit immodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but\nfrom some heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence\nwhen they think they have no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor,\nwhen did I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken\nin thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy\nprofessions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When\nwere thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or\naccepted? But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the\nattempt to win love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute\nto myself the blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness\nof mine has all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish\nmyself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that\nthou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be\notherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice\nI mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, wronged by\nthee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too through\nwant of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of\nencouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say the\nsuspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these\nlawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress and what I\ndesire most to punish with my own hands, for were any other instrument of\npunishment employed my error might become perhaps more widely known; but\nbefore I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death, and take with me one\nthat will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have;\nfor I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go, the penalty awarded by\ninflexible, unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so\ndesperate.\"\n\nAs she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she flew\nupon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it in\nhis breast that he was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were\nreal or feigned, for he was obliged to have recourse to all his skill and\nstrength to prevent her from striking him; and with such reality did she\nact this strange farce and mystification that, to give it a colour of\ntruth, she determined to stain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or\npretending, that she could not wound Lothario, she said, \"Fate, it seems,\nwill not grant my just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be\nable to keep me from satisfying it partially at least;\" and making an\neffort to free the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp,\nshe released it, and directing the point to a place where it could not\ninflict a deep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to\nthe shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a\nfaint.\n\nLeonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and\nseeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they were\nstill uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario, terrified and\nbreathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he saw how\nslight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more admired\nthe subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the better\nto support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and doleful\nlamentations over her body as if she were dead, invoking maledictions not\nonly on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him in\nsuch a position: and knowing that his friend Anselmo heard him he spoke\nin such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than for\nCamilla, even though he supposed her dead. Leonela took her up in her\narms and laid her on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of some\none to attend to her wound in secret, and at the same time asking his\nadvice and opinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his lady's\nwound if he should chance to return before it was healed. He replied they\nmight say what they liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that\nwould be of any use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the\nblood, as he was going where he should never more be seen; and with every\nappearance of deep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found\nhimself alone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself\nunceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the\nconsistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would be\nthat he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forward anxiously\nto meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood and truth the\nmost craftily veiled that could be imagined.\n\nLeonela, as he told her, stanched her lady's blood, which was no more\nthan sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a\nlittle wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the\ntime she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had been\nsaid before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had in\nCamilla a model of purity. To Leonela's words Camilla added her own,\ncalling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not enough\nat the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life she so\nmuch loathed. She asked her attendant's advice as to whether or not she\nought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened, but the\nother bade her say nothing about it, as she would lay upon him the\nobligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he could not do but at\ngreat risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her\nhusband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, to remove it as far\nas possible from him.\n\nCamilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would follow\nher advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she was to\nexplain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it; to which\nLeonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even in jest.\n\n\"How then can I know, my dear?\" said Camilla, \"for I should not dare to\nforge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think\nof no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the\nplain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.\"\n\n\"Be not uneasy, senora,\" said Leonela; \"between this and to-morrow I will\nthink of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being where it is\nit can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased to aid us in\na purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself, senora, and endeavour\nto calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave the\nrest to my care and God's, who always supports good intentions.\"\n\nAnselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out\nthe tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with\nsuch wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the\nrealities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an\nopportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend\nLothario, and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he\nhad gained in having established his wife's purity. Both mistress and\nmaid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away, and taking\nadvantage of it he made his escape, and at once went in quest of\nLothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him when\nhe found him, and the things he said to him in the joy of his heart, and\nthe praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario listened to\nwithout being able to show any pleasure, for he could not forget how\ndeceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he had wronged him; and\nthough Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad, still he imagined it\nwas only because he had left Camilla wounded and had been himself the\ncause of it; and so among other things he told him not to be distressed\nabout Camilla's accident, for, as they had agreed to hide it from him,\nthe wound was evidently trifling; and that being so, he had no cause for\nfear, but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him,\nseeing that by his means and adroitness he found himself raised to the\ngreatest height of happiness that he could have ventured to hope for, and\ndesired no better pastime than making verses in praise of Camilla that\nwould preserve her name for all time to come. Lothario commended his\npurpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so\nglorious.\n\nAnd so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be\nin the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of\nhis glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of\nhis good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though\nwith smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time,\nuntil at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt\nwhich had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad,\nand Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH\nCERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF \"THE ILL-ADVISED\nCURIOSITY\" TO A CLOSE\n\n\nThere remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza\nburst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was\nlying, shouting, \"Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the\nthick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the\nliving God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess\nMicomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it\nwere a turnip.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, brother?\" said the curate, pausing as he was\nabout to read the remainder of the novel. \"Are you in your senses,\nSancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two\nthousand leagues away?\"\n\nHere they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting\nout, \"Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy\nscimitar shall not avail thee!\" And then it seemed as though he were\nslashing vigorously at the wall.\n\n\"Don't stop to listen,\" said Sancho, \"but go in and part them or help my\nmaster: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant is\ndead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life; for\nI saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on\none side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.\"\n\n\"May I die,\" said the landlord at this, \"if Don Quixote or Don Devil has\nnot been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his\nbed's head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for\nblood;\" and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and\nthere they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world. He\nwas in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs\ncompletely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long\nand lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had a\nlittle greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he\nhad rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best\nknown to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his\nunsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering\nexclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of\nit was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that\nhe was doing battle with the giant. For his imagination was so wrought\nupon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream\nhe had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in\ncombat with his enemy; and believing he was laying on the giant, he had\ngiven so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of\nwine. On seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don\nQuixote, and with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way,\nthat if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged him off, he would have\nbrought the war of the giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor\ngentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of cold water\nfrom the well and flung it with one dash all over his body, on which Don\nQuixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was the\nmatter. Dorothea, seeing how short and slight his attire was, would not\ngo in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent. As for\nSancho, he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant,\nand not finding it he said, \"I see now that it's all enchantment in this\nhouse; for the last time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so\nmany thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see\nanybody; and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw\nit cut off with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if\nfrom a fountain.\"\n\n\"What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his\nsaints?\" said the landlord. \"Don't you see, you thief, that the blood and\nthe fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red\nwine swimming all over the room?--and I wish I saw the soul of him that\nstabbed them swimming in hell.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that,\" said Sancho; \"all I know is it will be my\nbad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away like\nsalt in water;\"--for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep, so\nmuch had his master's promises addled his wits.\n\nThe landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the\nmischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the\nlast time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of\nchivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off\nwithout paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put\nto the damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote's hands,\nwho, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of\nthe Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, \"Exalted and\nbeauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of\nany harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am\nreleased from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high\nand by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled it\nso successfully.\"\n\n\"Did not I say so?\" said Sancho on hearing this. \"You see I wasn't drunk;\nthere you see my master has already salted the giant; there's no doubt\nabout the bulls; my county is all right!\"\n\nWho could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master and\nman? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; but\nat length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with no small\ntrouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with every\nappearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep, and came out\nto the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not having found the\nhead of the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord,\nwho was furious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the\nlandlady half scolding, half crying, \"At an evil moment and in an unlucky\nhour he came into my house, this knight-errant--would that I had never\nset eyes on him, for dear he has cost me; the last time he went off with\nthe overnight score against him for supper, bed, straw, and barley, for\nhimself and his squire and a hack and an ass, saying he was a knight\nadventurer--God send unlucky adventures to him and all the adventurers in\nthe world--and therefore not bound to pay anything, for it was so settled\nby the knight-errantry tariff: and then, all because of him, came the\nother gentleman and carried off my tail, and gives it back more than two\ncuartillos the worse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for\nmy husband's purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my\nwine-skins and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let\nhim not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of\nmy mother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my name is not what it\nis, and I am not my father's daughter.\" All this and more to the same\neffect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid\nMaritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled\nfrom time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good\nall losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skins\nbut also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which they\nset such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she\npledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that his master had\ndecapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully established in\nher kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there was in it. With\nthis Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she might rely\nupon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more by token it had\na beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be seen now\nit was because everything that happened in that house went by\nenchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he had lodged there.\nDorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need not be uneasy, for\nall would go well and turn out as he wished. All therefore being\nappeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the novel, as he saw there\nwas but little more left to read. Dorothea and the others begged him to\nfinish it, and he, as he was willing to please them, and enjoyed reading\nit himself, continued the tale in these words:\n\nThe result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla's\nvirtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely\nlooked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings\ntowards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to\nsupport the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the\nhouse, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence was\nplain to be seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account\nallow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of his\nown dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness. Meanwhile\nthe satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her\namour reached such a height that, regardless of everything else, she\nfollowed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident that her\nmistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage it safely. At\nlast one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela's room, and on trying\nto enter to see who it was, he found that the door was held against him,\nwhich made him all the more determined to open it; and exerting his\nstrength he forced it open, and entered the room in time to see a man\nleaping through the window into the street. He ran quickly to seize him\nor discover who he was, but he was unable to effect either purpose, for\nLeonela flung her arms round him crying, \"Be calm, senor; do not give way\nto passion or follow him who has escaped from this; he belongs to me, and\nin fact he is my husband.\"\n\nAnselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and\nthreatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill\nher. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, \"Do\nnot kill me, senor, for I can tell you things more important than any you\ncan imagine.\"\n\n\"Tell me then at once or thou diest,\" said Anselmo.\n\n\"It would be impossible for me now,\" said Leonela, \"I am so agitated:\nleave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill\nyou with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the\nwindow is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to\nbecome my husband.\"\n\nAnselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she\nasked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla, so\nsatisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room, and\nleft Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until she had\ntold him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to see\nCamilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him and her\nhandmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of\nserious importance.\n\nThere is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so\ngreat was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good reason\nto do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness,\nshe had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed;\nand that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep, she\npacked up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and without\nbeing observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to\nLothario's, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to\nconvey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be\nsafe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced\nLothario was such that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less\nto decide upon what he should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to\na convent of which a sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this,\nand with the speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to\nthe convent and left her there, and then himself quitted the city without\nletting anyone know of his departure.\n\nAs soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his side,\nrose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to the\nroom where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but found\nno Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain\nproof that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He returned,\nuneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the\nhouse he was lost in amazement. He asked the servants of the house about\nher, but none of them could give him any explanation. As he was going in\nsearch of Camilla it happened by chance that he observed her boxes were\nlying open, and that the greater part of her jewels were gone; and now he\nbecame fully aware of his disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause of\nhis misfortune; and, just as he was, without delaying to dress himself\ncompletely, he repaired, sad at heart and dejected, to his friend\nLothario to make known his sorrow to him; but when he failed to find him\nand the servants reported that he had been absent from his house all\nnight and had taken with him all the money he had, he felt as though he\nwere losing his senses; and to make all complete on returning to his own\nhouse he found it deserted and empty, not one of all his servants, male\nor female, remaining in it. He knew not what to think, or say, or do, and\nhis reason seemed to be deserting him little by little. He reviewed his\nposition, and saw himself in a moment left without wife, friend, or\nservants, abandoned, he felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all\nrobbed of his honour, for in Camilla's disappearance he saw his own ruin.\nAfter long reflection he resolved at last to go to his friend's village,\nwhere he had been staying when he afforded opportunities for the\ncontrivance of this complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of\nhis house, mounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his\njourney; but he had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his\nreflections, he had to dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot\nof which he threw himself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and\nthere he remained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man\napproaching on horseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he\nasked what was the news in Florence.\n\nThe citizen replied, \"The strangest that have been heard for many a day;\nfor it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthy\nAnselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, the\nwife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has been told by a\nmaid-servant of Camilla's, whom the governor found last night lowering\nherself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo's house. I know not\nindeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know is that the\nwhole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could have expected\na thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate friendship that\nexisted between them, so great, they say, that they were called 'The Two\nFriends.'\"\n\n\"Is it known at all,\" said Anselmo, \"what road Lothario and Camilla\ntook?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said the citizen, \"though the governor has been very\nactive in searching for them.\"\n\n\"God speed you, senor,\" said Anselmo.\n\n\"God be with you,\" said the citizen and went his way.\n\nThis disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his senses\nbut of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached the house\nof his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but seeing him\ncome pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was suffering some heavy\naffliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest, and\nto be given writing materials. His wish was complied with and he was left\nlying down and alone, for he desired this, and even that the door should\nbe locked. Finding himself alone he so took to heart the thought of his\nmisfortune that by the signs of death he felt within him he knew well his\nlife was drawing to a close, and therefore he resolved to leave behind\nhim a declaration of the cause of his strange end. He began to write, but\nbefore he had put down all he meant to say, his breath failed him and he\nyielded up his life, a victim to the suffering which his ill-advised\ncuriosity had entailed upon him. The master of the house observing that\nit was now late and that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and\nascertain if his indisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his\nface, his body partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which\nhe lay with the written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having\nfirst called to him without receiving any answer, his host approached\nhim, and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he\nwas dead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to\nwitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the\npaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which contained\nthese words:\n\n\"A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of\nmy death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive\nher, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have\nrequired her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my own\ndishonour, there is no reason why-\"\n\nSo far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,\nbefore he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The\nnext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives, who\nhad already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent where\nCamilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on that\ninevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death, but\nbecause of those she received of her lover's departure. Although she saw\nherself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the convent or\ntake the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her that\nLothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had been\nrecently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova in\nthe kingdom of Naples, whither her too late repentant lover had repaired.\nOn learning this Camilla took the veil, and shortly afterwards died, worn\nout by grief and melancholy. This was the end of all three, an end that\ncame of a thoughtless beginning.\n\n\"I like this novel,\" said the curate; \"but I cannot persuade myself of\nits truth; and if it has been invented, the author's invention is faulty,\nfor it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a\ncostly experiment as Anselmo's. If it had been represented as occurring\nbetween a gallant and his mistress it might pass; but between husband and\nwife there is something of an impossibility about it. As to the way in\nwhich the story is told, however, I have no fault to find.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN\n\n\nJust at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the\ninn, exclaimed, \"Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here we\nmay say gaudeamus.\"\n\n\"What are they?\" said Cardenio.\n\n\"Four men,\" said the landlord, \"riding a la jineta, with lances and\nbucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in\nwhite on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants on\nfoot.\"\n\n\"Are they very near?\" said the curate.\n\n\"So near,\" answered the landlord, \"that here they come.\"\n\nHearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don\nQuixote's room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole party\nthe host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on\nhorseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and\ncame forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and one\nof them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at the\nentrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this time\nneither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word, only on\nsitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms\nfall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot then led the\nhorses away to the stable. Observing this the curate, curious to know who\nthese people in such a dress and preserving such silence were, went to\nwhere the servants were standing and put the question to one of them, who\nanswered him.\n\n\"Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to be\npeople of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady you\nsaw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect, and\nnothing is done except what he directs and orders.\"\n\n\"And the lady, who is she?\" asked the curate.\n\n\"That I cannot tell you either,\" said the servant, \"for I have not seen\nher face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter\nsuch groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it\nis no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade\nand I have only been in their company two days, for having met us on the\nroad they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia,\npromising to pay us well.\"\n\n\"And have you heard any of them called by his name?\" asked the curate.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied the servant; \"they all preserve a marvellous\nsilence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except the\npoor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel sure that\nwherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as far as one\ncan judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more likely, about to\nbecome one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her own\nfree will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to be.\"\n\n\"That may well be,\" said the curate, and leaving them he returned to\nwhere Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural\ncompassion drew near to her and said, \"What are you suffering from,\nsenora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to\nrelieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.\"\n\nTo this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated her\noffers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman with\nthe veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, approached and\nsaid to Dorothea, \"Do not give yourself the trouble, senora, of making\nany offers to that woman, for it is her way to give no thanks for\nanything that is done for her; and do not try to make her answer unless\nyou want to hear some lie from her lips.\"\n\n\"I have never told a lie,\" was the immediate reply of her who had been\nsilent until now; \"on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and so\nignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition; and\nthis I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that\nhas made you false and a liar.\"\n\nCardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to\nthe speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote's room between\nthem, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,\n\"Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my\nears?\" Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing the\nspeaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which the\ngentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. In her\nagitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her\nface fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and marvellous\nbeauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her eyes, everywhere\nshe could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made her look as if she\nhad lost her senses, and so marked that it excited the pity of Dorothea\nand all who beheld her, though they knew not what caused it. The\ngentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully\noccupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil\nwhich was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who\nwas holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who\nlikewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she\nrecognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of\nher heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being\nclose by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to\nthe ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw\nwater on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the\nother in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the\nsight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that\nwas struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised\nCardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard\nDorothea's cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his\nLuscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw\nwas Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew\nCardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood\nin silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.\n\nThey gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don\nFernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio. The\nfirst to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don Fernando:\n\"Leave me, Senor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself;\nif no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of\nwhich I am the ivy, to the support from which neither your importunities,\nnor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts have been able to\ndetach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden from our sight, has\nbrought me face to face with my true husband; and well you know by\ndear-bought experience that death alone will be able to efface him from\nmy memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead you, as you can do\nnothing else, to turn your love into rage, your affection into\nresentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up in the presence\nof my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may be by my death he\nwill be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the last moment of\nlife.\"\n\nMeanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words,\nby means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando\ndid not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as\nwell as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of\nbright and touching tears addressed him thus:\n\n\"If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine\narms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen by\nthis time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt have\nit so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly peasant girl\nwhom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough\nto call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a\ncontented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true and\ntender passion, as it seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty and\nsurrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift received by thee but\nthanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place where\nthou dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in which\nI see thee. Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that I have come\nhere driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself\nforgotten by thee that have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and\nthou didst so follow thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou\ncanst not help being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable\naffection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for\nwhich thou wouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's\nbecause thou art mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio's;\nand it will be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores\nthee, than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst\naddress thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou\nwert not ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly\nto thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception,\nand if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a\ngentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy\nat last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I\nam, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,\nfor so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not\nby deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the\nstreets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal\nservices they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not\ndeserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy blood\nto mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no nobility in\nthe world that has not travelled the same road, and that in illustrious\nlineages it is not the woman's blood that is of account; and, moreover,\nthat true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art wanting in that,\nrefusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I have higher claims\nto nobility than thine. To make an end, senor, these are my last words to\nthee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy wife; witness thy words,\nwhich must not and ought not to be false, if thou dost pride thyself on\nthat for want of which thou scornest me; witness the pledge which thou\ndidst give me, and witness Heaven, which thou thyself didst call to\nwitness the promise thou hadst made me; and if all this fail, thy own\nconscience will not fail to lift up its silent voice in the midst of all\nthy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what I say and mar thy highest\npleasure and enjoyment.\"\n\nAll this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest\nfeeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don\nFernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened to\nher without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such sobs\nand sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened\nby the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her with no\nless compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence\nand beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words of comfort to\nher, but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held her fast. He,\noverwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for\nsome moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda,\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is\nimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths.\"\n\nLuscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground when\nDon Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreated\nbehind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside and\nregardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and said as\nhe clasped her in his arms, \"If Heaven in its compassion is willing to\nlet thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair,\nnowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive\nthee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to call thee\nmine.\"\n\nAt these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to\nrecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that\nit was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\nconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and\npressing her face close to his, said, \"Yes, my dear lord, you are the\ntrue master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again,\nand fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\"\n\nA strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,\nfilled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied\nthat Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take\nvengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;\nand the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she clasped\nhim round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to prevent\nhis moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, \"What is it thou\nwouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou hast thy wife\nat thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms\nof her husband: reflect whether it will be right for thee, whether it\nwill be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has done, or whether it\nwill be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be thy mate who in spite\nof every obstacle, and strong in her truth and constancy, is before thine\neyes, bathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her lawful\nhusband. For God's sake I entreat of thee, for thine own I implore thee,\nlet not this open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as\nto allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any\ninterference from thee so long as Heaven permits them; and in so doing\nthou wilt prove the generosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world\nshall see that with thee reason has more influence than passion.\"\n\nAll the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda in\nhis arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he saw him\nmake any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best\nhe could all who might assail him, though it should cost him his life.\nBut now Don Fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who\nhad been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza,\nran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him to have\nregard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to\nbe disappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she said was but\nthe truth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem, by\naccident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had all\nmet in a place where no one could have expected a meeting. And the curate\nbade him remember that only death could part Luscinda from Cardenio; that\neven if some sword were to separate them they would think their death\nmost happy; and that in a case that admitted of no remedy his wisest\ncourse was, by conquering and putting a constraint upon himself, to show\na generous mind, and of his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the\nhappiness Heaven had granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon\nthe beauty of Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much\nless excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\nsurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him that\nif he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he could not\ndo otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he would\nobey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and\nrecognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth,\nprovided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of\nany rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with\nhimself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts\nitself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he is not to be\nblamed who gives way to it.\n\nTo be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don\nFernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was\ntouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he could\nnot gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the good\nadvice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and embracing\nDorothea, saying to her, \"Rise, dear lady, it is not right that what I\nhold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I have\nshown no sign of what I own, it may have been by Heaven's decree in order\nthat, seeing the constancy with which you love me, I may learn to value\nyou as you deserve. What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not\nwith my transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and\nforce that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against\nbeing yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now\nhappy Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and\nas she has found and gained the object of her desires, and I have found\nin you what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and\ncontentment as many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray\nHeaven to allow me to live with my Dorothea;\" and with these words he\nonce more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so much\ntenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from\ncompleting the proof of his love and repentance in the sight of all. Not\nso Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so\nmany tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that\none would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even\nSancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because\nhe saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom\nhe expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping\nlasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their\nknees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had\nrendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer\nthem, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and\ncourtesy.\n\nHe then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far\nremoved from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that\nshe had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his\ncompanions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer;\nso charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had\nfinished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after\nhe had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared that she\nwas Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill\nher, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and\nthat he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge\nhimself when a more convenient opportunity should offer. The next day he\nlearned that Luscinda had disappeared from her father's house, and that\nno one could tell whither she had gone. Finally, at the end of some\nmonths he ascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there\nall the rest of her life, if she were not to share it with Cardenio; and\nas soon as he had learned this, taking these three gentlemen as his\ncompanions, he arrived at the place where she was, but avoided speaking\nto her, fearing that if it were known he was there stricter precautions\nwould be taken in the convent; and watching a time when the porter's\nlodge was open he left two to guard the gate, and he and the other\nentered the convent in quest of Luscinda, whom they found in the\ncloisters in conversation with one of the nuns, and carrying her off\nwithout giving her time to resist, they reached a place with her where\nthey provided themselves with what they required for taking her away; all\nwhich they were able to do in complete safety, as the convent was in the\ncountry at a considerable distance from the city. He added that when\nLuscinda found herself in his power she lost all consciousness, and after\nreturning to herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a\nword; and thus in silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him\nwas reaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an\nend.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH\nOTHER DROLL ADVENTURES\n\n\nTo all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his\nhopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the\nfair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don\nFernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious\nof all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself\nthat her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar\nstate of mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in the same direction. Don\nFernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having\nbeen rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so\nnear the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short\neverybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the\nhappy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a\nsensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and\ncongratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the\nhighest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise\nCardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and\ndamage she had sustained through Don Quixote's means. Sancho, as has been\nalready said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected;\nand so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you\nlike, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her\nkingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\"\n\n\"I should think it was,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for I have had the most\nprodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember\nhaving had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke-swish!--I\nbrought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth\nfrom him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\"\n\n\"Like red wine, your worship had better say,\" replied Sancho; \"for I\nwould have you know, if you don't know it, that the dead giant is a\nhacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that\nit had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and\nthe devil take it all.\"\n\n\"What art thou talking about, fool?\" said Don Quixote; \"art thou in thy\nsenses?\"\n\n\"Let your worship get up,\" said Sancho, \"and you will see the nice\nbusiness you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see\nthe queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things\nthat will astonish you, if you understand them.\"\n\n\"I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\" returned Don Quixote;\n\"for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that\neverything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would\nbe no wonder if it were the same now.\"\n\n\"I could believe all that,\" replied Sancho, \"if my blanketing was the\nsame sort of thing also; only it wasn't, but real and genuine; for I saw\nthe landlord, Who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and\njerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much\nlaughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I\nhold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment\nabout it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\"\n\n\"Well, well, God will give a remedy,\" said Don Quixote; \"hand me my\nclothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and\nthings thou speakest of.\"\n\nSancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate\ngave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote's\nmadness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from\nthat Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady's\nscorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho\nhad mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking\nit, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be\ncapable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea's good\nfortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be\nnecessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home.\n\nCardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested\nthat Luscinda would act and support Dorothea's part sufficiently well.\n\n\"No,\" said Don Fernando, \"that must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow\nout this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman's village is not very\nfar off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.\"\n\n\"It is not more than two days' journey from this,\" said the curate.\n\n\"Even if it were more,\" said Don Fernando, \"I would gladly travel so far\nfor the sake of doing so good a work.\n\n\"At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's\nhelmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and\nleaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled Don\nFernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow\nface half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of\nhis deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and\nhe, fixing his eyes on the air Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity\nand composure:\n\n\"I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been\nannihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of\nhigh degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private\nmaiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king your\nfather, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and\nare entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half\nthe mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he had\nread and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I have, he\nwould have found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine have\naccomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelp\nof a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since I\nmyself was engaged with one, and-I will not speak of it, that they may\nnot say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell the tale\nwhen we least expect it.\"\n\n\"You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,\" said the\nlandlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and on no\naccount interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, \"I say in conclusion, high\nand disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about this\nmetamorphosis in your person for the reason I have mentioned, you ought\nnot to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth\nthrough which my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many\ndays are over, I will bring your enemy's head to the ground and place on\nyours the crown of your kingdom.\"\n\nDon Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who\naware of Don Fernando's determination to carry on the deception until Don\nQuixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner and\ngravity made answer, \"Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation did not\ntell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is true that\ncertain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than I could\nhave hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not therefore\nceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same desire I have\nhad all through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and\ninvincible arm. And so, senor, let your goodness reinstate the father\nthat begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he was a wise and\nprudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of\nremedying my misfortune; for I believe, senor, that had it not been for\nyou I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in\nthis I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who\nare present can fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our\njourney to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the\nrest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I trust to God and the\nvalour of your heart.\"\n\nSo said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned to\nSancho, and said to him, with an angry air, \"I declare now, little\nSancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and\nvagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been\nturned into a maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am\npersuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and other\nnonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever been in all\nmy life? I vow\" (and here he looked to heaven and ground his teeth) \"I\nhave a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way that will teach\nsense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"Let your worship be calm, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"for it may well be\nthat I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess\nMicomicona; but as to the giant's head, or at least as to the piercing of\nthe wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sure\nas there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head of\nyour worship's bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you\nwill see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the\nlandlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that\nher ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as\nanyone.\"\n\n\"I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,\" said Don Quixote; \"forgive\nme, and that will do.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Don Fernando; \"let us say no more about it; and as\nher ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is too\nlate to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant\nconversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Senor Don Quixote; for\nwe wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is about\nto perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has\nundertaken.\"\n\n\"It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,\" said Don Quixote; \"and I\nam much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the good\nopinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it shall\ncost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.\"\n\nMany were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed\nbetween Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end by\na traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his\nattire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors, for\nhe was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves\nand without a collar; his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap\nof the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass\nslung from a baldric across his breast. Behind him, mounted upon an ass,\nthere came a woman dressed in Moorish fashion, with her face veiled and a\nscarf on her head, and wearing a little brocaded cap, and a mantle that\ncovered her from her shoulders to her feet. The man was of a robust and\nwell-proportioned frame, in age a little over forty, rather swarthy in\ncomplexion, with long moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his\nappearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have been\ntaken for a person of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a\nroom, and when they told him there was none in the inn he seemed\ndistressed, and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor he\nher down from saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her\ndaughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely\nnew costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,\ncourteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who had\nbrought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, \"Do not be\nput out, senora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here, for it is\nthe way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will be\npleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda) perhaps you\nwill have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.\"\n\nTo this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her\nseat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending her\nbody as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they concluded\nthat she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian tongue.\n\nAt this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise\nengaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that she\nmade no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, \"Ladies, this\ndamsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of her\nown country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what has\nbeen asked of her.\"\n\n\"Nothing has been asked of her,\" returned Luscinda; \"she has only been\noffered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we\noccupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances\nallow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand\nin need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is\nrendered.\"\n\n\"On her part and my own, senora,\" replied the captive, \"I kiss your\nhands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,\nwhich, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,\nis, it is plain to see, a very great one.\"\n\n\"Tell me, senor,\" said Dorothea, \"is this lady a Christian or a Moor? for\nher dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could\nwish she was not.\"\n\n\"In dress and outwardly,\" said he, \"she is a Moor, but at heart she is a\nthoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become\none.\"\n\n\"Then she has not been baptised?\" returned Luscinda.\n\n\"There has been no opportunity for that,\" replied the captive, \"since she\nleft Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present she has\nnot found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it\nnecessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the\nceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she\nshall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than\nher dress or mine indicates.\"\n\nBy these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who the\nMoorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then,\nseeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves\nthan for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took the Moorish\nlady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested her\nto remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to ask him what they\nmeant and what she was to do. He said to her in Arabic that they asked\nher to take off her veil, and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a\ncountenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful than\nLuscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the\nbystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the\nMoorish lady's, and there were even those who were inclined to give it\nsomewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty\nto win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show\nkindness and attention to the lovely Moor.\n\nDon Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that it\nwas Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what the\nChristian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy,\n\"No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\" giving them to understand that she was\ncalled \"Maria\" and not \"Zoraida.\" These words, and the touching\nearnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from\nsome of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature\ntender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,\nsaying, \"Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,\" to which the Moor replied, \"Yes, yes,\nMaria; Zoraida macange,\" which means \"not Zoraida.\"\n\nNight was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don\nFernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the\nbest supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they\nall took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or\nsquare table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the\nhead of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote,\nwho desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was\nher protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite\nto them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the\nother gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the\nbarber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when\nthey observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like\nthat which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with\nthe goatherds, begin to address them:\n\n\"Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the\nthings they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.\nSay, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this\ncastle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or\nimagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside\nme was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of\nFame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all\nthose that mankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held\nin honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with\nthose who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell\nthem, whosoever they may be, that they know not what they say. For the\nreason which such persons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly\nrest, is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the\nbody, and that arms give employment to the body alone; as if the calling\nwere a porter's trade, for which nothing more is required than sturdy\nstrength; or as if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not\nincluded acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is\nrequisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army, or the\ndefence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much by mind as\nby body. Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or\ndivine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles,\nor to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the\nmind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms\nhave need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the\ntwo minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to\ndo; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain;\nfor that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler\nobject. The end and goal of letters--I am not speaking now of divine\nletters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for\nwith an end so infinite no other can be compared--I speak of human\nletters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to\nevery man that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are\nobserved: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise,\nbut not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for\ntheir end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this\nlife. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which\nthe angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in the\nair, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\ngood-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and earth\ntaught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house,\nwas to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he said to\nthem, 'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be with\nyou;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a jewel\nwithout which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven.\nThis peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name for arms.\nThis, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and that so far\nit has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to the bodily\nlabours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows the\nprofession of arms, and see which are the greater.\"\n\nDon Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correct\nlanguage, that for the time being he made it impossible for any of his\nhearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were mostly\ngentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to\nhim with great pleasure as he continued: \"Here, then, I say is what the\nstudent has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, but\nto put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that he\nendures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about his hard\nfortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things of life. This\npoverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness,\nor all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets\nsomething to eat, though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and\nfrom the leavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is\nwhat they themselves call 'going out for soup,' and there is always some\nneighbour's brazier or hearth for them, which, if it does not warm, at\nleast tempers the cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at\nnight under a roof. I will not go into other particulars, as for example\nwant of shirts, and no superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare\ngarments, and gorging themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good\nluck has treated them to a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have\ndescribed, rough and hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up\nagain to fall again, they reach the rank they desire, and that once\nattained, we have seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and\nCharybdises, as if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we\nhave seen them, I say, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their\nhunger turned into satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into\nfine raiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the\njustly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with\nwhat the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of\nit, as I am now about to show.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND\nLETTERS\n\n\nContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: \"As we began in the student's\ncase with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier\nis richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one\npoorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or\nnever, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling his life and\nconscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed\ndoublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he\nhas to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open\nfield with nothing better than the breath of his mouth, which I need not\nsay, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws\nof nature. To be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make\nup for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, which, unless by\nsome fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easily\nmeasure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to\nhis heart's content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from\nhim. Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree\nin his calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived,\nwhen they invest him with the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some\nbullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him with\na crippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven\nwatches over him and keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in\nthe same poverty he was in before, and he must go through more\nengagements and more battles, and come victorious out of all before he\nbetters himself; but miracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me,\nsirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have\ngained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it?\nNo doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead\ncannot be numbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed\nup with three figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of\nletters; for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of\nsupport; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is\nmuch less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to\nreward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving\nthem places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling,\nwhile the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the\nmaster they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.\n\n\"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it\nis difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of arms\nover letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put\nforward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say\nthat without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its\nlaws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters\nand men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them laws\ncannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms\npreserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;\nand, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,\ncities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and\nconfusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to\nmake use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that whatever\ncosts most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain to\neminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,\nheadaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I\nhave already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course of\nthings to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and in an\nincomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of losing\nhis life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the\nstudent can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds himself\nbeleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or\ncavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where\nhe is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from\nthe imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform his\ncaptain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a\ncounter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the\nmoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into\nthe deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see\nwhether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem\nto stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the\nother, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the\nplank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him as\nmany ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him,\nnot a lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first\nheedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune's\nbosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he\nmakes himself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that\nnarrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is still more marvellous, no\nsooner has one gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the\nend of the world, than another takes his place; and if he too falls into\nthe sea that waits for him like an enemy, another and another will\nsucceed him without a moment's pause between their deaths: courage and\ndaring the greatest that all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest\nages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery,\nwhose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his\ndiabolical invention, by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly\narm to take the life of a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not\nhow or whence, in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and\nanimate brave hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged\nperhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his\naccursed machine, which in an instant puts an end to the projects and\ncuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus\nwhen I reflect on this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I\nrepent of having adopted this profession of knight-errant in so\ndetestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me\nfear, still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may\nrob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout\nthe known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But\nHeaven's will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more\nhonoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore\nexposed themselves to.\"\n\nAll this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped,\nforgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than once\ntold him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to\nsay all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to\nsee a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every\nsubject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched\nunlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right\nin all he had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man\nof letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion.\n\nThey finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess,\nher daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha's\ngarret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be\nquartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to\ntell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and\ninteresting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in\ncompany with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he would very\nwillingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale would not give\nthem as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in\ncompliance, he would tell it. The curate and the others thanked him and\nadded their entreaties, and he finding himself so pressed said there was\nno occasion ask, where a command had such weight, and added, \"If your\nworships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which,\nperhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art\ncannot come up to.\" These words made them settle themselves in their\nplaces and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his\nwords in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nWHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES\n\n\nMy family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and\nnature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in\nthe general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even\na rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever in\npreserving his property as he was in spending it. This tendency of his to\nbe liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his\nyouth, for the soldier's life is a school in which the niggard becomes\nfree-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to be\nfound who are misers, they are monsters of rare occurrence. My father\nwent beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a disposition by no\nmeans advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his\nname and position. My father had three, all sons, and all of sufficient\nage to make choice of a profession. Finding, then, that he was unable to\nresist his propensity, he resolved to divest himself of the instrument\nand cause of his prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth,\nwithout which Alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so\ncalling us all three aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words\nsomewhat to the following effect:\n\n\"My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said\nthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not\nlove you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no\nself-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;\ntherefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a\nfather, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do\nwith you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature\ndeliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of\nlife or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour and\nprofit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to divide my\nproperty into four parts; three I will give to you, to each his portion\nwithout making any difference, and the other I will retain to live upon\nand support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven may be pleased\nto grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possession of the share\nthat falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall indicate. In this\nSpain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very true--as they all are,\nbeing short aphorisms drawn from long practical experience--and the one I\nrefer to says, 'The church, or the sea, or the king's house;' as much as\nto say, in plainer language, whoever wants to flourish and become rich,\nlet him follow the church, or go to sea, adopting commerce as his\ncalling, or go into the king's service in his household, for they say,\n'Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.' I say so because it is my\nwill and pleasure that one of you should follow letters, another trade,\nand the third serve the king in the wars, for it is a difficult matter to\ngain admission to his service in his household, and if war does not bring\nmuch wealth it confers great distinction and fame. Eight days hence I\nwill give you your full shares in money, without defrauding you of a\nfarthing, as you will see in the end. Now tell me if you are willing to\nfollow out my idea and advice as I have laid it before you.\"\n\nHaving called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not to\nstrip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for we\nwere young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with his\nwishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and\nthereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the same\nproposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion that\nfell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said he\nwould rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies at\nSalamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice of\nour professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time he\nmentioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had given\nto each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand ducats\napiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it\ndown, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the same day\ntook leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it seemed to me\ninhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age, I\ninduced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the remainder\nwould be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. My two brothers,\nmoved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so that there was\nleft for my father four thousand ducats in money, besides three thousand,\nthe value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain in\nland instead of selling it. Finally, as I said, we took leave of him, and\nof our uncle whom I have mentioned, not without sorrow and tears on both\nsides, they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offered\nhow we fared, whether well or ill. We promised to do so, and when he had\nembraced us and given us his blessing, one set out for Salamanca, the\nother for Seville, and I for Alicante, where I had heard there was a\nGenoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa.\n\nIt is now some twenty-two years since I left my father's house, and all\nthat time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news\nwhatever of him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period I\nwill now relate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after a\nprosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided myself\nwith arms and a few soldier's accoutrements; thence it was my intention\nto go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already on the road to\nAlessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of Alva was on\nhis way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, served under him in\nthe campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the Counts Egmont and\nHorn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous captain of\nGuadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my arrival in\nFlanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius V of happy\nmemory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common enemy, the\nTurk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island of Cyprus,\nwhich belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable and disastrous. It was\nknown as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria, natural brother\nof our good king Don Philip, was coming as commander-in-chief of the\nallied forces, and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations\nwhich were being made, all which stirred my heart and filled me with a\nlonging to take part in the campaign which was expected; and though I had\nreason to believe, and almost certain promises, that on the first\nopportunity that presented itself I should be promoted to be captain, I\npreferred to leave all and betake myself, as I did, to Italy; and it was\nmy good fortune that Don John had just arrived at Genoa, and was going on\nto Naples to join the Venetian fleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I\nmay say, in short, that I took part in that glorious expedition, promoted\nby this time to be a captain of infantry, to which honourable charge my\ngood luck rather than my merits raised me; and that day--so fortunate for\nChristendom, because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of\nthe error under which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on\nsea-on that day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were\nbroken, among all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died\nthat day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I\nalone was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have\nexpected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that\nfamous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my\nhands.\n\nIt happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and\nsuccessful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese galley\n(only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly wounded), the\nchief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my company were\nplaced, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do in such a case,\nI leaped on board the enemy's galley, which, sheering off from that which\nhad attacked it, prevented my men from following me, and so I found\nmyself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in such numbers that I\nwas unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered with wounds; El\nUchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with his entire squadron, and\nI was left a prisoner in his power, the only sad being among so many\nfilled with joy, and the only captive among so many free; for there were\nfifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the Turkish fleet, that\nregained their longed-for liberty that day.\n\nThey carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my\nmaster general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried\noff as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta. The\nfollowing year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at\nNavarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns. There I\nsaw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet\nin harbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to\nit made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour,\nand had their kits and pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on\nshore without waiting to be assailed, in so great fear did they stand of\nour fleet. But Heaven ordered it otherwise, not for any fault or neglect\nof the general who commanded on our side, but for the sins of\nChristendom, and because it was God's will and pleasure that we should\nalways have instruments of punishment to chastise us. As it was, El\nUchali took refuge at Modon, which is an island near Navarino, and\nlanding forces fortified the mouth of the harbour and waited quietly\nuntil Don John retired. On this expedition was taken the galley called\nthe Prize, whose captain was a son of the famous corsair Barbarossa. It\nwas taken by the chief Neapolitan galley called the She-wolf, commanded\nby that thunderbolt of war, that father of his men, that successful and\nunconquered captain Don Alvaro de Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I\ncannot help telling you what took place at the capture of the Prize.\n\nThe son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,\nthat, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was\nbearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped\ntheir oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of\nthe gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from\nbench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before he\nhad got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so great, as\nI said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the hatred with\nwhich they hated him.\n\nWe returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three, it\nbecame known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom from\nthe Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to the\nhopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the world,\nentertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the loss\ngreatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess, he\nmade peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than he\nwas), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta and\nthe fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all these\nevents were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any hope of\nfreedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for I was\nfirmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes.\nAt length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before which places there\nwere seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers, and more than four\nhundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of Africa, and in the\ntrain of all this great host such munitions and engines of war, and so\nmany pioneers that with their hands they might have covered the Goletta\nand the fort with handfuls of earth. The first to fall was the Goletta,\nuntil then reckoned impregnable, and it fell, not by any fault of its\ndefenders, who did all that they could and should have done, but because\nexperiment proved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert\nsand there; for water used to be found at two palms depth, while the\nTurks found none at two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags\nthey raised their works so high that they commanded the walls of the\nfort, sweeping them as if from a cavalier, so that no one was able to\nmake a stand or maintain the defence.\n\nIt was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up\nin the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the landing-place;\nbut those who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such\nmatters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there were barely seven\nthousand soldiers, how could such a small number, however resolute, sally\nout and hold their own against numbers like those of the enemy? And how\nis it possible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above\nall when surrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country?\nBut many thought, and I thought so too, that it was special favour and\nmercy which Heaven showed to Spain in permitting the destruction of that\nsource and hiding place of mischief, that devourer, sponge, and moth of\ncountless money, fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save\npreserving the memory of its capture by the invincible Charles V; as if\nto make that eternal, as it is and will be, these stones were needed to\nsupport it. The fort also fell; but the Turks had to win it inch by inch,\nfor the soldiers who defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the\nnumber of the enemy killed in twenty-two general assaults exceeded\ntwenty-five thousand. Of three hundred that remained alive not one was\ntaken unwounded, a clear and manifest proof of their gallantry and\nresolution, and how sturdily they had defended themselves and held their\npost. A small fort or tower which was in the middle of the lagoon under\nthe command of Don Juan Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous\nsoldier, capitulated upon terms. They took prisoner Don Pedro\nPuertocarrero, commandant of the Goletta, who had done all in his power\nto defend his fortress, and took the loss of it so much to heart that he\ndied of grief on the way to Constantinople, where they were carrying him\na prisoner. They also took the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon\nby name, a Milanese gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier.\nIn these two fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was\nPagano Doria, knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous\ndisposition, as was shown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the\nfamous John Andrea Doria; and what made his death the more sad was that\nhe was slain by some Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he\nentrusted himself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a\nMoor to Tabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese\nemployed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried\nit to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth of\nour Castilian proverb, that \"though the treason may please, the traitor\nis hated;\" for they say he ordered those who brought him the present to\nbe hanged for not having brought him alive.\n\nAmong the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro\nde Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who\nhad been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare\nintelligence, who had in particular a special gift for what they call\npoetry. I say so because his fate brought him to my galley and to my\nbench, and made him a slave to the same master; and before we left the\nport this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the\nGoletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them, for\nI have them by heart, and I think they will be liked rather than\ndisliked.\n\nThe instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don\nFernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when he\ncame to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \"Before your worship\nproceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don\nPedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\"\n\n\"All I know is,\" replied the captive, \"that after having been in\nConstantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in\ncompany with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I\ncannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the\nGreek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result\nof the journey was.\"\n\n\"Well then, you are right,\" returned the gentleman, \"for that Don Pedro\nis my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich,\nmarried, and with three children.\"\n\n\"Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\" said the\ncaptive; \"for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with\nrecovering lost liberty.\"\n\n\"And what is more,\" said the gentleman, \"I know the sonnets my brother\nmade.\"\n\n\"Then let your worship repeat them,\" said the captive, \"for you will\nrecite them better than I can.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the gentleman; \"that on the Goletta runs thus.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nIN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED.\n\n\nSONNET\n\n\"Blest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free,\n  In guerdon of brave deeds beatified,\n  Above this lowly orb of ours abide\nMade heirs of heaven and immortality,\nWith noble rage and ardour glowing ye\n  Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied,\n  And with your own blood and the foeman's dyed\nThe sandy soil and the encircling sea.\nIt was the ebbing life-blood first that failed\nThe weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.\n  Though vanquished, yet ye earned the victor's crown:\nThough mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall\nFor there ye won, between the sword and wall,\n  In Heaven glory and on earth renown.\"\n\"That is it exactly, according to my recollection,\" said the captive.\n\n\"Well then, that on the fort,\" said the gentleman, \"if my memory serves\nme, goes thus:\n\nSONNET\n\n\"Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell,\n  Whose walls and towers here in ruin lie,\n  Three thousand soldier souls took wing on high,\nIn the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.\nThe onslaught of the foeman to repel\n  By might of arm all vainly did they try,\n  And when at length 'twas left them but to die,\nWearied and few the last defenders fell.\nAnd this same arid soil hath ever been\nA haunt of countless mournful memories,\n  As well in our day as in days of yore.\nBut never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,\nFrom its hard bosom purer souls than these,\n  Or braver bodies on its surface bore.\"\n\nThe sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the\ntidings they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went on\nto say:\n\nThe Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave orders\nto dismantle the Goletta--for the fort was reduced to such a state that\nthere was nothing left to level--and to do the work more quickly and\neasily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able to blow\nup the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is to say, the old\nwalls, while all that remained standing of the new fortifications that\nthe Fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease. Finally\nthe fleet returned victorious and triumphant to Constantinople, and a few\nmonths later died my master, El Uchali, otherwise Uchali Fartax, which\nmeans in Turkish \"the scabby renegade;\" for that he was; it is the\npractice with the Turks to name people from some defect or virtue they\nmay possess; the reason being that there are among them only four\nsurnames belonging to families tracing their descent from the Ottoman\nhouse, and the others, as I have said, take their names and surnames\neither from bodily blemishes or moral qualities. This \"scabby one\" rowed\nat the oar as a slave of the Grand Signor's for fourteen years, and when\nover thirty-four years of age, in resentment at having been struck by a\nTurk while at the oar, turned renegade and renounced his faith in order\nto be able to revenge himself; and such was his valour that, without\nowing his advancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites\nof the Grand Signor rise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and\nafterwards general-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the\nrealm. He was a Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he\ntreated his slaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them,\nand after his death they were divided, as he directed by his will,\nbetween the Grand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the\nchildren of the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a\nVenetian renegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken\nby Uchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most\nfavoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his\nname was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.\nWith him I went there from Constantinople, rather glad to be so near\nSpain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot, but\nto try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than in\nConstantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escape\nwithout ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers I\nresolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose I cherished so\ndearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and when\nin my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my\nexpectations, without giving way to despair I immediately began to look\nout for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint or\nfeeble it might be.\n\nIn this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the\nTurks a bano in which they confine the Christian captives, as well those\nthat are the king's as those belonging to private individuals, and also\nwhat they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to say the\nslaves of the municipality, who serve the city in the public works and\nother employments; but captives of this kind recover their liberty with\ngreat difficulty, for, as they are public property and have no particular\nmaster, there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom, even though\nthey may have the means. To these banos, as I have said, some private\nindividuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their captives,\nespecially when they are to be ransomed; because there they can keep them\nin safety and comfort until their ransom arrives. The king's captives\nalso, that are on ransom, do not go out to work with the rest of the\ncrew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for then, to make them write\nfor it more pressingly, they compel them to work and go for wood, which\nis no light labour.\n\nI, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that I\nwas a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of fortune,\nnothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen and\nthose waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me, more as a mark of\nthis than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in that bano with\nseveral other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held to\nransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we suffered from\nhunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much as hearing and\nseeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of cruelties my master\ninflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged a man, impaled one,\ncut off the ears of another; and all with so little provocation, or so\nentirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he did it merely for\nthe sake of doing it, and because he was by nature murderously disposed\ntowards the whole human race. The only one that fared at all well with\nhim was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra by name, to whom he\nnever gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be given, or addressed a\nhard word, although he had done things that will dwell in the memory of\nthe people there for many a year, and all to recover his liberty; and for\nthe least of the many things he did we all dreaded that he would be\nimpaled, and he himself was in fear of it more than once; and only that\ntime does not allow, I could tell you now something of what that soldier\ndid, that would interest and astonish you much more than the narration of\nmy own tale.\n\nTo go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by the\nwindows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position; and\nthese, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than windows,\nand besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It so\nhappened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison with\nthree other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we could\nleap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other Christians had\ngone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from one of these\nlittle closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the\nend of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as if making signs\nto us to come and take it. We watched it, and one of those who were with\nme went and stood under the reed to see whether they would let it drop,\nor what they would do, but as he did so the reed was raised and moved\nfrom side to side, as if they meant to say \"no\" by a shake of the head.\nThe Christian came back, and it was again lowered, making the same\nmovements as before. Another of my comrades went, and with him the same\nhappened as with the first, and then the third went forward, but with the\nsame result as the first and second. Seeing this I did not like not to\ntry my luck, and as soon as I came under the reed it was dropped and fell\ninside the bano at my feet. I hastened to untie the cloth, in which I\nperceived a knot, and in this were ten cianis, which are coins of base\ngold, current among the Moors, and each worth ten reals of our money.\n\nIt is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not\nless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could\nhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to\ndrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was\nintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the\nterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out\nthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied that\nit must be some woman living in that house that had done us this\nkindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams after\nthe fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and crossing\nthe arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window a small\ncross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This sign led\nus to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the house, and\nthat it was she who had been so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand\nand the bracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea, though we\nthought it might be one of the Christian renegades whom their masters\nvery often take as lawful wives, and gladly, for they prefer them to the\nwomen of their own nation. In all our conjectures we were wide of the\ntruth; so from that time forward our sole occupation was watching and\ngazing at the window where the cross had appeared to us, as if it were\nour pole-star; but at least fifteen days passed without our seeing either\nit or the hand, or any other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured\nwith the utmost pains to ascertain who it was that lived in the house,\nand whether there were any Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever\ntell us anything more than that he who lived there was a rich Moor of\nhigh position, Hadji Morato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an\noffice of high dignity among them. But when we least thought it was going\nto rain any more cianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly\nappear with another cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this\nat a time when, as on the former occasion, the bano was deserted and\nunoccupied.\n\nWe made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I\ndid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it was\nlet drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns with a\npaper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was a large\ncross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned to the\nterrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I made\nsigns that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed. We\nwere all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place; and as\nnone of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know what the\npaper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding some one to\nread it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a native of Murcia,\nwho professed a very great friendship for me, and had given pledges that\nbound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him; for it is the custom\nwith some renegades, when they intend to return to Christian territory,\nto carry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying, in\nwhatever form they can, that such and such a renegade is a worthy man who\nhas always shown kindness to Christians, and is anxious to escape on the\nfirst opportunity that may present itself. Some obtain these testimonials\nwith good intentions, others put them to a cunning use; for when they go\nto pillage on Christian territory, if they chance to be cast away, or\ntaken prisoners, they produce their certificates and say that from these\npapers may be seen the object they came for, which was to remain on\nChristian ground, and that it was to this end they joined the Turks in\ntheir foray. In this way they escape the consequences of the first\noutburst and make their peace with the Church before it does them any\nharm, and then when they have the chance they return to Barbary to become\nwhat they were before. Others, however, there are who procure these\npapers and make use of them honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This\nfriend of mine, then, was one of these renegades that I have described;\nhe had certificates from all our comrades, in which we testified in his\nfavour as strongly as we could; and if the Moors had found the papers\nthey would have burned him alive.\n\nI knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak but\nalso write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I asked\nhim to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a hole in\nmy cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering\nto himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood it, and he\ntold me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to tell me its\nmeaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he might do it\nmore satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required, and he set\nabout translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he said:\n\n\"All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and you\nmust bear in mind that when it says 'Lela Marien' it means 'Our Lady the\nVirgin Mary.'\"\n\nWe read the paper and it ran thus:\n\n\"When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the\nChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela\nMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,\nbut to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me\nto go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great\nlove for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but\nexcept thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and\nbeautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst\ncontrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there,\nand if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien will find\nme some one to marry me. I myself have written this: have a care to whom\nthou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all perfidious. I am\ngreatly troubled on this account, for I would not have thee confide in\nanyone, because if my father knew it he would at once fling me down a\nwell and cover me with stones. I will put a thread to the reed; tie the\nanswer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for thee in Arabic, tell\nit to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me understand thee. She and\nAllah and this cross, which I often kiss as the captive bade me, protect\nthee.\"\n\nJudge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of\nthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade\nperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in\nreality addressed to some one of us, and he begged us, if what he\nsuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would\nrisk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his breast\na metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image\nrepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and\nfaithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose\nto reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her\nwho had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our liberty,\nand he himself obtain the object he so much desired, his restoration to\nthe bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his own sin and\nignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. The renegade said this\nwith so many tears and such signs of repentance, that with one consent we\nall agreed to tell him the whole truth of the matter, and so we gave him\na full account of all, without hiding anything from him. We pointed out\nto him the window at which the reed appeared, and he by that means took\nnote of the house, and resolved to ascertain with particular care who\nlived in it. We agreed also that it would be advisable to answer the\nMoorish lady's letter, and the renegade without a moment's delay took\ndown the words I dictated to him, which were exactly what I shall tell\nyou, for nothing of importance that took place in this affair has escaped\nmy memory, or ever will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer\nreturned to the Moorish lady:\n\n\"The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the\ntrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land\nof the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be\npleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,\nfor she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all\nthese Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for\nthee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou dost\nmean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has given\nus a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well, as thou\nmayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst inform us\nof all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou dost reach the\nland of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee my promise upon\nit as a good Christian; and know that the Christians keep their promises\nbetter than the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother watch over thee, my\nLady.\"\n\nThe paper being written and folded I waited two days until the bano was\nempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the\nterrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long in\nmaking its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not\ndistinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the\nthread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the paper;\nand shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the\nwhite flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I picked it\nup, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all sorts, more\nthan fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our joy and\ndoubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night our renegade\nreturned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been told of lived\nin that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he was enormously\nrich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all his wealth, and\nthat it was the general opinion throughout the city that she was the most\nbeautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of the viceroys who came\nthere had sought her for a wife, but that she had been always unwilling\nto marry; and he had learned, moreover, that she had a Christian slave\nwho was now dead; all which agreed with the contents of the paper. We\nimmediately took counsel with the renegade as to what means would have to\nbe adopted in order to carry off the Moorish lady and bring us all to\nChristian territory; and in the end it was agreed that for the present we\nshould wait for a second communication from Zoraida (for that was the\nname of her who now desires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly\nthat she and no one else could find a way out of all these difficulties.\nWhen we had decided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for\nhe would lose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the bano\nwas filled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance\nfor four days, but at the end of that time, when the bano was, as it\ngenerally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it\npromised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found\nanother paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The\nrenegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,\nwhich was to this effect:\n\n\"I cannot think of a plan, senor, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela\nMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is for\nme to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it ransom\nyourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of the\nChristians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others; and he\nwill find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate near the\nseashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and my\nservants. You can carry me away from there by night without any danger,\nand bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my husband, else\nI will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not trust anyone to\ngo for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I know thou wilt\nreturn more surely than any other, as thou art a gentleman and a\nChristian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with the garden; and when\nI see thee walking yonder I shall know that the bano is empty and I will\ngive thee abundance of money. Allah protect thee, senor.\"\n\nThese were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing\nthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and promised\nto go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made the same\noffer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he would not on\nany account consent to one being set free before all went together, as\nexperience had taught him how ill those who have been set free keep\npromises which they made in captivity; for captives of distinction\nfrequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of one who was to\ngo to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark and\nreturn for the others who had ransomed him, but who never came back; for\nrecovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memory\nall the obligations in the world. And to prove the truth of what he said,\nhe told us briefly what had happened to a certain Christian gentleman\nalmost at that very time, the strangest case that had ever occurred even\nthere, where astonishing and marvellous things are happening every\ninstant. In short, he ended by saying that what could and ought to be\ndone was to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us\nChristians to him, so that he might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers\nunder the pretence of becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along\nthe coast; and when master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit\non some way of getting us all out of the bano and putting us on board;\nespecially if the Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom\nall, because once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us\nto embark even in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the\nMoors do not allow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a\nlarge vessel for going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid\nthat anyone who buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only\nwants it for the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however\nhe could get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him\nin the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and under\ncover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case he\nlooked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my\ncomrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,\nas the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing\nthat if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in\ndanger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with\nZoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore\nresolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's; and\nat the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that we\nwould do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if Lela\nMarien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether we\nwere to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed my\npromise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the bano chanced to\nbe empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed and cloth\ntwo thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that the next\nJuma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father's garden, but\nthat before she went she would give us more money; and if it were not\nenough we were to let her know, as she would give us as much as we asked,\nfor her father had so much he would not miss it, and besides she kept all\nthe keys.\n\nWe at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and\nwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian\nmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me\nreleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship\nfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at\nonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been\nfor a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own\nadvantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal with\nthat I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The Thursday\nbefore the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the garden she\ngave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her departure, begging\nme, if I were ransomed, to find out her father's garden at once, and by\nall means to seek an opportunity of going there to see her. I answered in\na few words that I would do so, and that she must remember to commend us\nto Lela Marien with all the prayers the captive had taught her. This\nhaving been done, steps were taken to ransom our three comrades, so as to\nenable them to quit the bano, and lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves\nnot, though the money was forthcoming, they should make a disturbance\nabout it and the devil should prompt them to do something that might\ninjure Zoraida; for though their position might be sufficient to relieve\nme from this apprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk\nin the matter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was,\nhanding over all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety\nand confidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement\nand secret to him, which might have been dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nIN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURES\n\n\nBefore fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an\nexcellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make the\ntransaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to make, as\nhe did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues from Algiers\non the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in dried figs. Two or\nthree times he made this voyage in company with the Tagarin already\nmentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in Barbary, and those\nof Granada Mudejars; but in the Kingdom of Fez they call the Mudejars\nElches, and they are the people the king chiefly employs in war. To\nproceed: every time he passed with his vessel he anchored in a cove that\nwas not two crossbow shots from the garden where Zoraida was waiting; and\nthere the renegade, together with the two Moorish lads that rowed, used\npurposely to station himself, either going through his prayers, or else\npractising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest. And thus he\nwould go to Zoraida's garden and ask for fruit, which her father gave\nhim, not knowing him; but though, as he afterwards told me, he sought to\nspeak to Zoraida, and tell her who he was, and that by my orders he was\nto take her to the land of the Christians, so that she might feel\nsatisfied and easy, he had never been able to do so; for the Moorish\nwomen do not allow themselves to be seen by any Moor or Turk, unless\ntheir husband or father bid them: with Christian captives they permit\nfreedom of intercourse and communication, even more than might be\nconsidered proper. But for my part I should have been sorry if he had\nspoken to her, for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find her affairs\ntalked of by renegades. But God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no\nopportunity for our renegade's well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how\nsafely he could go to Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and\nwhere he liked, and that the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and\nthat, now I was ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to\nrow, told me to look out for any I should be willing to take with me,\nover and above those who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the\nnext Friday, which he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to\ntwelve Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave\nthe city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because\nthere were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers\nwith them; and these would not have been found were it not that their\nmaster remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to\nfinish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said nothing\nmore than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come out\nstealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting for\nme there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately, with\norders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not to say\nanything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that spot.\n\nThis preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step\nhad to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that she\nmight be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise if we\nwere suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the Christians' vessel\ncould have returned. I determined, therefore, to go to the garden and try\nif I could speak to her; and the day before my departure I went there\nunder the pretence of gathering herbs. The first person I met was her\nfather, who addressed me in the language that all over Barbary and even\nin Constantinople is the medium between captives and Moors, and is\nneither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other nation, but a mixture of\nall languages, by means of which we can all understand one another. In\nthis sort of language, I say, he asked me what I wanted in his garden,\nand to whom I belonged. I replied that I was a slave of the Arnaut Mami\n(for I knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his), and\nthat I wanted some herbs to make a salad. He asked me then whether I were\non ransom or not, and what my master demanded for me. While these\nquestions and answers were proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already\nperceived me some time before, came out of the house in the garden, and\nas Moorish women are by no means particular about letting themselves be\nseen by Christians, or, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no\nhesitation in coming to where her father stood with me; moreover her\nfather, seeing her approaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be\nbeyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred\nair, the brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself\nbefore my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung\nfrom her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her\nhead. On her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes\n(for so bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold,\nset with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued\nthem at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were\nworth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the\nhighest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking themselves\nwith rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are therefore more\namong the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida's father had to the\nreputation of possessing a great number, and the purest in all Algiers,\nand of possessing also more than two hundred thousand Spanish crowns; and\nshe, who is now mistress of me only, was mistress of all this. Whether\nthus adorned she would have been beautiful or not, and what she must have\nbeen in her prosperity, may be imagined from the beauty remaining to her\nafter so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, the beauty of some women\nhas its times and its seasons, and is increased or diminished by chance\ncauses; and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair\nit, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it. In a word she\npresented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour,\nand supremely beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful\nobject I had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her\nI felt as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to\nbring me relief and happiness.\n\nAs she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a\ncaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come for\nsalad.\n\nShe took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have\nspoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed.\n\nI answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might be\nseen what value my master set on me, as I had given one thousand five\nhundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \"Hadst thou been my\nfather's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for\ntwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and\nmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\"\n\n\"That may be, lady,\" said I; \"but indeed I dealt truthfully with my\nmaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.\"\n\n\"And when dost thou go?\" said Zoraida.\n\n\"To-morrow, I think,\" said I, \"for there is a vessel here from France\nwhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better,\" said Zoraida, \"to wait for the arrival of ships\nfrom Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your\nfriends?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now\ncoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it\nis more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return\nto my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me\nto wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be\ndelayed.\"\n\n\"No doubt thou art married in thine own country,\" said Zoraida, \"and for\nthat reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\"\n\n\"I am not married,\" I replied, \"but I have given my promise to marry on\nmy arrival there.\"\n\n\"And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\" said Zoraida.\n\n\"So beautiful,\" said I, \"that, to describe her worthily and tell thee the\ntruth, she is very like thee.\"\n\nAt this her father laughed very heartily and said, \"By Allah, Christian,\nshe must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the most\nbeautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wilt\nsee I am telling the truth.\"\n\nZoraida's father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these\nwords and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language, that, as I\nhave said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more by signs\nthan by words.\n\nWhile we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running up,\nexclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the\ngarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The old\nman was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to\nspeak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the\nsoldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are under\ntheir power that they treat them worse than if they were their slaves.\nHer father said to Zoraida, \"Daughter, retire into the house and shut\nthyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou, Christian, pick\nthy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe to thy own\ncountry.\"\n\nI bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with\nZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her;\nbut the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden, turning to me\nwith her eyes full of tears she said, \"Tameji, cristiano, tameji?\" that is\nto say, \"Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?\"\n\nI made answer, \"Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on the\nwatch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest us; for\nmost surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.\"\n\nThis I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed\nbetween us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble\nsteps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it might\nhave been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered it), just\nas we were moving on in the manner and position I have described, with\nher arm round my neck, her father, as he returned after having sent away\nthe Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived that he saw us; but\nZoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to remove her arm from my\nneck, but on the contrary drew closer to me and laid her head on my\nbreast, bending her knees a little and showing all the signs and tokens\nof fainting, while I at the same time made it seem as though I were\nsupporting her against my will. Her father came running up to where we\nwere, and seeing his daughter in this state asked what was the matter\nwith her; she, however, giving no answer, he said, \"No doubt she has\nfainted in alarm at the entrance of those dogs,\" and taking her from mine\nhe drew her to his own breast, while she sighing, her eyes still wet with\ntears, said again, \"Ameji, cristiano, ameji\"--\"Go, Christian, go.\" To\nthis her father replied, \"There is no need, daughter, for the Christian\nto go, for he has done thee no harm, and the Turks have now gone; feel no\nalarm, there is nothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the Turks at my\nrequest have gone back the way they came.\"\n\n\"It was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, senor,\" said I to her\nfather; \"but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease her:\npeace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this garden\nfor herbs if need be, for my master says there are nowhere better herbs\nfor salad then here.\"\n\n\"Come back for any thou hast need of,\" replied Hadji Morato; \"for my\ndaughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any\nChristian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that it\nwas time for thee to look for thy herbs.\"\n\nWith this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as though her\nheart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending to look\nfor herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied\ncarefully all the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the house\nand everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task easy.\n\nHaving done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place to\nthe renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to the\nhour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession of the\nprize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely Zoraida. The\ntime passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed for arrived;\nand, all following out the arrangement and plan which, after careful\nconsideration and many a long discussion, we had decided upon, we\nsucceeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday following\nthe day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the renegade\nanchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot where she was.\nThe Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding in different\nplaces round about, all waiting for me, anxious and elated, and eager to\nattack the vessel they had before their eyes; for they did not know the\nrenegade's plan, but expected that they were to gain their liberty by\nforce of arms and by killing the Moors who were on board the vessel. As\nsoon, then, as I and my comrades made our appearance, all those that were\nin hiding seeing us came and joined us. It was now the time when the city\ngates are shut, and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside.\nWhen we were collected together we debated whether it would be better\nfirst to go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers who\nrowed in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade came\nup asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors were\noff their guard and most of them asleep. We told him why we hesitated,\nbut he said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel, which\ncould be done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and then we\ncould go for Zoraida. We all approved of what he said, and so without\nfurther delay, guided by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on\nboard first, drew his cutlass and said in Morisco, \"Let no one stir from\nthis if he does not want it to cost him his life.\" By this almost all the\nChristians were on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing\ntheir captain speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them\ntaking to his arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted\nwithout saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured\nthem, threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would\nbe all put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of our\nparty being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking\nthe renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato's garden, and as\ngood luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it\nhad not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we reached the\nhouse without being perceived by anybody. The lovely Zoraida was watching\nfor us at a window, and as soon as she perceived that there were people\nthere, she asked in a low voice if we were \"Nizarani,\" as much as to say\nor ask if we were Christians. I answered that we were, and begged her to\ncome down. As soon as she recognised me she did not delay an instant, but\nwithout answering a word came down immediately, opened the door and\npresented herself before us all, so beautiful and so richly attired that\nI cannot attempt to describe her. The moment I saw her I took her hand\nand kissed it, and the renegade and my two comrades did the same; and the\nrest, who knew nothing of the circumstances, did as they saw us do, for\nit only seemed as if we were returning thanks to her, and recognising her\nas the giver of our liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco\nlanguage if her father was in the house. She replied that he was and that\nhe was asleep.\n\n\"Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,\" said the\nrenegade, \"and everything of value in this fair mansion.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said she, \"my father must not on any account be touched, and there\nis nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will be quite\nenough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall\nsee,\" and so saying she went in, telling us she would return immediately\nand bidding us keep quiet making any noise.\n\nI asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me, I\ndeclared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishes\nof Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crowns\nthat she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father awoke while\nthis was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the window,\nand at once perceiving that all those who were there were Christians,\nraising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call out in Arabic,\n\"Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!\" by which cries we were all\nthrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but the renegade seeing\nthe danger we were in and how important it was for him to effect his\npurpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost quickness to where\nHadji Morato was, and with him went some of our party; I, however, did\nnot dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost fainting in my arms. To\nbe brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an\ninstant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with his hands bound and a\nnapkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him from uttering a word,\nwarning him at the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his\nlife. When his daughter caught sight of him she covered her eyes so as\nnot to see him, and her father was horror-stricken, not knowing how\nwillingly she had placed herself in our hands. But it was now most\nessential for us to be on the move, and carefully and quickly we regained\nthe vessel, where those who had remained on board were waiting for us in\napprehension of some mishap having befallen us. It was barely two hours\nafter night set in when we were all on board the vessel, where the cords\nwere removed from the hands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his\nmouth; but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they\nwould take his life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh\npiteously, and still more when he perceived that I held her closely\nembraced and that she lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or\nshowing any reluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should\ncarry into effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.\n\nFinding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with the\noars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound, bade\nthe renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors and\nsetting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself in the\nsea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away\ncaptive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade repeated this to\nme, and I replied that I was very willing to do so; but he replied that\nit was not advisable, because if they were left there they would at once\nraise the country and stir up the city, and lead to the despatch of swift\ncruisers in pursuit, and our being taken, by sea or land, without any\npossibility of escape; and that all that could be done was to set them\nfree on the first Christian ground we reached. On this point we all\nagreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was explained, together with the reasons\nthat prevented us from doing at once what she desired, was satisfied\nlikewise; and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of our\nstout rowers took his oar, and commending ourselves to God with all our\nhearts, we began to shape our course for the island of Majorca, the\nnearest Christian land. Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a\nlittle, and the sea growing somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to\nkeep a straight course for Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the\ndirection of Oran, not without great uneasiness on our part lest we\nshould be observed from the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast,\nnot more than sixty miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of\nmeeting on that course one of the galliots that usually come with goods\nfrom Tetuan; although each of us for himself and all of us together felt\nconfident that, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were\nnot a cruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we should take a\nvessel in which we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued\nour course Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her\nfather, and I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.\n\nWe might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three\nmusket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without\nanyone to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a\nlittle to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about\ntwo leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we ate something,\nfor the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was not a time\nto take any rest; let food be served out to those who were not rowing,\nbut they would not leave their oars on any account. This was done, but\nnow a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us to leave off rowing\nand make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it was impossible to make\nany other course. All this was done very promptly, and under sail we ran\nmore than eight miles an hour without any fear, except that of coming\nacross some vessel out on a roving expedition. We gave the Moorish rowers\nsome food, and the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were\nnot held as captives, as we should set them free on the first\nopportunity.\n\nThe same was said to Zoraida's father, who replied, \"Anything else,\nChristian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and good\nbehaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me\nmy liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger of\ndepriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially as\nyou know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it;\nand if you will only name that, I here offer you all you require for\nmyself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone, for she\nis the greatest and most precious part of my soul.\"\n\nAs he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with\ncompassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him\nweeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her\narms round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to such\nan outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep them\ncompany.\n\nBut when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about\nher, he said to her in his own language, \"What means this, my daughter?\nLast night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged\nbefell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now,\nwithout having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee\nany joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking\nthyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power\nto give thee when fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this; for it\ncauses me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune itself.\"\n\nThe renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,\nhowever, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner of\nthe vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which\nhe well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden, he\nwas still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into our\nhands, and what there was in it. To which the renegade, without waiting\nfor Zoraida to reply, made answer, \"Do not trouble thyself by asking thy\ndaughter Zoraida so many questions, senor, for the one answer I will give\nthee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she is a Christian,\nand that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer\nfrom captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I imagine, to\nfind herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the\nlight, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.\"\n\n\"Daughter, is this true, what he says?\" cried the Moor.\n\n\"It is,\" replied Zoraida.\n\n\"That thou art in truth a Christian,\" said the old man, \"and that thou\nhast given thy father into the power of his enemies?\"\n\nTo which Zoraida made answer, \"A Christian I am, but it is not I who have\nplaced thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or\ndo thee harm, but only to do good to myself.\"\n\n\"And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?\" said he.\n\n\"Ask thou that,\" said she, \"of Lela Marien, for she can tell thee better\nthan I.\"\n\nThe Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he\nflung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have\nbeen drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a\nlittle on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save\nhim, and we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew him\nin half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress\nthat she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were\nalready dead. We turned him upon his face and he voided a great quantity\nof water, and at the end of two hours came to himself. Meanwhile, the\nwind having changed we were compelled to head for the land, and ply our\noars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our good fortune to reach\na creek that lies on one side of a small promontory or cape, called by\nthe Moors that of the \"Cava rumia,\" which in our language means \"the\nwicked Christian woman;\" for it is a tradition among them that La Cava,\nthrough whom Spain was lost, lies buried at that spot; \"cava\" in their\nlanguage meaning \"wicked woman,\" and \"rumia\" \"Christian;\" moreover, they\ncount it unlucky to anchor there when necessity compels them, and they\nnever do so otherwise. For us, however, it was not the resting-place of\nthe wicked woman but a haven of safety for our relief, so much had the\nsea now got up. We posted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out\nof our hands, and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring\nGod and Our Lady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we\nmight give a happy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty\nof Zoraida orders were given to set on shore her father and the other\nMoors who were still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her\ntender heart bear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen\nprisoners before her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of\ndeparture, for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at\nthat place.\n\nOur prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for after\na while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm, inviting\nus once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing this we\nunbound the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which they were\nfilled with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida's father, who had\nnow completely recovered his senses, he said:\n\n\"Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced at\nyour giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection she\nbears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presence\noffers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it is her\nbelief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change her\nreligion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more freely\npractised in your country than in ours.\" Then turning to Zoraida, while I\nand another of the Christians held him fast by both arms, lest he should\ndo some mad act, he said to her, \"Infamous girl, misguided maiden,\nwhither in thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these\ndogs, our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed\nthe luxury and indulgence in which I reared thee!\"\n\nBut seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him\non shore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations\naloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound\nus, to make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail,\nwe could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he\nplucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground.\nBut once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear\nwhat he said. \"Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive\nthee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come\nback to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on this\nbarren strand if thou dost leave him.\"\n\nAll this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she\ncould say in answer was, \"Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me\nbecome a Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allah\nknows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these\nChristians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to accompany\nthem, but remain at home, it would have been impossible for me, so\neagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose,\nwhich I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it seems\nwicked.\"\n\nBut neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this;\nand so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our voyage,\nin which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure\nof finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak.\nBut, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without being\nattended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it,\nour fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at his\ndaughter (for whatever kind of father they may come from these are always\nto be dreaded), brought it about that when we were now in mid-sea, and\nthe night about three hours spent, as we were running with all sail set\nand oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the trouble of using\nthem, we saw by the light of the moon, which shone brilliantly, a\nsquare-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffing up and standing\nacross our course, and so close that we had to strike sail to avoid\nrunning foul of her, while they too put the helm hard up to let us pass.\nThey came to the side of the ship to ask who we were, whither we were\nbound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in French our renegade\nsaid, \"Let no one answer, for no doubt these are French corsairs who\nplunder all comers.\"\n\nActing on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a\nlittle ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they\nfired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one\nthey cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the\nsea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our\nvessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any\nfurther damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for\nhelp and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning\nto fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a\ndozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning,\ngot into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our\nvessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come to\nus through our incivility in not giving them an answer. Our renegade took\nthe trunk containing Zoraida's wealth and dropped it into the sea without\nanyone perceiving what he did. In short we went on board with the\nFrenchmen, who, after having ascertained all they wanted to know about\nus, rifled us of everything we had, as if they had been our bitterest\nenemies, and from Zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her\nfeet; but the distress they caused her did not distress me so much as the\nfear I was in that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they\nwould proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more\nthan all. The desires, however, of those people do not go beyond money,\nbut of that their covetousness is insatiable, and on this occasion it was\ncarried to such a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we\nwore as captives if they had been worth anything to them. It was the\nadvice of some of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail;\nfor their purpose was to trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving\nthemselves out as Bretons, and if they brought us alive they would be\npunished as soon as the robbery was discovered; but the captain (who was\nthe one who had plundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with\nthe prize he had got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port,\nbut pass the Straits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make\nfor La Rochelle, from which he had sailed. So they agreed by common\nconsent to give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required\nfor the short voyage that remained to us, and this they did the next day\non coming in sight of the Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt,\nall our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they\nhad never been endured by us, such is the delight of recovering lost\nliberty.\n\nIt may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving us\ntwo kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know not\nwhat compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave her some\nforty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from her those\nsame garments which she has on now. We got into the boat, returning them\nthanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves grateful rather\nthan indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the straits; we,\nwithout looking to any compass save the land we had before us, set\nourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that we\nmight easily, we thought, land before the night was far advanced. But as\nthe moon did not show that night, and the sky was clouded, and as we knew\nnot whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make\nfor the shore, as several of us advised, saying we ought to run ourselves\nashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation, for in this\nway we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of the\nprowling vessels of the Tetuan corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall\nand are on the Spanish coast by daybreak, where they commonly take some\nprize, and then go home to sleep in their own houses. But of the\nconflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should\napproach gradually, and land where we could if the sea were calm enough\nto permit us. This was done, and a little before midnight we drew near to\nthe foot of a huge and lofty mountain, not so close to the sea but that\nit left a narrow space on which to land conveniently. We ran our boat up\non the sand, and all sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of\njoyful satisfaction returned thanks to God our Lord for all his\nincomparable goodness to us on our voyage. We took out of the boat the\nprovisions it contained, and drew it up on the shore, and then climbed a\nlong way up the mountain, for even there we could not feel easy in our\nhearts, or persuade ourselves that it was Christian soil that was now\nunder our feet.\n\nThe dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we\ncompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation or\nany shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we might,\nneither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we perceive.\nHowever, we determined to push on farther, as it could not but be that\nere long we must see some one who could tell us where we were. But what\ndistressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over that rough\nground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she was more\nwearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she would never\nagain allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very patiently and\ncheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone rather less than a\nquarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears, a\nclear proof that there were flocks hard by, and looking about carefully\nto see if any were within view, we observed a young shepherd tranquilly\nand unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork\ntree. We called to him, and he, raising his head, sprang nimbly to his\nfeet, for, as we afterwards learned, the first who presented themselves\nto his sight were the renegade and Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish\ndress he imagined that all the Moors of Barbary were upon him; and\nplunging with marvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him, he\nbegan to raise a prodigious outcry, exclaiming, \"The Moors--the Moors\nhave landed! To arms, to arms!\" We were all thrown into perplexity by\nthese cries, not knowing what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of\nthe shepherd would raise the country and that the mounted coast-guard\nwould come at once to see what was the matter, we agreed that the\nrenegade must strip off his Turkish garments and put on a captive's\njacket or coat which one of our party gave him at once, though he himself\nwas reduced to his shirt; and so commending ourselves to God, we followed\nthe same road which we saw the shepherd take, expecting every moment that\nthe coast-guard would be down upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive\nus, for two hours had not passed when, coming out of the brushwood into\nthe open ground, we perceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching\nus at a hand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for\nthem; but as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest\nof, saw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them\nasked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having raised\nthe call to arms. I said \"Yes,\" and as I was about to explain to him what\nhad occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the Christians\nof our party recognised the horseman who had put the question to us, and\nbefore I could say anything more he exclaimed:\n\n\"Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if I\ndo not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga\nunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to\nrecollect that you, senor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,\nmy uncle.\"\n\nThe Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman\nthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:\n\n\"Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I\nmourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin that\nare still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that they may\nenjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that thou wert in\nAlgiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those of all this\ncompany, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous restoration to\nliberty.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" replied the young man, \"and by-and-by we will tell you\nall.\"\n\nAs soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives, they\ndismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to the\ncity of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some of them\nwent to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where we had left\nit; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed on the horse of\nthe young man's uncle. The whole town came out to meet us, for they had\nby this time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance.\nThey were not astonished to see liberated captives or captive Moors, for\npeople on that coast are well used to see both one and the other; but\nthey were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida, which was just then\nheightened, as well by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding\nherself on Christian soil, and relieved of all fear of being lost; for\nthis had brought such a glow upon her face, that unless my affection for\nher were deceiving me, I would venture to say that there was not a more\nbeautiful creature in the world--at least, that I had ever seen. We went\nstraight to the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we had\nreceived, and when Zoraida entered it she said there were faces there\nlike Lela Marien's. We told her they were her images; and as well as he\ncould the renegade explained to her what they meant, that she might adore\nthem as if each of them were the very same Lela Marien that had spoken to\nher; and she, having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct,\nunderstood at once all he said to her about them. Thence they took us\naway and distributed us all in different houses in the town; but as for\nthe renegade, Zoraida, and myself, the Christian who came with us brought\nus to the house of his parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of\nfortune, and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son.\n\nWe remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having\ninformed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for the\ncity of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Church\nthrough the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released captives\ntook their departures, each the way that seemed best to him, and Zoraida\nand I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which the\ncourtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I\nbought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present attending her\nas her father and squire and not as her husband, we are now going to\nascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better\nfortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion\nof Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy,\nthat I would rather have. The patience with which she endures the\nhardships that poverty brings with it, and the eagerness she shows to\nbecome a Christian, are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind\nme to serve her all my life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself\nhers, and her mine, is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I\nshall find any corner to shelter her in my own country, or whether time\nand death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my\nfather and brothers, that I shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if\nthey are not alive.\n\nI have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an\ninteresting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I can\nsay is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fear\nof wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL OTHER\nTHINGS WORTH KNOWING\n\n\nWith these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to\nhim, \"In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this\nremarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and\nstrangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and\nabounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and\nastonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to\nit that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though\nto-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.\" And while\nhe said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to\nhim in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so\nkindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their\ngood-will. In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back with\nhim, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism of\nZoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making his\nappearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was entitled\nto. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously, although\nhe would not accept any of their generous offers.\n\nBy this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a\ncoach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to\nwhich the landlady replied that there was not a hand's breadth of the\nwhole inn unoccupied.\n\n\"Still, for all that,\" said one of those who had entered on horseback,\n\"room must be found for his lordship the Judge here.\"\n\nAt this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, \"Senor, the fact is\nI have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him, as no\ndoubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I will\ngive up our room to accommodate his worship.\"\n\n\"Very good, so be it,\" said the squire; but in the meantime a man had got\nout of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he\nheld, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he\nwas, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by the hand a young\ngirl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of\nsuch a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled\nwith admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seen\nDorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would\nhave fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden's would have been\nhard to find. Don Quixote was present at the entrance of the Judge with\nthe young lady, and as soon as he saw him he said, \"Your worship may with\nconfidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though the\naccommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped or\ninconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all\nif arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as letters\nrepresented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not only\nought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks\nshould rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves\ndown to give her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this\nparadise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven\nyour worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme\nexcellence, and beauty in its highest perfection.\"\n\nThe Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote, whom\nhe scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure than by\nhis talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a fresh\nsurprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and Zoraida,\nwho, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady,\nhad come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the\ncurate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style.\nIn short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of bewilderment, as well\nwith what he saw as what he heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave\nthe fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole he could perceive that\nall who were there were people of quality; but with the figure,\ncountenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his wits' end; and all\ncivilities having been exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn\ninquired into, it was settled, as it had been before settled, that all\nthe women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned,\nand that the men should remain outside as if to guard them; the Judge,\ntherefore, was very well pleased to allow his daughter, for such the\ndamsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did very willingly; and with\npart of the host's narrow bed and half of what the Judge had brought with\nhim, they made a more comfortable arrangement for the night than they had\nexpected.\n\nThe captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the\nJudge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the\nservants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew from\nwhat part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was called\nthe Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he\ncame from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and\nwhat he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who\nhad adopted letters by his father's advice; and excited and rejoiced, he\ncalled Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how\nthe matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother. The\nservant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies with\nthe appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had\nlearned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter, whose mother had\ndied in giving birth to her, and that he was very rich in consequence of\nthe dowry left to him with the daughter. He asked their advice as to what\nmeans he should adopt to make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand\nwhether, when he had made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor,\nwould be ashamed of him, or would receive him with a warm heart.\n\n\"Leave it to me to find out that,\" said the curate; \"though there is no\nreason for supposing, senor captain, that you will not be kindly\nreceived, because the worth and wisdom that your brother's bearing shows\nhim to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty or\ninsensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents of\nfortune at their proper value.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said the captain, \"I would not make myself known abruptly, but\nin some indirect way.\"\n\n\"I have told you already,\" said the curate, \"that I will manage it in a\nway to satisfy us all.\"\n\nBy this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the\ntable, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in\ntheir own room. In the middle of supper the curate said:\n\n\"I had a comrade of your worship's name, Senor Judge, in Constantinople,\nwhere I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one of\nthe stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but he\nhad as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage.\"\n\n\"And how was the captain called, senor?\" asked the Judge.\n\n\"He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,\" replied the curate, \"and he was born\nin a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a circumstance\nconnected with his father and his brothers which, had it not been told me\nby so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down as one of those\nfables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he said his father\nhad divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words of\nadvice to them sounder than any of Cato's. But I can say this much, that\nthe choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success,\nthat by his gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his\nown merit, he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see\nhimself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a\ncorps before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might have\nexpected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious\nday when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine\nat the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves\ncomrades at Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with\none of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the\nworld.\"\n\nHere the curate went on to relate briefly his brother's adventure with\nZoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he\nnever before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only went\nso far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in the\nboat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair Moor\nwere left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of\nthem, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by the\nFrenchmen.\n\nThe captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the\ncurate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon as\nhe perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep sigh\nand said with his eyes full of tears, \"Oh, senor, if you only knew what\nnews you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I\nfeel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my\nworldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak of\nis my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my\nother brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms,\nwhich was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your\ncomrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I\nfollowed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised\nme to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so\nwealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully\nrepaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my father's\nhands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity, while I too\nhave been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable\nfashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father is still alive,\nthough dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son, and he prays God\nunceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he has looked upon\nthose of his son; but with regard to him what surprises me is, that\nhaving so much common sense as he had, he should have neglected to give\nany intelligence about himself, either in his troubles and sufferings, or\nin his prosperity, for if his father or any of us had known of his\ncondition he need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain\nhis ransom; but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those\nFrenchmen may have restored him to liberty, or murdered him to hide the\nrobbery. All this will make me continue my journey, not with the\nsatisfaction in which I began it, but in the deepest melancholy and\nsadness. Oh dear brother! that I only knew where thou art now, and I\nwould hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thy sufferings,\nthough it were to cost me suffering myself! Oh that I could bring news to\nour old father that thou art alive, even wert thou the deepest dungeon of\nBarbary; for his wealth and my brother's and mine would rescue thee\nthence! Oh beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy good\ngoodness to a brother! That I could be present at the new birth of thy\nsoul, and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!\"\n\nAll this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he\nhad received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it, showing\ntheir sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how well he had\nsucceeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain's wishes, had no\ndesire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from the table and\ngoing into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the hand, Luscinda,\nDorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her. The captain was waiting\nto see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him with the\nother hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the other\ngentlemen were and said, \"Let your tears cease to flow, Senor Judge, and\nthe wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for you\nhave before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He whom\nyou see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has\nbeen so good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the\nstate of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind\nheart.\"\n\nThe captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his\nbreast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off but\nas soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so\nclosely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present\ncould not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion\nthey showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in\nwriting. They told each other in a few words the events of their lives;\nthey showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the\njudge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he\nmade his daughter embrace her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor\ndrew fresh tears from every eye. And there was Don Quixote observing all\nthese strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, and\nattributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed\nthat the captain and Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville,\nand send news to his father of his having been delivered and found, so as\nto enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of\nZoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as\nhe was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from\nSeville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great\ninconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at\nthe captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night\nwere past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don\nQuixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be\nattacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the\ngreat treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him\nreturned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an account\nof his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused.\nSancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to\nrest; and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he\nstretched himself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told\nfarther on, cost him so dear.\n\nThe ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having\ndisposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote\nsallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had\npromised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn\na voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it\nforced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had\nbeen awake, and by whose side Dona Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge's\ndaughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that\nsang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At\none moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at\nanother in the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering,\nCardenio came to the door and said, \"Listen, whoever is not asleep, and\nyou will hear a muleteer's voice that enchants as it chants.\"\n\n\"We are listening to it already, senor,\" said Dorothea; on which Cardenio\nwent away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out the\nwords of the song to be these:\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITH\nOTHER STRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INN\n\nAh me, Love's mariner am I\n  On Love's deep ocean sailing;\nI know not where the haven lies,\n  I dare not hope to gain it.\n\nOne solitary distant star\n  Is all I have to guide me,\nA brighter orb than those of old\n  That Palinurus lighted.\n\nAnd vaguely drifting am I borne,\n  I know not where it leads me;\nI fix my gaze on it alone,\n  Of all beside it heedless.\n\nBut over-cautious prudery,\n  And coyness cold and cruel,\nWhen most I need it, these, like clouds,\n  Its longed-for light refuse me.\n\nBright star, goal of my yearning eyes\n  As thou above me beamest,\nWhen thou shalt hide thee from my sight\n  I'll know that death is near me.\n\nThe singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to\nlet Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to\nside, she woke her, saying:\n\n\"Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have\nthe pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in\nall thy life.\"\n\nClara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what\nDorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and\nClara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as\nthe singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were\nsuffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms\nround Dorothea she said:\n\n\"Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest\nkindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as\nneither to see or hear that unhappy musician.\"\n\n\"What art thou talking about, child?\" said Dorothea. \"Why, they say this\nsinger is a muleteer!\"\n\n\"Nay, he is the lord of many places,\" replied Clara, \"and that one in my\nheart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he\nbe willing to surrender it.\"\n\nDorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to\nbe far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any\npromise of, so she said to her:\n\n\"You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Senora Clara;\nexplain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying\nabout hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?\nBut do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get\nfrom listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports,\nfor I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.\"\n\n\"Let him, in Heaven's name,\" returned Clara; and not to hear him she\nstopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised;\nbut turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this\nfashion:\n\n  Sweet Hope, my stay,\nThat onward to the goal of thy intent\n  Dost make thy way,\nHeedless of hindrance or impediment,\n  Have thou no fear\nIf at each step thou findest death is near.\n\n  No victory,\nNo joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;\n  Unblest is he\nThat a bold front to Fortune dares not show,\n  But soul and sense\nIn bondage yieldeth up to indolence.\n\n  If Love his wares\nDo dearly sell, his right must be contest;\n  What gold compares\nWith that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?\n  And all men know\nWhat costeth little that we rate but low.\n\n  Love resolute\nKnows not the word \"impossibility;\"\n  And though my suit\nBeset by endless obstacles I see,\n  Yet no despair\nShall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.\n\nHere the voice ceased and Clara's sobs began afresh, all which excited\nDorothea's curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet\nand weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going\nto say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her,\nwinding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear\nthat she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and\nsaid:\n\n\"This singer, dear senora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of\ntwo villages, who lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and though\nmy father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter, and\nlattice-work in summer, in some way--I know not how--this gentleman, who\nwas pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I\ncannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it\nfrom the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was\nforced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it was\nhe wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to link one hand\nin the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I should have\nbeen glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I knew not whom to\nopen my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing him no favour,\nexcept when my father, and his too, were from home, to raise the curtain\nor the lattice a little and let him see me plainly, at which he would\nshow such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad. Meanwhile the\ntime for my father's departure arrived, which he became aware of, but not\nfrom me, for I had never been able to tell him of it. He fell sick, of\ngrief I believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him to\ntake farewell of him, were it only with the eyes. But after we had been\ntwo days on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day's journey\nfrom this, I saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and so\nwell disguised, that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart it\nwould have been impossible for me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I\nwas surprised, and glad; he watched me, unsuspected by my father, from\nwhom he always hides himself when he crosses my path on the road, or in\nthe posadas where we halt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that\nfor love of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am\nready to die of sorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I\nknow not with what object he has come; or how he could have got away from\nhis father, who loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and\nbecause he deserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And\nmoreover, I can tell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I\nhave heard them say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more,\nevery time I see him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am\nterrified lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our\nloves. I have never spoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I\nlove him so that I could not live without him. This, dear senora, is all\nI have to tell you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so\nmuch; and from it alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but\na lord of hearts and towns, as I told you already.\"\n\n\"Say no more, Dona Clara,\" said Dorothea at this, at the same time\nkissing her a thousand times over, \"say no more, I tell you, but wait\ntill day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so\nthat it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves.\"\n\n\"Ah, senora,\" said Dona Clara, \"what end can be hoped for when his father\nis of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I was not\nfit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to marrying\nwithout the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all the world.\nI would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and\nleave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance we shall\nhave to travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier; though I daresay\nthe remedy I propose will do me very little good. I don't know how the\ndevil this has come about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such\na young girl, and he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of\nan age, and I am not sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day,\nnext, my father says.\"\n\nDorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Dona Clara\nspoke. \"Let us go to sleep now, senora,\" said she, \"for the little of the\nnight that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight, and we\nwill set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.\"\n\nWith this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn.\nThe only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her servant\nMaritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote's humour, and that\nhe was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback,\nresolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate\nto amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense. As it so\nhappened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards\nexcept a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to\nthrow out the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves,\nand observed Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time\nto time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to\npluck up his soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear\nhim, too, saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, \"Oh my lady Dulcinea del\nToboso, perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion,\ntreasure house of grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all\nthat is good, honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace\ndoing now? Art thou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his\nown free will hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve\nthee? Give me tidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at\nthis moment, envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces\nto and fro some gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some\nbalcony, meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she\nmay mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her\nsake, what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil,\nand lastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh\nsun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise\nbetimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of\nthee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see her\nand salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more jealous\nof thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat\nand run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the Peneus (for\nI do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion)\nin thy jealousy and love.\"\n\nDon Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady's\ndaughter began to signal to him, saying, \"Senor, come over here, please.\"\n\nAt these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the\nlight of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that some one\nwas calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be a\nwindow, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as\nhe believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested\nitself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair\ndamsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him,\nwas once more endeavouring to win his affections; and with this idea, not\nto show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante's head\nand approached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said:\n\n\"I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts\nof love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can\nbe made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which\nyou must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable\nof submission to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes\nbeheld her, he made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble\nlady, and retire to your apartment, and do not, by any further\ndeclaration of your passion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful;\nand if, of the love you bear me, you should find that there is anything\nelse in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided it be not love\nitself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that sweet absent enemy of\nmine to grant it this instant, though it be that you require of me a lock\nof Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or even the very beams of the sun\nshut up in a vial.\"\n\n\"My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,\" said Maritornes at\nthis.\n\n\"What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?\" replied Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"Only one of your fair hands,\" said Maritornes, \"to enable her to vent\nover it the great passion which has brought her to this loophole,\nso much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had heard\nher, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.\"\n\n\"I should like to see that tried,\" said Don Quixote; \"but he had better\nbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that\never father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of\na love-stricken daughter.\"\n\nMaritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had\nasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and\nwent into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza's ass,\nand in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted\nhimself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated\nwindow where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his\nhand, he said, \"Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the\nevil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of\nwoman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my\nentire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you\nmay observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the\nmuscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer what\nmust be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.\"\n\n\"That we shall see presently,\" said Maritornes, and making a running knot\non the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the hole\ntied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft.\n\nDon Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,\n\"Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it\nnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution has\ngiven you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;\nremember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so\ncruelly.\"\n\nBut there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for\nas soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to\ndie with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was\nimpossible for him to release himself.\n\nHe was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed\nthrough the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in\nmighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were\nto stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the least\nmovement, although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of\nRocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would stand without\nbudging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then, and that the\nladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was done by\nenchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle that\nenchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in his\nheart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the castle\nagain, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a settled\npoint with knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure, and\nhave not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not reserved for them\nbut for others, and that therefore they need not try it again.\nNevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself, but it\nhad been made so fast that all his efforts were in vain. It is true he\npulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but try as he might to seat\nhimself in the saddle, he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull\nhis hand off. Then it was he wished for the sword of Amadis, against\nwhich no enchantment whatever had any power; then he cursed his ill\nfortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his\nabsence while he remained there enchanted, for that he believed he was\nbeyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved\nDulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his worthy squire Sancho Panza,\nwho, buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass, was\noblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him; then he called\nupon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked\nhis good friend Urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning found\nhim in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing\nlike a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his\nsuffering, which he believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he was\nenchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never\nstirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were\nto remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until\nthe malign influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more\nsage enchanter should disenchant him.\n\nBut he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly\nbegun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well\nequipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. They\ncalled out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was still\nshut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he was, did not\nforget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and imperious tone,\n\"Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at the\ngates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within are\neither asleep, or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortress\nuntil the sun's rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth.\nWithdraw to a distance, and wait till it is broad daylight, and then we\nshall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you.\"\n\n\"What the devil fortress or castle is this,\" said one, \"to make us stand\non such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we are\ntravellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are in\nhaste.\"\n\n\"Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"I don't know what you look like,\" replied the other; \"but I know that\nyou are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.\"\n\n\"A castle it is,\" returned Don Quixote, \"nay, more, one of the best in\nthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had the sceptre\nin the hand and the crown on the head.\"\n\n\"It would be better if it were the other way,\" said the traveller, \"the\nsceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, may be there is\nwithin some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to have\nthose crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this,\nand where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people entitled to\ncrowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\"\n\n\"You know but little of the world,\" returned Don Quixote, \"since you are\nignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.\"\n\nBut the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with Don\nQuixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that the\nhost, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got up to\nask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the horses of the\nfour who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy,\ndejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, supporting his sorely\nstretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if\nhe were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smelling\nthe one who had come to offer him attentions. But he had hardly moved at\nall when Don Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, he\nwould have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which\ncaused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cut\nthrough or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he could\njust touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for,\nfinding how little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he\nstruggled and stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing;\njust like those undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are\nfixed at \"touch and no touch,\" who aggravate their own sufferings by\ntheir violent efforts to stretch themselves, deceived by the hope which\nmakes them fancy that with a very little more they will reach the ground.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nIN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN\n\n\nSo loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord\nopening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to\nsee who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.\nMaritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,\nsuspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her,\nuntied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he came to\nthe ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who\napproaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so. He\nwithout replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his\nfeet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance\nin rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a\nhalf-gallop exclaiming:\n\n\"Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided\nmy lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him\nthe lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.\"\n\nThe newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but\nthe landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not\nto mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord if\nby any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn,\none dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance,\ndescribing that of Dona Clara's lover. The landlord replied that there\nwere so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were\ninquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had\ncome, said, \"He is here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following:\nlet one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or\nindeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he\nshould escape over the wall of the yard.\" \"So be it,\" said another; and\nwhile two of them went in, one remained at the gate and the other made\nthe circuit of the inn; observing all which, the landlord was unable to\nconjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions, though\nhe understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had\ngiven him.\n\nIt was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in\nconsequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and\nup, but particularly Dona Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to\nsleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so\nnear her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw\nthat not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to\nhis challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath;\nand if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was\nlawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise,\nwhen he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any\nuntil he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would\nhave attacked the whole of them, and would have made them return an\nanswer in spite of themselves. But considering that it would not become\nhim, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until he had established\nMicomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to hold his peace and wait\nquietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same\ntravellers; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by\nthe side of a muleteer, without a thought of anyone coming in search of\nhim, much less finding him.\n\nThe man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, \"It becomes you well indeed,\nSenor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I\nfind you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.\"\n\nThe youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held\nhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father's servants, at\nwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter\na word; while the servant went on to say, \"There is nothing for it now,\nSenor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is your\nwish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the other\nworld, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at\nyour absence.\"\n\n\"But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?\"\nsaid Don Luis.\n\n\"It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,\" answered the\nservant, \"that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw\nyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his\nservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better\npleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to\nrestore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.\"\n\n\"That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,\" returned Don Luis.\n\n\"What can you please or heaven order,\" said the other, \"except to agree\nto go back? Anything else is impossible.\"\n\nAll this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at\nwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken\nplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time\ndressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as\n\"Don,\" and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to his\nfather, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what they\nalready knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him, they\nall felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and even to\nhelp him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so they\nhastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant.\nDorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed by Dona Clara all\nin a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him in a few words the\nstory of the musician and Dona Clara, and he at the same time told her\nwhat had happened, how his father's servants had come in search of him;\nbut in telling her so, he did not speak low enough but that Dona Clara\nheard what he said, at which she was so much agitated that had not\nDorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground.\nCardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to\nmake the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who\nhad come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded\nhim, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a\nmoment's delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until\nhe had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were\nat stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would\nnot return without him, and that they would take him away whether he\nliked it or not.\n\n\"You shall not do that,\" replied Don Luis, \"unless you take me dead;\nthough however you take me, it will be without life.\"\n\nBy this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute,\nbut particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the\ncurate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no\nnecessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio being\nalready acquainted with the young man's story, asked the men who wanted\nto take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth\nagainst his will.\n\n\"Our object,\" said one of the four, \"is to save the life of his father,\nwho is in danger of losing it through this gentleman's disappearance.\"\n\nUpon this Don Luis exclaimed, \"There is no need to make my affairs public\nhere; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you\nshall compel me.\"\n\n\"Reason will compel your worship,\" said the man, \"and if it has no power\nover you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what\nit is our duty to do.\"\n\n\"Let us hear what the whole affair is about,\" said the Judge at this; but\nthe man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, \"Do you not know\nthis gentleman, Senor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour, who has run\naway from his father's house in a dress so unbecoming his rank, as your\nworship may perceive.\"\n\nThe judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and\nembracing him said, \"What folly is this, Senor Don Luis, or what can have\nbeen the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way, and\nin this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?\"\n\nTears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a\nword in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be uneasy,\nfor all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don Luis by the\nhand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there.\n\nBut while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of\nthe inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the\nnight there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four\nmen wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they\nowed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs more than other\npeople's, caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning,\nabusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them\nto reply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a\nstyle that the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help. The\nlandlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don\nQuixote, and to him the daughter said, \"Sir knight, by the virtue God has\ngiven you, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him to a\nmummy.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, \"Fair\ndamsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I am\ndebarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to a\nhappy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I\ncan do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your father to\nstand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no account to\nallow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of the\nPrincess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if\nshe grants it, rest assured I will relieve him from it.\"\n\n\"Sinner that I am,\" exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; \"before you have\ngot your permission my master will be in the other world.\"\n\n\"Give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission I speak of,\" returned\nDon Quixote; \"and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in the\nother world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world\ncan do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who\nshall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately\nsatisfied;\" and without saying anything more he went and knelt before\nDorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be\npleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that\ncastle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it\ngraciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing\nhis sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were still\nhandling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot he\nstopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady asked\nhim why he hesitated to help their master and husband.\n\n\"I hesitate,\" said Don Quixote, \"because it is not lawful for me to draw\nsword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho to\nme; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.\"\n\nThus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively\nexchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord\nand to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were\nfurious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard\ntreatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let us\nleave him there; for he will surely find some one to help him, and if\nnot, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his\nstrength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what Don\nLuis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him privately as\nto his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.\n\nTo which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was\ntroubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made\nanswer:\n\n\"Senor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,\nthrough heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Dona\nClara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the\nmistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no\nimpediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my\nfather's house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her\nwhithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the\npole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have\nlearned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were\nfilled with tears. You know already, senor, the wealth and noble birth of\nmy parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient\ninducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at\nonce as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his\nown, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time\nhas more power to alter and change things, than human will.\"\n\nWith this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after\nhearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the\nmanner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of\nhis heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing what\ncourse to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the answer,\ntherefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for the\npresent, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day, so\nthat there might be time to consider what was best for all parties. Don\nLuis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his tears, in a way\nthat would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the Judge,\nwho, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriage\nwould be to his daughter; though, were it possible, he would have\npreferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father\nof Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son.\n\nThe guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by\npersuasion and Don Quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had\npaid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for\nthe end of the conversation with the Judge and their master's decision,\nwhen the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom\nDon Quixote had taken Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings\nof his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter\nthe inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed\nSancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the\npack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack\nSancho, exclaiming, \"Ho, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basin\nand my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.\"\n\nSancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse\npoured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the other\ngave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The barber,\nhowever, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the\npack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in\nthe inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. \"Here, in\nthe name of the king and justice!\" he cried, \"this thief and highwayman\nwants to kill me for trying to recover my property.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" said Sancho, \"I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master\nDon Quixote won these spoils.\"\n\nDon Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his\nsquire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time\nforth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub\nhim a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure\nthat the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.\n\nIn the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,\n\"Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and\nI know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in\nthe stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit\nhim like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I was\nrobbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet\nhandselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\"\n\nAt this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and\ninterposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the\npack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\nestablished, and said, \"Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly\nthe error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which\nwas, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in fair\nwar, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession. With\nthe pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may tell you on that head\nthat my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of\nthis vanquished poltroon's steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed\nhim, and he took it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison\ninto a pack-saddle, I can give no explanation except the usual one, that\nsuch transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry. To\nconfirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which\nthis good fellow calls a basin.\"\n\n\"Egad, master,\" said Sancho, \"if we have no other proof of our case than\nwhat your worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much a basin\nas this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle.\"\n\n\"Do as I bid thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"it cannot be that everything in\nthis castle goes by enchantment.\"\n\nSancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and\nwhen Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:\n\n\"Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this\nis a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of\nchivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from\nhim, without anything added to or taken from it.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said Sancho, \"for from the time my master\nwon it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose\nthose unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this basin-helmet he\nwould not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of\nstone-throwing in that affair.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nIN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO'S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE\nIS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND\nEARNEST\n\n\n\"What do you think now, gentlemen,\" said the barber, \"of what these\ngentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\"\n\n\"And whoever says the contrary,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will let him know\nhe lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a\nthousand times.\"\n\nOur own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote's\nhumour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and\ncarry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other\nbarber he said:\n\n\"Senor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your\nprofession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty\nyears, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them,\nperfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of\nmy youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece\nwith a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say\nto soldiers' arms; and I say-saving better opinions and always with\nsubmission to sounder judgments--that this piece we have now before us,\nwhich this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber's\nbasin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth\nfrom falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is\nnot a complete helmet.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for half of it is wanting, that is to\nsay the beaver.\"\n\n\"It is quite true,\" said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the\nbarber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him,\nand even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis's\naffair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up\nwith the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no\nattention to these facetious proceedings.\n\n\"God bless me!\" exclaimed their butt the barber at this; \"is it possible\nthat such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but a\nhelmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university,\nhowever wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a helmet, why,\nthen the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has\nsaid.\"\n\n\"To me it looks like a pack-saddle,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I have\nalready said that with that question I do not concern myself.\"\n\n\"As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,\" said the curate, \"it is\nonly for Senor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all\nthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\"\n\n\"By God, gentlemen,\" said Don Quixote, \"so many strange things have\nhappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have\nsojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively in\nreply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my belief\nthat everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The first\ntime, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor did\nSancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night I was\nkept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing how or why\nI came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward to give an\nopinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision. As\nregards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have\nalready given an answer; but as to the question whether this is a\npack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion,\nbut will leave it to your worships' better judgment. Perhaps as you are\nnot dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of this place have\nnothing to do with you, and your faculties are unfettered, and you can\nsee things in this castle as they really and truly are, and not as they\nappear to me.\"\n\n\"There can be no question,\" said Don Fernando on this, \"but that Senor\nDon Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision\nof this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take\nthe votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly and\nfully.\"\n\nTo those who were in the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this afforded\ngreat amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed the\ngreatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of Don\nLuis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three other travellers who\nhad by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of the\nHoly Brotherhood, as indeed they were; but the one who above all was at\nhis wits' end, was the barber whose basin, there before his very eyes, had been\nturned into Mambrino's helmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt\nwhatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to\nsee Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes, and\nwhispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasure\nover which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a\ncaparison; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don\nQuixote, he said aloud, \"The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired\ncollecting such a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of\nwhom I ask what I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd\nto say that this is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a\nhorse, nay, of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of\nyou and your ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have\nstated and proved your case very badly.\"\n\n\"May I never share heaven,\" said the poor barber, \"if your worships are\nnot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to me\na pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, 'laws go,'-I say no more; and\nindeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.\"\n\nThe simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the\nabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:\n\n\"There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to\nhim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\"\n\nBut said one of the four servants, \"Unless, indeed, this is a deliberate\njoke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as those\npresent are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this\nis not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they\ndo assert and declare it, I can only come to the conclusion that there is\nsome mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence of\nexperience and truth itself; for I swear by\"--and here he rapped out a\nround oath-\"all the people in the world will not make me believe that\nthis is not a barber's basin and that a jackass's pack-saddle.\"\n\n\"It might easily be a she-ass's,\" observed the curate.\n\n\"It is all the same,\" said the servant; \"that is not the point; but\nwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.\"\n\nOn hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, who\nhad been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain his\nanger and impatience, exclaimed, \"It is a pack-saddle as sure as my\nfather is my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must\nbe drunk.\"\n\n\"You lie like a rascally clown,\" returned Don Quixote; and lifting his\npike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow at\nhis head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched him\nat full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, and\nthe rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout,\ncalling for help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was of the\nfraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, and\nranged himself on the side of his comrades; the servants of Don Luis\nclustered round him, lest he should escape from them in the confusion;\nthe barber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of\nhis pack-saddle and Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his sword and\ncharged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his servants to leave him\nalone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who\nwere supporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the\nlandlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping,\nDorothea was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Dona Clara in a faint.\nThe barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis\ngave one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep\nhim from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took\nhis part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was\nbelabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for\nhelp for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but\ncries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts,\nfisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all\nthis chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it\ninto his head that he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of\nAgramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he\ncried out:\n\n\"Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to me\nas they value their lives!\"\n\nAll paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \"Did I not tell\nyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of\ndevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with your\nown eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and been\ntransferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for the\nsword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the\nhelmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then, you,\nSenor Judge, and you, senor curate; let the one represent King Agramante\nand the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by God Almighty\nit is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as we are should\nslay one another for such trifling cause.\" The officers, who did not\nunderstand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly\nhandled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be\nappeased; the barber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle\nwere the worse for the struggle; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the\nslightest word of his master; while the four servants of Don Luis kept\nquiet when they saw how little they gained by not being so. The landlord\nalone insisted upon it that they must punish the insolence of this\nmadman, who at every turn raised a disturbance in the inn; but at length\nthe uproar was stilled for the present; the pack-saddle remained a\ncaparison till the day of judgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a\ncastle in Don Quixote's imagination.\n\nAll having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the\nJudge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him to\nreturn with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter with\nthem, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate\nas to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and\nwhat Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that Don Fernando\nshould tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that it was his\ndesire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia, where he would\nreceive from the marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him\nto; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis\nthat he would not return to his father at present, though they tore him\nto pieces. On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don\nLuis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them\nshould return to tell his father how matters stood, and that the other\nshould remain to wait upon Don Luis, and not leave him until they came\nback for him, or his father's orders were known. Thus by the authority of\nAgramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of\ndisputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace,\nfeeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had\ngained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement,\nresolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and\ndisturbances.\n\nIt came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the\nrank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the\ncontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely\nto get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been\nthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants\nhe carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don\nQuixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting\nthe galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason,\napprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as\nto whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and taking a parchment\nout of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting\nhimself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he\nmade out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on\ncomparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered\nthat beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As soon as he\nhad satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in\nhis left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so\ntightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted aloud, \"Help\nfor the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest,\nread this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.\"\n\nThe curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true,\nand that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his part, when\nhe found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the\nhighest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both\nhands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he\nnot been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don\nQuixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his\nbrother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her\nhusband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its\nnote was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling\nupon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going\non, exclaimed, \"By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about\nthe enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in\npeace in it!\"\n\nDon Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual\ncontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat\ncollar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the\nofficers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help,\nand deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for the\nservice of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf they\nagain demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber\nand footpad of the highways.\n\nDon Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, \"Come\nnow, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to\nthose in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the miserable, to\nraise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your\nvile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to\nyou the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin and\nignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to\nsay the presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers,\nbut of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell\nme who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a\nknight as I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are\nindependent of all jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their\ncharter their prowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say again, was\nthe fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that\nconfer such privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day\nhe is dubbed a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of\nchivalry? What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen's pin-money,\nking's dues, toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for\nmaking his clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever\nmade him pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What\ndamsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to\nhis will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is\nthere, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give,\nsingle-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the\nHoly Brotherhood if they come in his way?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nOF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY\nBROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE\n\n\nWhile Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring\nto persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might\nperceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the\nmatter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off,\nthey would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder\nof the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don\nQuixote's madness, but only to execute his superior's orders, and that\nonce taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked.\n\n\"For all that,\" said the curate, \"you must not take him away this time,\nnor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.\"\n\nIn short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad\nthings, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they\nhad not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow\nthemselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the\nbarber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with much\nbitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the question\nby arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectly\ncontented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed the\npack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino's\nhelmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's knowing it,\npaid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt\nand engagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for\nevermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most important and\ngravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to\nconsent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany\nhim whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better\nfortune, having already begun to solve difficulties and remove\nobstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn, were\npleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue; for the\nservants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which gave Dona Clara such\nhappiness that no one could have looked into her face just then without\nseeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she did not fully comprehend\nall she saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she watched and\nstudied the various countenances, but particularly her Spaniard's, whom\nshe followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. The gift and\ncompensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the\nlandlord's notice, and he demanded Don Quixote's reckoning, together with\nthe amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine,\nswearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn\nuntil he had been paid to the very last farthing. The curate settled all\namicably, and Don Fernando paid; though the Judge had also very readily\noffered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the\ninn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don\nQuixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of\nOctavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks\nwere due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to the\nunexampled generosity of Don Fernando.\n\nFinding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as well\nas his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continue\nthe journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure for\nwhich he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he went\nand knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter a\nword until he had risen; so to obey her he rose, and said, \"It is a\ncommon proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the mother of good\nfortune,' and experience has often shown in important affairs that the\nearnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful\ntermination; but in nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than\nin war, where quickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy,\nand win the victory before the foe has time to defend himself. All this I\nsay, exalted and esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to\nremain any longer in this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to\nus in a way that we shall find out some day; for who knows but that your\nenemy the giant may have learned by means of secret and diligent spies\nthat I am going to destroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he\nmay seize it to fortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold,\nagainst which all my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may\navail but little? Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his\nschemes by our activity, and let us depart at once in quest of fair\nfortune; for your highness is only kept from enjoying it as fully as you\ncould desire by my delay in encountering your adversary.\"\n\nDon Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply of\nthe beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style\nadapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these words, \"I give you\nthanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom it\nis a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy, display to\nafford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your wishes and\nmine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in this\nworld capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be forthwith, for\nI have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance with your\ngood pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her\nperson, and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must not\nthink of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain.\"\n\n\"On, then, in God's name,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, when a lady humbles\nherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and\nplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for\nthe common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my\neagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell\nseen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and\nget ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the\ncastellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.\"\n\nSancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, \"Ah!\nmaster, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of,\nbegging all good bodies' pardon.\"\n\n\"What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the\nworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"If your worship is angry,\" replied Sancho, \"I will hold my tongue and\nleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good\nservant should tell his master.\"\n\n\"Say what thou wilt,\" returned Don Quixote, \"provided thy words be not\nmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving like\nthyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\"\n\n\"It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,\" said Sancho,\n\"but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls\nherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my\nmother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses\nwith one that is here every instant and behind every door.\"\n\nDorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her husband\nDon Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, gathered\nfrom her lips some of the reward his love had earned, and Sancho seeing\nthis had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a\nqueen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to\nanswer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued, \"This I say, senor,\nbecause, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad\nnights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to\nreap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry\nto saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey;\nfor it will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her\nspinning, and let us go to dinner.\"\n\nGood God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the\naudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice\ninarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed\nliving fire, he exclaimed, \"Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and\nignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!\nHast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these\nillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless\nthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born\nmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,\ninventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect due\nto royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under pain of\nmy wrath;\" and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his cheeks,\ngazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his right\nfoot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart; and at\nhis words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and terrified that he\nwould have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowed\nhim, and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the\nangry presence of his master.\n\nBut the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don\nQuixote's humour, said, to mollify his wrath, \"Be not irritated at the\nabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from\nhis good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would\nbear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without any\nhesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle\ngoes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, may\npossibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he says he saw\nso much to the detriment of my modesty.\"\n\n\"I swear by God Omnipotent,\" exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \"your\nhighness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come\nbefore this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have been\nimpossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know well\nenough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he is\nincapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\"\n\n\"True, no doubt,\" said Don Fernando, \"for which reason, Senor Don\nQuixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your\nfavour, sicut erat in principio, before illusions of this sort had taken\naway his senses.\"\n\nDon Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for\nSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for the\nhand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him to\nkiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \"Now, Sancho my son, thou wilt\nbe convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, that\neverything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\"\n\n\"So it is, I believe,\" said Sancho, \"except the affair of the blanket,\nwhich came to pass in reality by ordinary means.\"\n\n\"Believe it not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for had it been so, I would have\navenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I,\nnor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\"\n\nThey were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the\nlandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which they\nlaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out of\ncountenance had not his master once more assured him it was all\nenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch\nthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,\nwithout any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by\nbeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,\nas his master believed and protested.\n\nThe illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it\nseemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without\ngiving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don\nQuixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the\ncurate and the barber might carry him away with them as they proposed,\nand the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home; and in\npursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who\nhappened to be passing that way to carry him after this fashion. They\nconstructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough to hold Don\nQuixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his companions, the\nservants of Don Luis, and the officers of the Brotherhood, together with\nthe landlord, by the directions and advice of the curate, covered their\nfaces and disguised themselves, some in one way, some in another, so as\nto appear to Don Quixote quite different from the persons he had seen in\nthe castle. This done, in profound silence they entered the room where he\nwas asleep, taking his rest after the past frays, and advancing to\nwhere he was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind\nhappening, they seized him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so\nthat, when he awoke startled, he was unable to move, and could only\nmarvel and wonder at the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he\nat once gave way to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured\nup before him, and took it into his head that all these shapes were\nphantoms of the enchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably\nenchanted as he could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the\ncurate, the concoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that\nwere there Sancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in\nhis own proper character, and he, though he was within very little of\nsharing his master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these\ndisguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he saw\nwhat came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the latter\nutter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was that\nbringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars so\nfirmly that they could not be easily burst open.\n\nThey then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the room\nan awful voice--as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle but\nthe other, was able to make it--was heard to say, \"O Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed afflict\nthee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy accomplishment of the\nadventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the which shall be\naccomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove\nshall be linked together, having first humbled their haughty necks to the\ngentle yoke of matrimony. And from this marvellous union shall come forth\nto the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the ravening\nclaws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass ere the\npursuer of the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice\nvisited the starry signs. And thou, O most noble and obedient squire that\never bore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell with, be not\ndismayed or grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried away\nthus before thy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the\nuniverse, thou shalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt\nnot know thyself, and the promises which thy good master has made thee\nshall not prove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage\nMentironiana, that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due\nseason. Follow then the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it\nis expedient that thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of\nyou; and as it is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for\nI return to that place I wot of;\" and as he brought the prophecy to a\nclose he raised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a\nsoft tone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost\ninclined to take what they heard seriously.\n\nDon Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once\ncomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to him\nthat he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his\nbeloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the\nwhelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughly\nand firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and with a deep\nsigh exclaimed, \"Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much\ngood, I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter\nwho takes charge of my interests, that he leave me not to perish in this\ncaptivity in which they are now carrying me away, ere I see fulfilled\npromises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me;\nfor, let this but come to pass, and I shall glory in the pains of my\nprison, find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me, and regard\nthis bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard battle-field, but as a\nsoft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the consolation of Sancho\nPanza, my squire, I rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will not\ndesert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it\nmay not happen to be in my power to give him the island I have promised,\nor any equivalent for it, at least his wages shall not be lost; for in my\nwill, which is already made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid\nto him, measured, not by his many faithful services, but by the means at\nmy disposal.\"\n\nSancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,\nbeing tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions\nlifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nOF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIED AWAY\nENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS\n\n\nWhen Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way,\nhe said, \"Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never\nyet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted\nknights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy,\nsluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through the air\nwith marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a\nchariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the\nkind; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart! By God, it puzzles me!\nBut perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a different\ncourse from that of those in days gone by; and it may be, too, that as I\nam a new knight in the world, and the first to revive the already\nforgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have newly invented\nother kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying off the\nenchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" answered Sancho, \"not being as well read as\nyour worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to say and\nswear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite catholic.\"\n\n\"Catholic!\" said Don Quixote. \"Father of me! how can they be Catholic\nwhen they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and do\nthis, and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it, touch\nthem, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and\nno consistency except in appearance.\"\n\n\"By God, master,\" returned Sancho, \"I have touched them already; and that\ndevil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and another\nproperty very different from what I have heard say devils have, for by\nall accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this\none smells of amber half a league off.\" Sancho was here speaking of Don\nFernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely perfumed as\nSancho said.\n\n\"Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"for let me\ntell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with\nthem, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if\nthey have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of\nsomething foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with\nthem wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their torments,\nand as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is\nimpossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest\nof seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or\nhe wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil.\"\n\nSuch was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don\nFernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho's making a complete\ndiscovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,\nresolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, they\ndirected him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho's ass,\nwhich he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the curate had made an\narrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far\nas his village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the buckler\non one side of the bow of Rocinante's saddle and the basin on the other,\nand by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante's\nbridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their\nmuskets; but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and\nher daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to\nweep with grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said:\n\n\"Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who\nfollow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me\nI should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things never\nhappen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world\nthinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied for\ntheir virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the\ndestruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless, virtue is of\nherself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster its\nfirst inventor knew, she will come victorious out of every trial, and\nshed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens. Forgive\nme, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in aught offended you;\nfor intentionally and wittingly I have never done so to any; and pray to\nGod that he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent\nenchanter has consigned me; and should I find myself released therefrom,\nthe favours that ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in\nmemory by me, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they\ndeserve.\"\n\nWhile this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote,\nthe curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and his\ncompanions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all made\nhappy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all embraced one\nanother, and promised to let each other know how things went with them,\nand Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him\nwhat became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that\ncould give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his\npart, would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know,\nabout his marriage, Zoraida's baptism, Don Luis's affair, and Luscinda's\nreturn to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request\ncarefully, and they embraced once more, and renewed their promises.\n\nThe landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying he\nhad discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of\n\"The Ill-advised Curiosity\" had been found, and that he might take them\nall away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could\nnot read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and\nopening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, \"Novel\nof Rinconete and Cortadillo,\" by which he perceived that it was a novel,\nand as that of \"The Ill-advised Curiosity\" had been good he concluded\nthis would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so\nhe kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then\nmounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to\nbe recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the\ncart. The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner\nleading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood,\nas has been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his\nass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and\nthe barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a\ngrave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the\noxen. Don Quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his\nfeet stretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as\nif he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and\nsilently they made, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley\nwhich the carter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his\noxen, and he said so to the curate, but the barber was of opinion that\nthey ought to push on a little farther, as at the other side of a hill\nwhich appeared close by he knew there was a valley that had more grass\nand much better than the one where they proposed to halt; and his advice\nwas taken and they continued their journey.\n\nJust at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them\nsix or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook\nthem, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of\noxen, but like men who rode canons' mules, and in haste to take their\nnoontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a\nleague off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous\nsalutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact,\na canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him, observing\nthe regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers, Sancho,\nRocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote caged and\nconfined, could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man\nin that fashion; though, from the badges of the officers, he already\nconcluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor\nwhose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood.\nOne of the officers to whom he had put the question, replied, \"Let the\ngentleman himself tell you the meaning of his going this way, senor, for\nwe do not know.\"\n\nDon Quixote overheard the conversation and said, \"Haply, gentlemen, you\nare versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you are\nI will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my giving\nmyself the trouble of relating them;\" but here the curate and the barber,\nseeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote,\ncame forward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem\nfrom being discovered.\n\nThe canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, \"In truth, brother, I know more\nabout books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando's elements of logic;\nso if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.\"\n\n\"In God's name, then, senor,\" replied Don Quixote; \"if that be so, I\nwould have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and\nfraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked\nthan loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose\nnames Fame has never thought of immortalising in her record, but of those\nwho, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians that\nPersia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia ever\nproduced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve\nas examples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see\nthe footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit\nand crowning point of honour in arms.\"\n\n\"What Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,\" observed the curate, \"is the\ntruth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or sins of\nhis, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious and\nvalour hateful. This, senor, is the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, if\nyou have ever heard him named, whose valiant achievements and mighty\ndeeds shall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble,\nnotwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to\nhide them.\"\n\nWhen the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty\ntalk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment,\nand could not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants were\nin the same state of amazement.\n\nAt this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation,\nsaid, in order to make everything plain, \"Well, sirs, you may like or\ndislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master,\nDon Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He is in his full\nsenses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like other men and as\nhe had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that's the case, what do\nthey mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? For I have heard\nmany a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk;\nand my master, if you don't stop him, will talk more than thirty\nlawyers.\" Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, \"Ah, senor curate,\nsenor curate! do you think I don't know you? Do you think I don't guess\nand see the drift of these new enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I\nknow you, for all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to\nyou, however you may hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns\nvirtue cannot live, and where there is niggardliness there can be no\nliberality. Ill betide the devil! if it had not been for your worship my\nmaster would be married to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I\nshould be a count at least; for no less was to be expected, as well from\nthe goodness of my master, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the\ngreatness of my services. But I see now how true it is what they say in\nthese parts, that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel,\nand that those who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my\nwife and children, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to\nsee their father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or\nkingdom, they will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this,\nsenor curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your\nill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you to\naccount in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way, and\ncharge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don\nQuixote leaves undone while he is shut up.\n\n\"Trim those lamps there!\" exclaimed the barber at this; \"so you are of\nthe same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see\nthat you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted like\nhim for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an evil\nhour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and that\nisland you long so much for found its way into your head.\"\n\n\"I am not with child by anyone,\" returned Sancho, \"nor am I a man to let\nmyself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I am poor\nI am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I long for an\nisland, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his own\nworks; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of an\nisland, especially as my master may win so many that he will not know\nwhom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is\nnot everything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I\nsay this because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw\nfalse dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the\ntruth; leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.\"\n\nThe barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he\nshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to\nconceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon\nto ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of\nthis man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The canon\nagreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to\nthe account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote,\ngiven him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and\norigin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to\nhis being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking\nhim home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his\nmadness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard\nDon Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished he said, \"To tell\nthe truth, senor curate, I for my part consider what they call books of\nchivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and\nfalse taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been\nprinted, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to\nend; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one\nhas nothing more in it than another; this no more than that. And in my\nopinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as\nthe fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at\ngiving amusement and not instruction, exactly the opposite of the\napologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time. And though it\nmay be the chief object of such books to amuse, I do not know how they\ncan succeed, when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense. For the\nenjoyment the mind feels must come from the beauty and harmony which it\nperceives or contemplates in the things that the eye or the imagination\nbrings before it; and nothing that has any ugliness or disproportion\nabout it can give any pleasure. What beauty, then, or what proportion of\nthe parts to the whole, or of the whole to the parts, can there be in a\nbook or fable where a lad of sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower\nand makes two halves of him as if he was an almond cake? And when they\nwant to give us a picture of a battle, after having told us that there\nare a million of combatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the\nbook be opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like\nit or not, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of\nhis strong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a\nborn queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some\nunknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and\nuncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of\nknights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and will\nbe to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of Prester John\nof the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described nor Marco Polo\nsaw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the authors of books of\nthe kind write them as fiction, and therefore are not bound to regard\nniceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is all the better the more\nit looks like truth, and gives the more pleasure the more probability and\npossibility there is about it. Plots in fiction should be wedded to the\nunderstanding of the reader, and be constructed in such a way that,\nreconciling impossibilities, smoothing over difficulties, keeping the\nmind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, divert, and entertain, so\nthat wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with the other; all\nwhich he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truth to\nnature, wherein lies the perfection of writing. I have never yet seen any\nbook of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in all its\nnumbers, so that the middle agrees with the beginning, and the end with\nthe beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such\na multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to produce a\nchimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides\nall this they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,\nlicentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix in\ntheir battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, in\nshort, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which reason they\ndeserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthless\nbreed.\"\n\nThe curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of\nsound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so\nhe told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge\nto books of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote's, which were many;\nand gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them, and of those\nhe had condemned to the flames and those he had spared, with which the\ncanon was not a little amused, adding that though he had said so much in\ncondemnation of these books, still he found one good thing in them, and\nthat was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect for\ndisplaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over\nwhich the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, tempests,\ncombats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the\nqualifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing\nthe wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his\nsoldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his time\nas in pressing the attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now\nsome joyful and unexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise,\nand modest; there a Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless,\nbarbarous braggart; there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious;\nsetting forth the devotion and loyalty of vassals, the greatness and\ngenerosity of nobles. \"Or again,\" said he, \"the author may show himself\nto be an astronomer, or a skilled cosmographer, or musician, or one\nversed in affairs of state, and sometimes he will have a chance of coming\nforward as a magician if he likes. He can set forth the craftiness of\nUlysses, the piety of AEneas, the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of\nHector, the treachery of Sinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the\ngenerosity of Alexander, the boldness of Caesar, the clemency and truth\nof Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all\nthe faculties that serve to make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting\nthem in one individual, again distributing them among many; and if this\nbe done with charm of style and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth\nas much as possible, he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied\nthreads that, when finished, will display such perfection and beauty that\nit will attain the worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I\nsaid before, is to give instruction and pleasure combined; for the\nunrestricted range of these books enables the author to show his powers,\nepic, lyric, tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning\narts of poesy and oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in\nprose just as well as in verse.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nIN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH\nOTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT\n\n\n\"It is as you say, senor canon,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason\nthose who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more\ncensure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the\nrules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous\nin prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.\"\n\n\"I myself, at any rate,\" said the canon, \"was once tempted to write a\nbook of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be\nobserved; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets\nwritten; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them\nto persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and\nintelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but\nthe pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering\napproval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as well because it\nseemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I\nperceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it\nis better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish\nmany, I have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly\npublic, to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part.\n\n\"But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of\nfinishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that\nare acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in\nvogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history,\nare, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that have neither\nhead nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with delight, and\nregards and cries them up as perfection when they are so far from it; and\nif the authors who write them, and the players who act them, say that\nthis is what they must be, for the public wants this and will have\nnothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a plot\naccording to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen intelligent\npeople to understand them, while all the rest remain blind to the merit\nof their composition; and that for themselves it is better to get bread\nfrom the many than praise from the few; then my book will fare the same\nway, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the\nprinciples I have spoken of, and I shall be 'the tailor of the corner.'\nAnd though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors that they are\nmistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they would attract\nmore people, and get more credit, by producing plays in accordance with\nthe rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to\ntheir own opinion that no argument or evidence can wean them from it.\n\n\"I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me,\ndo you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies\nacted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were\nsuch that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and\ninterest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the\nhigher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three\nalone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?'\n\n\"'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the \"Isabella,\" the\n\"Phyllis,\" and the \"Alexandra.\"'\n\n\"'Those are the ones I mean,' said I; 'and see if they did not observe\nthe principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show\ntheir superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not\nlie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who don't\nknow how to produce something else. \"The Ingratitude Revenged\" was not\nnonsense, nor was there any in \"The Numantia,\" nor any to be found in\n\"The Merchant Lover,\" nor yet in \"The Friendly Fair Foe,\" nor in some\nothers that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their own fame\nand renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;' some\nfurther remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him rather\ndumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could disabuse\nhim of his error.\"\n\n\"You have touched upon a subject, senor canon,\" observed the curate here,\n\"that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in vogue at the\npresent day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the books of\nchivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be the mirror\nof human life, the model of manners, and the image of the truth, those\nwhich are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, models of folly,\nand images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can there be in\nconnection with what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear\nin swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the\nsecond a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater absurdity can there be\nthan putting before us an old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a\npoltroon, a lackey using fine language, a page giving sage advice, a king\nplying as a porter, a princess who is a kitchen-maid? And then what shall\nI say of their attention to the time in which the action they represent\nmay or can take place, save that I have seen a play where the first act\nbegan in Europe, the second in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no\ndoubt, had it been in four acts, the fourth would have ended in America,\nand so it would have been laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if\ntruth to life is the main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it\npossible for any average understanding to be satisfied when the action is\nsupposed to pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the\nprincipal personage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who\nentered Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey\nof Bouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?\nor, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are introduced,\nor bits of what occurred to different people and at different times mixed\nup with it, all, not only without any semblance of probability, but with\nobvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable? And the\nworst of it is, there are ignorant people who say that this is\nperfection, and that anything beyond this is affected refinement. And\nthen if we turn to sacred dramas--what miracles they invent in them! What\napocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to one saint the miracles\nof another! And even in secular plays they venture to introduce miracles\nwithout any reason or object except that they think some such miracle, or\ntransformation as they call it, will come in well to astonish stupid\npeople and draw them to the play. All this tends to the prejudice of the\ntruth and the corruption of history, nay more, to the reproach of the\nwits of Spain; for foreigners who scrupulously observe the laws of the\ndrama look upon us as barbarous and ignorant, when they see the absurdity\nand nonsense of the plays we produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse\nto say that the chief object well-ordered governments have in view when\nthey permit plays to be performed in public is to entertain the people\nwith some harmless amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil\nhumours which idleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be\nattained by any sort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down\nlaws, or bind those who write or act them to make them as they ought to\nbe made, since, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any\nsort. To this I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all\ncomparison, better attained by means of good plays than by those that are\nnot so; for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play,\nthe hearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the\nserious parts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by\nthe arguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,\ninflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a\ngood play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or\ndull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with\nall these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much more\nthan one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which are\ncommonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed\nfor this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well aware of\ntheir faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays have become a\nsalable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy\nthem unless they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt\nhimself to the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work.\nAnd that this is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most\nfertile wit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so\nmuch grace and gaiety, such polished versification, such choice language,\nsuch profound reflections, and in a word, so rich in eloquence and\nelevation of style, that he has filled the world with his fame; and yet,\nin consequence of his desire to suit the taste of the actors, they have\nnot all, as some of them have, come as near perfection as they ought.\nOthers write plays with such heedlessness that, after they have been\nacted, the actors have to fly and abscond, afraid of being punished, as\nthey often have been, for having acted something offensive to some king\nor other, or insulting to some noble family. All which evils, and many\nmore that I say nothing of, would be removed if there were some\nintelligent and sensible person at the capital to examine all plays\nbefore they were acted, not only those produced in the capital itself,\nbut all that were intended to be acted in Spain; without whose approval,\nseal, and signature, no local magistracy should allow any play to be\nacted. In that case actors would take care to send their plays to the\ncapital, and could act them in safety, and those who write them would be\nmore careful and take more pains with their work, standing in awe of\nhaving to submit it to the strict examination of one who understood the\nmatter; and so good plays would be produced and the objects they aim at\nhappily attained; as well the amusement of the people, as the credit of\nthe wits of Spain, the interest and safety of the actors, and the saving\nof trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some\nother person were authorised to examine the newly written books of\nchivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have\ndescribed, enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure\nof eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light\nof the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not\nmerely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be always\nbent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful amusement.\"\n\nThe canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation,\nwhen the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to the curate,\n\"This is the spot, senor licentiate, that I said was a good one for fresh\nand plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.\"\n\n\"And so it seems,\" returned the curate, and he told the canon what he\nproposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,\nattracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;\nand to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he had\nbegun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the\ndoings of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the\ninn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there\nmight be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where\nhe was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which\nby this time ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to\nmake it unnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley.\n\n\"In that case,\" said the canon, \"take all the beasts there, and bring the\nsumpter mule back.\"\n\nWhile this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his\nmaster without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his\nsuspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don\nQuixote was placed, and said, \"Senor, to ease my conscience I want to\ntell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that\nthese two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village\nand the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying\nyou off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses\nthem in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you\nare not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I\nwant to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will\nanswer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will\nsee that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.\"\n\n\"Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for I will\nsatisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, that\nthese who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our\nneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to\nbe those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact,\nbelieve it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is\nthat, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who\nhave enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for\nenchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those of\nour friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into\na labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou\nhadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make me\nuncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to\nme; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate\nof our village are here in company with us, and on the other I find\nmyself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no power on earth\nthat was not supernatural would have been able to shut me in, what\nwouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment is of a sort\nthat transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal\nwith knights-errant that have been enchanted? So thou mayest set thy mind\nat rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest, for they are as\nmuch so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire to ask me something, say\non, and I will answer thee, though thou shouldst ask questions from this\ntill to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"May Our Lady be good to me!\" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; \"and is\nit possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains\nthat you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that malice\nhas more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment?\nBut as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted.\nNow tell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction, and so may you\nfind yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea-\"\n\n\"Leave off conjuring me,\" said Don Quixote, \"and ask what thou wouldst\nknow; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible\nprecision.\"\n\n\"That is what I want,\" said Sancho; \"and what I would know, and have you\ntell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the whole\ntruth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess\narms, as your worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant-\"\n\n\"I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,\" said Don Quixote; \"finish\nthy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations,\nrequirements, and precautions, Sancho.\"\n\n\"Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\" said Sancho; \"and\nso, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask,\nspeaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut up\nand, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or\ninclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?\"\n\n\"I do not understand 'going anywhere,'\" said Don Quixote; \"explain\nthyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to\nthe point.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship does not understand\n'going anywhere'? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were\nbabes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what\ncannot be avoided?\"\n\n\"Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"yes, often, and\neven this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS\nMASTER DON QUIXOTE\n\n\n\"Aha, I have caught you,\" said Sancho; \"this is what in my heart and soul\nI was longing to know. Come now, senor, can you deny what is commonly\nsaid around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't know what ails\nso-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a\nproper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted'? From\nwhich it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep,\nor do any of the natural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are\nenchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drink\nwhen drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and\nanswer every question that is asked them.\"\n\n\"What thou sayest is true, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but I have\nalready told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be\nthat in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and\nthat now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,\nthough they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw\ninferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am\nenchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh\nheavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a\nfaint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,\ndefrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and\ndistress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and\nprotection.\"\n\n\"Still for all that,\" replied Sancho, \"I say that, for your greater and\nfuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get\nout of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even\nto take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good\nRocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and\ndejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures\nagain; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the\ncage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to\nshut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate,\nor I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\"\n\n\"I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey\nthee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy\nconception of my misfortune.\"\n\nThe knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation\ntill they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber,\nwho had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at once\nunyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green\nspot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like\nDon Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged\nthe curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if\nthey did not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the\npropriety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate\nunderstood him, and said he would very gladly comply with his request,\nonly that he feared his master, finding himself at liberty, would take to\nhis old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again.\n\n\"I will answer for his not running away,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"And I also,\" said the canon, \"especially if he gives me his word as a\nknight not to leave us without our consent.\"\n\nDon Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \"I give it;-moreover\none who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he\nwho had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three\nages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\"--And\nthat being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would\nbe to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he\nprotested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless\nthey kept their distance.\n\nThe canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word\nand promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find\nhimself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch himself\nall over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him\na couple of slaps on the haunches said, \"I still trust in God and in his\nblessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see\nourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy\nback, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which God sent\nme into the world.\" And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he withdrew to\na retired spot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than\never to put his squire's scheme into execution.\n\nThe canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his\nmadness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such\nexcellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,\nwhen the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion,\nhe said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival\nof the provisions:\n\n\"Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books\nof chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset your\nreason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far\nfrom the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any human\nunderstanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity\nof Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all\nthose emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those\npalfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and\nmarvellous adventures, and enchantments of every kind, and battles, and\nprodigious encounters, splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires\nmade counts, droll dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings,\nswashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that nonsense the books of\nchivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that when I read them, so\nlong as I do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity, they\ngive me a certain amount of pleasure; but when I come to consider what\nthey are, I fling the very best of them at the wall, and would fling it\ninto the fire if there were one at hand, as richly deserving such\npunishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary\ntoleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of life, and teachers\nthat lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as truth all the\nfolly they contain. And such is their audacity, they even dare to\nunsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as is shown\nplainly by the way they have served your worship, when they have brought\nyou to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on\nan ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place to place to\nmake money by showing it. Come, Senor Don Quixote, have some compassion\nfor yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make use of the\nliberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you,\nemploying your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may\nserve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. And if, still\nled away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements\nand of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for\nthere you will find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are heroic.\nLusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an\nAlexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a\nGonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci\nPerez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to\nread of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest\nminds and fill them with delight and wonder. Here, Senor Don Quixote,\nwill be reading worthy of your sound understanding; from which you will\nrise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness,\nimproved in manners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice;\nand all to the honour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La\nMancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.\"\n\nDon Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon's words,\nand when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time, he\nreplied to him:\n\n\"It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is intended\nto persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, and\nthat all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless\nto the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in\nbelieving them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook to\nfollow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for\nyou deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other\nof the knights of whom the books are full.\"\n\n\"It is all exactly as you state it,\" said the canon; to which Don Quixote\nreturned, \"You also went on to say that books of this kind had done me\nmuch harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a\ncage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies,\nand read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and\ninstruction.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the canon.\n\n\"Well then,\" returned Don Quixote, \"to my mind it is you who are the one\nthat is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to utter such\nblasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as\ntrue that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment\nwhich you say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read\nthem. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the other\nknights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, would\nbe like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light, or ice\ncold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world can persuade another\nthat the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true,\nor that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the\ntime of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it is as true as that it is\ndaylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was a\nHector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur\nof England, who still lives changed into a raven, and is unceasingly\nlooked for in his kingdom. One might just as well try to make out that\nthe history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is\nfalse, or that the loves of Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal,\nas well as those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who\ncan almost remember having seen the Dame Quintanona, who was the best\ncupbearer in Great Britain. And so true is this, that I recollect a\ngrandmother of mine on the father's side, whenever she saw any dame in a\nvenerable hood, used to say to me, 'Grandson, that one is like Dame\nQuintanona,' from which I conclude that she must have known her, or at\nleast had managed to see some portrait of her. Then who can deny that the\nstory of Pierres and the fair Magalona is true, when even to this day may\nbe seen in the king's armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres\nguided the wooden horse he rode through the air, and it is a trifle\nbigger than the pole of a cart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's\nsaddle, and at Roncesvalles there is Roland's horn, as large as a large\nbeam; whence we may infer that there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres,\nand a Cid, and other knights like them, of the sort people commonly call\nadventurers. Or perhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such\nknight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to\nBurgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny,\nMosen Pierres by name, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen\nEnrique de Remesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and\nhonour; or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in\nBurgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of\nwhose family I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the\nsons of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de\nGuevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged in\ncombat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria. I\nshall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quinones, him of the 'Paso,'\nand the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian knight, Don\nGonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other\nachievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms, which are\nso authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must be totally\nwanting in reason and good sense.\"\n\nThe canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote\nuttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating\nor belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in\nreply:\n\n\"I cannot deny, Senor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you\nsay, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing\nto grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not\ndisposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop\nTurpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were knights\nchosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they were all\nequal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not they ought to\nhave been), and it was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago\nand Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those who\ntake it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we\nsay now a Knight of St. John, or of Alcantara, they used to say then a\nKnight of the Twelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that\nmilitary order. That there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio,\nthere can be no doubt; but that they did the deeds people say they did, I\nhold to be very doubtful. In that other matter of the pin of Count\nPierres that you speak of, and say is near Babieca's saddle in the\nArmoury, I confess my sin; for I am either so stupid or so short-sighted,\nthat, though I have seen the saddle, I have never been able to see the\npin, in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is.\"\n\n\"For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of\ncowhide to keep it from rusting.\"\n\n\"All that may be,\" replied the canon; \"but, by the orders I have\nreceived, I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there,\nthat is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those\nAmadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor is\nit reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so many\ngood qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should allow\nhimself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in\nthose absurd books of chivalry are really true.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nOF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD, TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER INCIDENTS\n\n\n\"A good joke, that!\" returned Don Quixote. \"Books that have been printed\nwith the king's licence, and with the approbation of those to whom they\nhave been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by\ngreat and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple,\nin a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they may\nbe--that these should be lies! And above all when they carry such an\nappearance of truth with them; for they tell us the father, mother,\ncountry, kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day\nby day, performed by such a knight or knights! Hush, sir; utter not such\nblasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to act as a sensible man\nshould; only read them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive\nfrom them. For, come, tell me, can there be anything more delightful than\nto see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling\npitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and\nterrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it, while from the\nmiddle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: 'Knight,\nwhosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the\nprize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy\nstout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters,\nelse thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the\nseven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;' and\nthen the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping\nto consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is\nexposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his\nmassive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into\nthe midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows\nwhat his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with\nwhich the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\n\n\"The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange\nbrilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself\nto the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is\nsoothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay\nplumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches. Here he sees\na brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands\nand white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls. There he\nperceives a cunningly wrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and\npolished marble; here another of rustic fashion where the little\nmussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail\ndisposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering\ncrystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where art,\nimitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\n\n\"Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous\npalace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of jacinth;\nin short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of\nwhich it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies,\npearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare. And after\nhaving seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of\ndamsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeous\nattire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the histories\ndescribe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she who seems\nto be the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into the\nboiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him leads him\ninto the rich palace or castle, and strips him as naked as when his\nmother bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all\nover with sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the\nsoftest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and\nthrows over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very\nleast a city, and even more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us\nhow, after all this, they lead him to another chamber where he finds the\ntables set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder;\nto see how they pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and\nsweet-scented flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how\nthe damsels wait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such\na variety of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a\nloss which to select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at\ntable, by whom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast\nis over and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair,\npicking his teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any\nof the others, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by\nhis side, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held\nenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the\nreaders who are perusing his history.\n\n\"But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered\nfrom it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one\nreads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;\nand take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you\nwill see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise your\nspirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since I have\nbeen a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred,\nmagnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned to\nbear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a\nshort time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, I\nhope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not,\nto see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the\ngratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, senor,\nthe poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to\nanyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude\nthat consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without\nworks is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to\noffer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my\nheart in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho\nPanza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly\ngive him a county I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am\nafraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm.\"\n\nSancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,\n\"Strive hard you, Senor Don Quixote, to give me that county so often\npromised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there\nwill be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I\nhave heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so\nmuch a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while\nthe lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him,\nwithout troubling himself about anything else. That's what I'll do, and\nnot stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole\nbusiness, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own\nway.\"\n\n\"That, brother Sancho,\" said the canon, \"only holds good as far as the\nenjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend\nto the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment\ncome in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if\nthis be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go\nwrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he\nfrustrates the evil designs of the crafty.\"\n\n\"I don't understand those philosophies,\" returned Sancho Panza; \"all I\nknow is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern\nit; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I\nshall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I\nshould do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and\npleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has\nnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is\nan end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let us see\none another, as one blind man said to the other.\"\n\n\"That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\" said the canon;\n\"but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of\ncounties.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \"I know not what more there is to be said;\nI only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul,\nwhen he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any\nscruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one\nof the best squires that ever knight-errant had.\"\n\nThe canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be\ncapable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had\ndescribed the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that\nthe deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he\nmarvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain\nthe county his master had promised him.\n\nBy this time the canon's servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the\nsumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of\nthe meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some\ntrees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived\nof the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As they were\neating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that\nseemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that were close\nby, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over\nblack, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after\nit, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn\nback to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards\nthe company as if seeking their protection and then stood still, and the\ngoatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if\nit were possessed of reason and understanding: \"Ah wanderer, wanderer,\nSpotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time? What wolves have\nfrightened you, my daughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my\nbeauty? But what else can it be except that you are a she, and cannot\nkeep quiet? A plague on your humours and the humours of those you take\nafter! Come back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy,\nat any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if\nyou who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will\nbecome of them?\"\n\nThe goatherd's talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon,\nwho said to him, \"As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such\na hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you\nsay, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to\nprevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe your\nirritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,\" and so\nsaying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.\n\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then\nsaid, \"I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpleton\nfor having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth is\nthere is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a clown, but not so\nmuch of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" said the curate, \"for I know already by\nexperience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds' harbour\nphilosophers.\"\n\n\"At all events, senor,\" returned the goatherd, \"they shelter men of\nexperience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though I\nmay seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will\nnot tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a\nlittle, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman's word\n(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\"\n\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \"Seeing that this affair has a certain\ncolour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most\ngladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they\npossess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and\nentertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So begin,\nfriend, for we are all prepared to listen.\"\n\n\"I draw my stakes,\" said Sancho, \"and will retreat with this pasty to the\nbrook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I have\nheard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant's squire should eat\nuntil he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it often\nhappens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot\nfind a way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or\nhis alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very often he does,\nturned into a dried mummy.\"\n\n\"Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"go where thou\nwilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to give\nmy mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow's\nstory.\"\n\n\"It is what we shall all do,\" said the canon; and then begged the\ngoatherd to begin the promised tale.\n\nThe goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps\non the back, saying, \"Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time\nenough to return to our fold.\" The goat seemed to understand him, for as\nher master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him and\nlooked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he was\ngoing to say, and then in these words he began his story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nWHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DON\nQUIXOTE\n\n\nThree leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small, is\none of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived a\nfarmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so\nis the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected for\nhis virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him still\nmore fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such\nexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that\neveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts\nwith which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was\nbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she\nwas most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through\nall the villages around--but why do I say the villages around, merely,\nwhen it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of\nroyalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all\nsides to see her as if to see something rare and curious, or some\nwonder-working image?\n\nHer father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are\nno locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than\nher own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter\nled many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he,\nas one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was\nperplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless\nsuitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who felt a desire\nso natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was of the same\ntown, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions,\nI had great hopes of success. There was another of the same place and\nqualifications who also sought her, and this made her father's choice\nhang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us his daughter would\nbe well bestowed; so to escape from this state of perplexity he resolved\nto refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the name of the rich damsel\nwho has reduced me to misery), reflecting that as we were both equal it\nwould be best to leave it to his dear daughter to choose according to her\ninclination--a course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish\nto settle their children in life. I do not mean that they ought to leave\nthem to make a choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they\nshould place before them what is good and then allow them to make a good\nchoice as they please. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her\nfather put us both off with the tender age of his daughter and vague\nwords that neither bound him nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo\nand I myself Eugenio--that you may know the names of the personages that\nfigure in this tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it\nis plain to see it must be disastrous.\n\nAbout this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the son\nof a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned from\nservice as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain who\nchanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from our\nvillage when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve years\nlater the young man came back in a soldier's uniform, arrayed in a\nthousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains.\nTo-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all\nflimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth. The peasant folk,\nwho are naturally malicious, and when they have nothing to do can be\nmalice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his finery and\njewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had three suits of\ndifferent colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he made so\nmany arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had not\ncounted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a display of more\nthan ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not look upon all this\nthat I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, for\nthey have a great deal to do with the story. He used to seat himself on a\nbench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would keep us all\nhanging open-mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits. There was\nno country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle he had\nnot been engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco\nand Tunis, and fought more single combats, according to his own account,\nthan Garcilaso, Diego Garcia de Paredes and a thousand others he named,\nand out of all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On\nthe other hand he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be\nmade out, he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and\nactions. Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say \"you\" to his\nequals and even those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was\nhis father and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as\ngood as the king himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a\ntrifle of a musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that\nsome said he made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he\nwas something of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the\ntown he made a ballad a league long.\n\nThis soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this\nbravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra\nfrom a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of\nhis showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave\naway twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his exploits which\nhe told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no\ndoubt had arranged it, she fell in love with him before the presumption\nof making love to her had suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairs\nnone are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the\ninclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente came to an\nunderstanding without any difficulty; and before any of her numerous\nsuitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already carried it into\neffect, having left the house of her dearly beloved father (for mother\nshe had none), and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who\ncame more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the\nlarge number he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it\nwere amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her\nfather full of grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a\nferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads,\nthey searched the woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days\nthey found the flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift,\nand robbed of all the money and precious jewels she had carried away from\nhome with her.\n\nThey brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to her\nmisfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca\nhad deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to\nleave her father's house, as he meant to take her to the richest and most\ndelightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she,\nill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, and\nhanded over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had carried\nher away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the eave where they had\nfound her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her of\nher honour, had taken from her everything she had, and made off, leaving\nher in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody. It was\nnot easy for us to credit the young man's continence, but she asserted it\nwith such earnestness that it helped to console her distressed father,\nwho thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost\ncan never be recovered had been left to his daughter. The same day that\nLeandra made her appearance her father removed her from our sight and\ntook her away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this, in the\nhope that time may wear away some of the disgrace she has incurred.\nLeandra's youth furnished an excuse for her fault, at least with those to\nwhom it was of no consequence whether she was good or bad; but those who\nknew her shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour\nto ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women,\nwhich is for the most part flighty and ill-regulated.\n\nLeandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo's eyes grew blind, or at any rate\nfound nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in\ndarkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable\nwhile Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew\nless; we cursed the soldier's finery and railed at the carelessness of\nLeandra's father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and\ncome to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own,\nand I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees,\ngiving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra's praises,\nor upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring forth our\ncomplaints in solitude. Following our example, many more of Leandra's\nlovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life,\nand they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned\ninto the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds;\nnor is there a spot in it where the name of the fair Leandra is not\nheard. Here one curses her and calls her capricious, fickle, and\nimmodest, there another condemns her as frail and frivolous; this pardons\nand absolves her, that spurns and reviles her; one extols her beauty,\nanother assails her character, and in short all abuse her, and all adore\nher, and to such a pitch has this general infatuation gone that there are\nsome who complain of her scorn without ever having exchanged a word with\nher, and even some that bewail and mourn the raging fever of jealousy,\nfor which she never gave anyone cause, for, as I have already said, her\nmisconduct was known before her passion. There is no nook among the\nrocks, no brookside, no shade beneath the trees that is not haunted by\nsome shepherd telling his woes to the breezes; wherever there is an echo\nit repeats the name of Leandra; the mountains ring with \"Leandra,\"\n\"Leandra\" murmur the brooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and\nbewitched, hoping without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear.\nOf all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the most\nsense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain\nof, he only complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a\nrebeck, which he plays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that\nshow his ingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser\ncourse, and that is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their\ninconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises, their unkept\npledges, and in short the want of reflection they show in fixing their\naffections and inclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and\nexpressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as\nshe is a female I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all\nmy fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been\ntedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close\nby, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety\nof toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nOF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THE\nRARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT HE\nBROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION\n\n\nThe goatherd's tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the\ncanon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular\nattention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the\nmanner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit;\nand he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the\nwoods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio\nbut he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who\nsaid to him, \"Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a\nposition to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on\nyour behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt\nshe is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might\ntry to prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her\naccording to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of\nchivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to\nany damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that the might of one malignant\nenchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better\ndisposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and\nassistance, as I am bound to do by my profession, which is none other\nthan to give aid to the weak and needy.\"\n\nThe goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote's sorry appearance and\nlooks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him,\n\"Senor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a\nstrain?\"\n\n\"Who should it be,\" said the barber, \"but the famous Don Quixote of La\nMancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of\ndamsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\"\n\n\"That,\" said the goatherd, \"sounds like what one reads in the books of\nthe knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is\nmy belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty\nlodgings in his head.\"\n\n\"You are a great scoundrel,\" said Don Quixote, \"and it is you who are\nempty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore\nyou;\" and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near\nhim and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force that he\nflattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and\nfound himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to\ncarpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him\nby the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not\nSancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the\nshoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,\nand upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, finding\nhimself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face\ncovered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours\nfeeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with.\nThe canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so\ncontrived it that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him\nsuch a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight's face streamed with\nblood as freely as his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with\nlaughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and\nthe other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in\na fight. Sancho alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the\ngrasp of one of the canon's servants, who kept him from going to his\nmaster's assistance.\n\nAt last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who\nwere mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet\nsound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction\nwhence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by\nhearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was\nunder the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said\nto him, \"Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one\nsince thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask\nthee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder\ntrumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new\nadventure.\" The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and\nbeing pummelled, released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet\nand turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard,\nsuddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white\nlike penitents.\n\nThe fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from\nthe earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising\nprocessions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of\nhis mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that\nwas hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one\nside of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of the\npenitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it\ninto his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him\nalone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more\nconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they\nhad with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and\ndiscourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurred\nto him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and\ntaking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled\nin an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante,\nbraced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who\nstood by, \"Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that\nthere should be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry;\nnow, I say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is\nborne captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in\nestimation,\" and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante--for\nhe had no spurs--and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history\nwe never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the\npenitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent\nhim. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts\nof Sancho calling after him, \"Where are you going, Senor Don Quixote?\nWhat devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith?\nPlague take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady\nthey are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the\nimmaculate Virgin. Take care what you are doing, senor, for this time it\nmay be safely said you don't know what you are about.\" Sancho laboured in\nvain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted\nfigures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and\neven had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered\nhim. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was\nalready anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse,\nexcited voice he exclaimed, \"You who hide your faces, perhaps because you\nare not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say\nto you.\" The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and\none of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the\nstrange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other\nludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, \"Brother, if\nyou have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are\nwhipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should\nstop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two\nwords.\"\n\n\"I will say it in one,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and it is this; that at\nonce, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad\naspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and\nthat ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who\nwas born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit\nyou to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty\nshe pines for and deserves.\"\n\nFrom these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and\nbegan to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don\nQuixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush\nat the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his\ncomrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had\nfor propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty\ncut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion\nthat remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don\nQuixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the\nclownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad\nplight.\n\nSancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing\nhim fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was\na poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his\nlife; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's shouting, but seeing\nthat Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had\nkilled him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to\nhis heels across the country like a deer.\n\nBy this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay;\nbut the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the\nofficers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,\nand clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their\nscourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,\nresolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against\ntheir assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter\nbetter than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his\nmaster's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable\nlamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The curate\nwas known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their\nrecognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties;\nthe first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he\nand the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was\ndead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his eyes, \"Oh flower\nof chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy\nwell-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha,\nnay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers,\nno longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! Oh thou, generous\nabove all the Alexanders, since for only eight months of service thou\nhast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds! Humble with the\nproud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of\noutrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the\nwicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can\nbe said!\"\n\nAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the\nfirst word he said was, \"He who lives separated from you, sweetest\nDulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend\nSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press\nthe saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.\"\n\n\"That I will do with all my heart, senor,\" said Sancho; \"and let us\nreturn to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there\nwe will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more\nprofitable and creditable to us.\"\n\n\"Thou art right, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote; \"It will be wise to let\nthe malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.\"\n\nThe canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely\nin doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's\nsimplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The\nprocession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;\nthe goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood\ndeclined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to\nthem; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did,\nwhether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then\nbegged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and\nwent their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, Don\nQuixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything\nwith as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen and\nmade Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual\ndeliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six\ndays they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about the middle\nof the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in\nthe plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart passed. They all flocked to\nsee what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they\nwere filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his\nhousekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all\nlean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was\npiteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their\nbreasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of\nchivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at\nthe gate.\n\nAt the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running,\nfor she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his\nsquire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the\nass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.\n\n\"Thanks be to God,\" said she, \"for being so good to me; but now tell me,\nmy friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you\nbrought me back? What shoes for your children?\"\n\n\"I bring nothing of that sort, wife,\" said Sancho; \"though I bring other\nthings of more consequence and value.\"\n\n\"I am very glad of that,\" returned his wife; \"show me these things of\nmore value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my\nheart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been\naway.\"\n\n\"I will show them to you at home, wife,\" said Sancho; \"be content for the\npresent; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in\nsearch of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an\nisland, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to\nbe had.\"\n\n\"Heaven grant it, husband,\" said she, \"for indeed we have need of it. But\ntell me, what's this about islands, for I don't understand it?\"\n\n\"Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,\" returned Sancho; \"all in good\ntime thou shalt see, wife--nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself\ncalled 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and\nvassals?\" returned Teresa Panza--for so Sancho's wife was called, though\nthey were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to\ntake their husbands' surnames.\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \"it is\nenough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may\ntell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more\ndelightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a\nknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one\nfinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,\nninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,\nfor out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,\nfor all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may\nhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting\ncastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the\nmaravedi to pay.\"\n\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don\nQuixote's housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid\nhim in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he\nwas. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle\ncomfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape\nfrom them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring\nhim home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed\ntheir maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to\nplunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the\nbottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their\nuncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself\nsomewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.\n\nBut the author of this history, though he has devoted research and\nindustry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his\nthird sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them,\nat any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely\npreserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third\ntime he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where\nhe was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and\nthat he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence.\nOf his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have\nascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old\nphysician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which,\naccording to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling\nfoundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box\nwere found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in\nCastilian verse, containing many of his achievements, and setting forth\nthe beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho\nPanza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry\nepitaphs and eulogies on his life and character; but all that could be\nread and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new\nand unparalleled history here presents. And the said author asks of those\nthat shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost\nhim in examining and searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring\nit to light, save that they give him the same credit that people of sense\ngive to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular;\nfor with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied,\nand will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories, if not as\ntruthful, at least equal in invention and not less entertaining. The\nfirst words written on the parchment found in the leaden box were these:\n\n\n      THE ACADEMICIANS OF\n   ARGAMASILLA, A VILLAGE OF\n           LA MANCHA,\n     ON THE LIFE AND DEATH\n   OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA,\n        HOC SCRIPSERUNT\nMONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\n\n\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\nEPITAPH\n\nThe scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more\n  Rich spoils than Jason's; who a point so keen\n  Had to his wit, and happier far had been\nIf his wit's weathercock a blunter bore;\nThe arm renowned far as Gaeta's shore,\n  Cathay, and all the lands that lie between;\n  The muse discreet and terrible in mien\nAs ever wrote on brass in days of yore;\nHe who surpassed the Amadises all,\n  And who as naught the Galaors accounted,\n    Supported by his love and gallantry:\nWho made the Belianises sing small,\n  And sought renown on Rocinante mounted;\n    Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.\n\n\n\nPANIAGUADO,\nACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nIN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSO\n\nSONNET\n\nShe, whose full features may be here descried,\n  High-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,\n  Is Dulcinea, she for whom in vain\nThe great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.\nFor her, Toboso's queen, from side to side\n  He traversed the grim sierra, the champaign\n  Of Aranjuez, and Montiel's famous plain:\nOn Rocinante oft a weary ride.\nMalignant planets, cruel destiny,\n  Pursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,\nAnd the unconquered star of chivalry.\n  Nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim\nOf death; he paid love's bitter penalty,\n  And left the marble to preserve his name.\n\n\n\nCAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN\nOF ARGAMASILLA, IN PRAISE OF ROCINANTE,\nSTEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\n\nSONNET\n\nOn that proud throne of diamantine sheen,\n  Which the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,\nThe mad Manchegan's banner now hath been\n  By him in all its bravery displayed.\n  There hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade\nWherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,\n  He slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made\nA novel style for our new paladin.\nIf Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,\n  If by his progeny the fame of Greece\n    Through all the regions of the earth be spread,\nGreat Quixote crowned in grim Bellona's hall\n  To-day exalts La Mancha over these,\n    And above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.\nNor ends his glory here, for his good steed\nDoth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;\nAs mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,\nThe reputation they have won is scanty.\n\nBURLADOR, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON SANCHO PANZA\n\nSONNET\n\n  The worthy Sancho Panza here you see;\n    A great soul once was in that body small,\n    Nor was there squire upon this earthly ball\nSo plain and simple, or of guile so free.\nWithin an ace of being Count was he,\n    And would have been but for the spite and gall\n    Of this vile age, mean and illiberal,\nThat cannot even let a donkey be.\nFor mounted on an ass (excuse the word),\n    By Rocinante's side this gentle squire\n      Was wont his wandering master to attend.\nDelusive hopes that lure the common herd\n    With promises of ease, the heart's desire,\n      In shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.\n\n\n\n\nCACHIDIABLO,\nACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\nEPITAPH\n\nThe knight lies here below,\n  Ill-errant and bruised sore,\n  Whom Rocinante bore\nIn his wanderings to and fro.\nBy the side of the knight is laid\n  Stolid man Sancho too,\n  Than whom a squire more true\nWas not in the esquire trade.\n\n            TIQUITOC,\n   ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\n\n           EPITAPH\nHere Dulcinea lies.\n  Plump was she and robust:\n  Now she is ashes and dust:\nThe end of all flesh that dies.\nA lady of high degree,\n  With the port of a lofty dame,\n  And the great Don Quixote's flame,\nAnd the pride of her village was she.\n\nThese were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the writing\nbeing worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academicians to make out\ntheir meaning conjecturally.

QUIXOTE\n\n\nPART II.\n\n\nDEDICATION OF PART II.\n\nTO THE COUNT OF LEMOS:\n\nThese days past, when sending Your Excellency my plays, that had appeared\nin print before being shown on the stage, I said, if I remember well,\nthat Don Quixote was putting on his spurs to go and render homage to Your\nExcellency. Now I say that \"with his spurs, he is on his way.\" Should he\nreach destination methinks I shall have rendered some service to Your\nExcellency, as from many parts I am urged to send him off, so as to\ndispel the loathing and disgust caused by another Don Quixote who, under\nthe name of Second Part, has run masquerading through the whole world.\nAnd he who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great\nEmperor of China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent\nit by a special courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to\nsend him Don Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the\nSpanish tongue would be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be\nread should be the History of Don Quixote. He also added that I should go\nand be the rector of this college. I asked the bearer if His Majesty had\nafforded a sum in aid of my travel expenses. He answered, \"No, not even\nin thought.\"\n\n\"Then, brother,\" I replied, \"you can return to your China, post haste or\nat whatever haste you are bound to go, as I am not fit for so long a\ntravel and, besides being ill, I am very much without money, while\nEmperor for Emperor and Monarch for Monarch, I have at Naples the great\nCount of Lemos, who, without so many petty titles of colleges and\nrectorships, sustains me, protects me and does me more favour than I can\nwish for.\"\n\nThus I gave him his leave and I beg mine from you, offering Your\nExcellency the \"Trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda,\" a book I shall finish\nwithin four months, Deo volente, and which will be either the worst or\nthe best that has been composed in our language, I mean of those intended\nfor entertainment; at which I repent of having called it the worst, for,\nin the opinion of friends, it is bound to attain the summit of possible\nquality. May Your Excellency return in such health that is wished you;\nPersiles will be ready to kiss your hand and I your feet, being as I am,\nYour Excellency's most humble servant.\n\nFrom Madrid, this last day of October of the year one thousand six\nhundred and fifteen.\n\nAt the service of Your Excellency:\n\nMIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAAVEDRA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\n\n\nTHE AUTHOR'S PREFACE\n\nGod bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must\nthou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there\nretaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second Don\nQuixote--I mean him who was, they say, begotten at Tordesillas and born\nat Tarragona! Well then, the truth is, I am not going to give thee that\nsatisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in\nmine the rule must admit of an exception. Thou wouldst have me call him\nass, fool, and malapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be\nhis punishment, with his bread let him eat it, and there's an end of it.\nWhat I cannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old and\none-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing over\nme, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern,\nand not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the\nfuture can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's\neye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who know\nwhere they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage dead\nin battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, that\nif now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would\nrather have had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my\nwounds this minute without having been present at it. Those the soldier\nshows on his face and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven\nof honour and ambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be\nobserved that it is not with grey hairs that one writes, but with the\nunderstanding, and that commonly improves with years. I take it amiss,\ntoo, that he calls me envious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant,\nwhat envy is; for really and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only\nknow that which is holy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it\nis, I am not likely to attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he\nholds the rank of familiar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did\non account of him on whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely\nmistaken; for I worship the genius of that person, and admire his works\nand his unceasing and strenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to\nthis gentleman, the author, for saying that my novels are more satirical\nthan exemplary, but that they are good; for they could not be that unless\nthere was a little of everything in them.\n\nI suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keeping\nmyself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling that\nadditional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and that\nwhat this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he\ndoes not dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but\nhides his name and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some\nlese majesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell him from\nme that I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the\ntemptations of the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it\ninto a man's head that he can write and print a book by which he will get\nas much fame as money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will\nbeg of you, in your own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him this story.\n\nThere was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurdities\nand vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It was this: he\nmade a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street,\nor wherever it might be, he with his foot held one of its legs fast, and\nwith his hand lifted up the other, and as best he could fixed the tube\nwhere, by blowing, he made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in\nthis position, he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go,\nsaying to the bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): \"Do your\nworships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?\"--Does\nyour worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?\n\nAnd if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him this\none, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.\n\nIn Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece of\nmarble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when he\ncame upon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight\nfall right on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and\nhowling, would run three streets without stopping. It so happened,\nhowever, that one of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a\ncap-maker's dog, of which his master was very fond. The stone came down\nhitting it on the head, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw\nthe affair and was wroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at\nthe madman and did not leave a sound bone in his body, and at every\nstroke he gave him he said, \"You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don't you\nsee, you brute, that my dog is a lurcher?\" and so, repeating the word\n\"lurcher\" again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The\nmadman took the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month\nnever once showed himself in public; but after that he came out again\nwith his old trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where\nthere was a dog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let\nthe stone fall, he said: \"This is a lurcher; ware!\" In short, all the\ndogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were lurchers;\nand he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same with this\nhistorian; that he will not venture another time to discharge the weight\nof his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones. Tell him,\ntoo, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me of\ndepriving me of my profit by means of his book; for, to borrow from the\nfamous interlude of \"The Perendenga,\" I say in answer to him, \"Long life\nto my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.\" Long life to the\ngreat Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity and well-known generosity\nsupport me against all the strokes of my curst fortune; and long life to\nthe supreme benevolence of His Eminence of Toledo, Don Bernardo de\nSandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be no printing-presses in the\nworld, or if they print more books against me than there are letters in\nthe verses of Mingo Revulgo! These two princes, unsought by any adulation\nor flattery of mine, of their own goodness alone, have taken it upon them\nto show me kindness and protect me, and in this I consider myself happier\nand richer than if Fortune had raised me to her greatest height in the\nordinary way. The poor man may retain honour, but not the vicious;\npoverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannot hide it altogether;\nand as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, even though it be through\nthe straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteem of lofty and noble\nspirits, and in consequence their protection. Thou needst say no more to\nhim, nor will I say anything more to thee, save to tell thee to bear in\nmind that this Second Part of \"Don Quixote\" which I offer thee is cut by\nthe same craftsman and from the same cloth as the First, and that in it I\npresent thee Don Quixote continued, and at length dead and buried, so\nthat no one may dare to bring forward any further evidence against him,\nfor that already produced is sufficient; and suffice it, too, that some\nreputable person should have given an account of all these shrewd\nlunacies of his without going into the matter again; for abundance, even\nof good things, prevents them from being valued; and scarcity, even in\nthe case of what is bad, confers a certain value. I was forgetting to\ntell thee that thou mayest expect the \"Persiles,\" which I am now\nfinishing, and also the Second Part of \"Galatea.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nOF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS\nMALADY\n\n\nCide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third\nsally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly\na month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to his\nrecollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visit\nhis niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him\nwith attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were\ngood for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his\nmisfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so,\nand meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they could\nperceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of\nbeing in his right mind. This gave great satisfaction to the curate and\nthe barber, for they concluded they had taken the right course in\ncarrying him off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the\nFirst Part of this great as well as accurate history, in the last chapter\nthereof. So they resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in\nhis condition, although they thought it almost impossible that there\ncould be any; and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with\nknight-errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which were\nstill so tender.\n\nThey came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a\ngreen baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried up\nthat he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were very\ncordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he talked\nto them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen language. In\nthe course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they call\nState-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse and\ncondemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each of\nthe three setting up for a new legislator, a modern Lycurgus, or a\nbrand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that they\nseemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quite\ndifferent from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealt\nwith, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examiners\nwere fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.\n\nThe niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could not\nfind words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their master\nso clear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original plan,\nwhich was to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test\nDon Quixote's recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine or\nnot; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of the\nnews that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said it\nwas considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a powerful\nfleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the great storm\nwould burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, which\nalmost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty had made\nprovision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily and the\nisland of Malta.\n\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \"His Majesty has acted like a prudent\nwarrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that the\nenemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I would\nrecommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his Majesty\nis very far from thinking of.\"\n\nThe moment the curate heard this he said to himself, \"God keep thee in\nhis hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitating\nthyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thy\nsimplicity.\"\n\nBut the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked Don\nQuixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought to\nbe adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to be\nadded to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were in\nthe habit of offering to princes.\n\n\"Mine, master shaver,\" said Don Quixote, \"will not be impertinent, but,\non the contrary, pertinent.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" said the barber, \"but that experience has shown that\nall or most of the expedients which are proposed to his Majesty are\neither impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the King and to the\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"Mine, however,\" replied Don Quixote, \"is neither impossible nor absurd,\nbut the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiest and most expeditious\nthat could suggest itself to any projector's mind.\"\n\n\"You take a long time to tell it, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the curate.\n\n\"I don't choose to tell it here, now,\" said Don Quixote, \"and have it\nreach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some\nother carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said the barber, \"I give my word here and before God that\nI will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly\nman--an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the\nprelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred\ngold crowns and his pacing mule.\"\n\n\"I am not versed in stories,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I know the oath is a\ngood one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.\"\n\n\"Even if he were not,\" said the curate, \"I will go bail and answer for\nhim that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of\npaying any penalty that may be pronounced.\"\n\n\"And who will be security for you, senor curate?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"My profession,\" replied the curate, \"which is to keep secrets.\"\n\n\"Ods body!\" said Don Quixote at this, \"what more has his Majesty to do\nbut to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are\nscattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even\nif no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone\nwill suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me your\nattention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a single\nknight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they\nall had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me, how\nmany histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an evil\nhour for me: I don't speak for anyone else) the famous Don Belianis were\nalive now, or any one of the innumerable progeny of Amadis of Gaul! If\nany these were alive today, and were to come face to face with the Turk,\nby my faith, I would not give much for the Turk's chance. But God will\nhave regard for his people, and will provide some one, who, if not so\nvaliant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be inferior to\nthem in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" exclaimed the niece at this, \"may I die if my master does not\nwant to turn knight-errant again;\" to which Don Quixote replied, \"A\nknight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he\nlikes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows what\nI mean.\" But here the barber said, \"I ask your worships to give me leave\nto tell a short story of something that happened in Seville, which comes\nso pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly to tell it.\"\nDon Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he began\nthus:\n\n\"In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had placed\nthere as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canon law;\nbut even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of most people\nthat he would have been mad all the same. This graduate, after some years\nof confinement, took it into his head that he was sane and in his full\nsenses, and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop, entreating him\nearnestly, and in very correct language, to have him released from the\nmisery in which he was living; for by God's mercy he had now recovered\nhis lost reason, though his relations, in order to enjoy his property,\nkept him there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him out to be mad\nuntil his dying day. The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible,\nwell-written letters, directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of\nthe madhouse as to the truth of the licentiate's statements, and to have\nan interview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he\nwas in his senses, to take him out and restore him to liberty. The\nchaplain did so, and the governor assured him that the man was still mad,\nand that though he often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would\nin the end break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality\ncounterbalanced all the sensible things he had said before, as might be\neasily tested by talking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the\nexperiment, and obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an\nhour or more, during the whole of which time he never uttered a word that\nwas incoherent or absurd, but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that\nthe chaplain was compelled to believe him to be sane. Among other things,\nhe said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents his\nrelations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals;\nand that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property;\nfor in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the\nmercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a\nman. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the\ngovernor, and made his relations appear covetous and heartless, and\nhimself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with\nhim that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for himself the\ntruth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain\nbegged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had\nentered the house given to him. The governor again bade him beware of\nwhat he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad; but\nall his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain\nfrom taking him away. The governor, seeing that it was the order of the\nArchbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes,\nwhich were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw himself clothed like one\nin his senses, and divested of the appearance of a madman, entreated the\nchaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades\nthe madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen\nthere were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of\nthose who were present. Approaching a cage in which there was a furious\nmadman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to\nhim, 'Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going\nhome, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy,\nwithout any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in\nmy senses, for with God's power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope\nand trust in him, for as he has restored me to my original condition, so\nlikewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to\nsend you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would\nhave you know I am convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all\nthis madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains\nfull of wind. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune\nbreaks down health and brings on death.'\n\n\"To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite\nthat of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old\nmat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was that\nwas going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate answered, 'It is\nI, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer,\nfor which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy\nupon me.'\n\n\"'Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don't let the devil deceive you,'\nreplied the madman. 'Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will save\nyourself the trouble of coming back.'\n\n\"'I know I am cured,' returned the licentiate, 'and that I shall not have\nto go stations again.'\n\n\"'You cured!' said the madman; 'well, we shall see; God be with you; but\nI swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that for\nthis crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing you\nfrom this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall\nhave to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages\nand ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable little licentiate,\nthat I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my\nhands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont to threaten and\nlay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish this ignorant\ntown, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district\nor territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned from the day and\nmoment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou cured, thou in thy\nsenses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending\nrain as of hanging myself.\n\n\"Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the\nmadman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by\nthe hands, said to him, 'Be not uneasy, senor; attach no importance to\nwhat this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain,\nI, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often\nas it pleases me and may be needful.'\n\n\"The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the\nchaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, 'For all that, Senor Neptune,\nit will not do to vex Senor Jupiter; remain where you are, and some other\nday, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back\nfor you.' So they stripped the licentiate, and he was left where he was;\nand that's the end of the story.\"\n\n\"So that's the story, master barber,\" said Don Quixote, \"which came in so\npat to the purpose that you could not help telling it? Master shaver,\nmaster shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve. Is it\npossible that you do not know that comparisons of wit with wit, valour\nwith valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are always odious and\nunwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of the waters, nor\ndo I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I am not one. My\nonly endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake it makes in not\nreviving in itself the happy time when the order of knight-errantry was\nin the field. But our depraved age does not deserve to enjoy such a\nblessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upon their\nshoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of damsels, the succour\nof orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and the recompense\nof the humble. With the knights of these days, for the most part, it is\nthe damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they wear, that rustle as they go,\nnot the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleeps in the\nopen field exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoply from\nhead to foot; no one now takes a nap, as they call it, without drawing\nhis feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his lance, as the\nknights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetrates\nyonder mountains, and then treads the barren, lonely shore of the\nsea--mostly a tempestuous and stormy one--and finding on the beach a\nlittle bark without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the\nintrepidity of his heart flings himself into it and commits himself to\nthe wrathful billows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him up to\nheaven and the next plunge him into the depths; and opposing his breast\nto the irresistible gale, finds himself, when he least expects it, three\nthousand leagues and more away from the place where he embarked; and\nleaping ashore in a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve\nto be written, not on parchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs\nover energy, indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over\ncourage, and theory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone\nonly in the golden ages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more\nvirtuous and more valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more\ndiscreet than Palmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than\nTirante el Blanco? Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more\nslashed or slashing than Don Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of\nGaul? Who more ready to face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more\nsincere than Esplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of\nThrace? Who more bold than Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino?\nWho more daring than Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who\nmore gallant and courteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara\nof the present day are descended, according to Turpin in his\n'Cosmography.' All these knights, and many more that I could name, senor\ncurate, were knights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or\nsuch as these, I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his\nMajesty would find himself well served and would save great expense, and\nthe Turk would be left tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am,\nas the chaplain does not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has\ntold us, will not send rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please. I\nsay this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber, \"I did not mean it in that\nway, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship ought\nnot to be vexed.\"\n\n\"As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,\" returned Don Quixote, \"I\nmyself am the best judge.\"\n\nHereupon the curate observed, \"I have hardly said a word as yet; and I\nwould gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has\nsaid, that worries and works my conscience.\"\n\n\"The senor curate has leave for more than that,\" returned Don Quixote,\n\"so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on\none's conscience.\"\n\n\"Well then, with that permission,\" said the curate, \"I say my doubt is\nthat, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of\nknights-errant you, Senor Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and\ntruly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the\ncontrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and\ndreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.\"\n\n\"That is another mistake,\" replied Don Quixote, \"into which many have\nfallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world,\nand I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions, tried to\nexpose this almost universal error to the light of truth. Sometimes I\nhave not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have, supporting it\nupon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear that I can\nalmost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of\nlofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a\ncountenance between gentle and stern in expression, sparing of words,\nslow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and as I have depicted\nAmadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all the knights-errant\nthat are in all the histories in the world; for by the perception I have\nthat they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did\nand the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of\nsound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and stature.\"\n\n\"How big, in your worship's opinion, may the giant Morgante have been,\nSenor Don Quixote?\" asked the barber.\n\n\"With regard to giants,\" replied Don Quixote, \"opinions differ as to\nwhether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy Scripture,\nwhich cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when\nit gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who was seven\ncubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. Likewise, in the\nisland of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large\nthat their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall\nas great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all\nthat, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I\nsuspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this\nopinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly\nmentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses\nto contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything\nexcessive.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing\nsuch nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features of\nReinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers\nof France, for they were all knights-errant.\n\n\"As for Reinaldos,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I venture to say that he was\nbroad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent\neyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of\nthieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or Orlando\n(for the histories call him by all these names), I am of opinion, and\nhold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather bow-legged,\nswarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe\nexpression of countenance, a man of few words, but very polite and\nwell-bred.\"\n\n\"If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship has\ndescribed,\" said the curate, \"it is no wonder that the fair Lady Angelica\nrejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, and grace of that\nbudding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered herself; and she\nshowed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness of Medoro\nrather than the roughness of Roland.\"\n\n\"That Angelica, senor curate,\" returned Don Quixote, \"was a giddy damsel,\nflighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world as full of her\nvagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorn a thousand\ngentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with a smooth-faced\nsprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except such reputation for\ngratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him. The great poet\nwho sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to sing her\nadventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably were not over\nand above creditable), dropped her where he says:\n\nHow she received the sceptre of Cathay,\nSome bard of defter quill may sing some day;\n\nand this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called\nvates, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for since\nthen a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and\nanother famous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the barber here, \"among all those who\npraised her, has there been no poet to write a satire on this Lady\nAngelica?\"\n\n\"I can well believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that if Sacripante or Roland\nhad been poets they would have given the damsel a trimming; for it is\nnaturally the way with poets who have been scorned and rejected by their\nladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by those whom they select as\nthe ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves in satires and\nlibels--a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generous hearts; but up to\nthe present I have not heard of any defamatory verse against the Lady\nAngelica, who turned the world upside down.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" said the curate; but at this moment they heard the housekeeper\nand the niece, who had previously withdrawn from the conversation,\nexclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they all ran out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DON\nQUIXOTE'S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS\n\n\nThe history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and the\nbarber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to\nSancho, who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while\nthey held the door against him, \"What does the vagabond want in this\nhouse? Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that\ndelude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the\ncountry.\"\n\nTo which Sancho replied, \"Devil's own housekeeper! it is I who am\ndeluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not\nthy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily\nmistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an\nisland, which I am still waiting for.\"\n\n\"May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\" said the niece;\n\"What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that\nthou art?\"\n\n\"It is not something to eat,\" replied Sancho, \"but something to govern\nand rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.\"\n\n\"For all that,\" said the housekeeper, \"you don't enter here, you bag of\nmischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your\nseed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.\"\n\nThe curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of\nthe three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out\na whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might\nnot be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two\nhold their tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the curate\nand the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they\ndespaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how\nsaturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate\nto the barber, \"You will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of\nit, our gentleman will be off once more for another flight.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" returned the barber; \"but I do not wonder so\nmuch at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire, who\nhas such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose all\nthe exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his head.\"\n\n\"God help them,\" said the curate; \"and let us be on the look-out to see\nwhat comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it\nseems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness of\nthe master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a\nfarthing.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the barber, \"and I should like very much to know\nwhat the pair are talking about at this moment.\"\n\n\"I promise you,\" said the curate, \"the niece or the housekeeper will tell\nus by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.\"\n\nMeanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when\nthey were alone he said to him, \"It grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou\nshouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy cottage, when\nthou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied forth together, we\ntook the road together, we wandered abroad together; we have had the same\nfortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, they belaboured\nme a hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have of thee.\"\n\n\"That was only reasonable,\" replied Sancho, \"for, by what your worship\nsays, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errant than to their\nsquires.\"\n\n\"Thou art mistaken, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"according to the maxim\nquando caput dolet, etc.\"\n\n\"I don't understand any language but my own,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"I mean to say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that when the head suffers all the\nmembers suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I am thy head, and\nthou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore any evil that\naffects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and what affects thee\ngive pain to me.\"\n\n\"It should be so,\" said Sancho; \"but when I was blanketed as a member, my\nhead was on the other side of the wall, looking on while I was flying\nthrough the air, and did not feel any pain whatever; and if the members\nare obliged to feel the suffering of the head, it should be obliged to\nfeel their sufferings.\"\n\n\"Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that I did not\nfeel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must not say so\nor think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst in body.\nBut let us put that aside for the present, for we shall have\nopportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,\nSancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What do\nthe common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do the\ncaballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of my\ncourtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving and\nrestoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,\nSancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on this\nsubject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good or\ntaking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals to\ntell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape, not\nallowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And I\nwould have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by\nflattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and\nother ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be\nthe golden of these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and\nreport to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest\ntouching what I have demanded of thee.\"\n\n\"That I will do with all my heart, master,\" replied Sancho, \"provided\nyour worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish me to say it\nout in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than it\ncame to my knowledge in.\"\n\n\"I will not be vexed at all,\" returned Don Quixote; \"thou mayest speak\nfreely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said he, \"first of all, I have to tell you that the common\npeople consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less a\nfool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds of your\nquality of gentleman, you have assumed the 'Don,' and made a knight of\nyourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple of acres of land,\nand never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they do not want to\nhave hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly squire\nhidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with\ngreen silk.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"does not apply to me, for I always go well\ndressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from the wear\nand tear of arms than of time.\"\n\n\"As to your worship's valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there\nis a variety of opinions. Some say, 'mad but droll;' others, 'valiant but\nunlucky;' others, 'courteous but meddling,' and then they go into such a\nnumber of things that they don't leave a whole bone either in your\nworship or in myself.\"\n\n\"Recollect, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that wherever virtue exists in an\neminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of the famous men that have\nlived escaped being calumniated by malice. Julius Caesar, the boldest,\nwisest, and bravest of captains, was charged with being ambitious, and\nnot particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in his morals. Of\nAlexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say that he was\nsomewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many labours, it is said\nthat he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of\nGaul, it was whispered that he was over-quarrelsome, and of his brother\nthat he was lachrymose. So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumnies\nagainst good men, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thou\nhast said.\"\n\n\"That's just where it is, body of my father!\"\n\n\"Is there more, then?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"There's the tail to be skinned yet,\" said Sancho; \"all so far is cakes\nand fancy bread; but if your worship wants to know all about the\ncalumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you one this instant who\ncan tell you the whole of them without missing an atom; for last night\nthe son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying at Salamanca, came\nhome after having been made a bachelor, and when I went to welcome him,\nhe told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with\nthe title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA; and he\nsays they mention me in it by my own name of Sancho Panza, and the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we\nwere alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who\nwrote them down could have known them.\"\n\n\"I promise thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of our history\nwill be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to\nwrite about is hidden.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Sancho, \"a sage and an enchanter! Why, the bachelor Samson\nCarrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says the author of the\nhistory is called Cide Hamete Berengena.\"\n\n\"That is a Moorish name,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"May be so,\" replied Sancho; \"for I have heard say that the Moors are\nmostly great lovers of berengenas.\"\n\n\"Thou must have mistaken the surname of this 'Cide'--which means in\nArabic 'Lord'--Sancho,\" observed Don Quixote.\n\n\"Very likely,\" replied Sancho, \"but if your worship wishes me to fetch\nthe bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for\nwhat thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall not eat a morsel that\nwill agree with me until I have heard all about it.\"\n\n\"Then I am off for him,\" said Sancho; and leaving his master he went in\nquest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time, and, all\nthree together, they had a very droll colloquy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nOF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHO\nPANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO\n\n\nDon Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelor\nCarrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a\nbook as Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such\nhistory could be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had slain\nwas not yet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to make\nout that his mighty achievements were going about in print. For all that,\nhe fancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid of\nmagic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify and\nexalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight-errant; if\nan enemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest ever\nrecorded of any low squire, though as he said to himself, the\nachievements of squires never were recorded. If, however, it were the\nfact that such a history were in existence, it must necessarily, being\nthe story of a knight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand\nand true. With this he comforted himself somewhat, though it made him\nuncomfortable to think that the author was a Moor, judging by the title\nof \"Cide;\" and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are\nall impostors, cheats, and schemers. He was afraid he might have dealt\nwith his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to the\ndiscredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; he\nwould have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always\nobserved towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all\nsorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.\nAbsorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he was\nfound by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with great\ncourtesy.\n\nThe bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,\nbut he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but very\nsharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a round\nface, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievous\ndisposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he gave a sample as\nsoon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees before him and\nsaying, \"Let me kiss your mightiness's hand, Senor Don Quixote of La\nMancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear, though I have no more\nthan the first four orders, your worship is one of the most famous\nknights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over. A\nblessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written the history of your\ngreat deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took the\ntrouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilian\nvulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!\"\n\nDon Quixote made him rise, and said, \"So, then, it is true that there is\na history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?\"\n\n\"So true is it, senor,\" said Samson, \"that my belief is there are more\nthan twelve thousand volumes of the said history in print this very day.\nOnly ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they have been printed,\nand moreover there is a report that it is being printed at Antwerp, and I\nam persuaded there will not be a country or language in which there will\nnot be a translation of it.\"\n\n\"One of the things,\" here observed Don Quixote, \"that ought to give most\npleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to find himself in his lifetime\nin print and in type, familiar in people's mouths with a good name; I say\nwith a good name, for if it be the opposite, then there is no death to be\ncompared to it.\"\n\n\"If it goes by good name and fame,\" said the bachelor, \"your worship\nalone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for the Moor in\nhis own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to set before\nus your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, your\nfortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as\nwounds, the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship\nand my lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso-\"\n\n\"I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Dona,\" observed Sancho here;\n\"nothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so here already the\nhistory is wrong.\"\n\n\"That is not an objection of any importance,\" replied Carrasco.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me, senor bachelor, what\ndeeds of mine are they that are made most of in this history?\"\n\n\"On that point,\" replied the bachelor, \"opinions differ, as tastes do;\nsome swear by the adventure of the windmills that your worship took to be\nBriareuses and giants; others by that of the fulling mills; one cries up\nthe description of the two armies that afterwards took the appearance of\ntwo droves of sheep; another that of the dead body on its way to be\nburied at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galley slaves is\nthe best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to the affair with\nthe Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant Biscayan.\"\n\n\"Tell me, senor bachelor,\" said Sancho at this point, \"does the adventure\nwith the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante went hankering after\ndainties?\"\n\n\"The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,\" replied Samson; \"he tells\nall and sets down everything, even to the capers that worthy Sancho cut\nin the blanket.\"\n\n\"I cut no capers in the blanket,\" returned Sancho; \"in the air I did, and\nmore of them than I liked.\"\n\n\"There is no human history in the world, I suppose,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"that has not its ups and downs, but more than others such as deal with\nchivalry, for they can never be entirely made up of prosperous\nadventures.\"\n\n\"For all that,\" replied the bachelor, \"there are those who have read the\nhistory who say they would have been glad if the author had left out some\nof the countless cudgellings that were inflicted on Senor Don Quixote in\nvarious encounters.\"\n\n\"That's where the truth of the history comes in,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"At the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,\"\nobserved Don Quixote; \"for there is no need of recording events which do\nnot change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring the\nhero of it into contempt. AEneas was not in truth and earnest so pious as\nVirgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Samson; \"but it is one thing to write as a poet,\nanother to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things,\nnot as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has\nto write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were,\nwithout adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"if this senor Moor goes in for telling the\ntruth, no doubt among my master's drubbings mine are to be found; for\nthey never took the measure of his worship's shoulders without doing the\nsame for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my\nmaster himself says, the members must share the pain of the head.\"\n\n\"You are a sly dog, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"i' faith, you have no\nwant of memory when you choose to remember.\"\n\n\"If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\" said Sancho, \"my\nweals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.\"\n\n\"Hush, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't interrupt the bachelor, whom\nI entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history.\"\n\n\"And about me,\" said Sancho, \"for they say, too, that I am one of the\nprincipal presonages in it.\"\n\n\"Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\" said Samson.\n\n\"What! Another word-catcher!\" said Sancho; \"if that's to be the way we\nshall not make an end in a lifetime.\"\n\n\"May God shorten mine, Sancho,\" returned the bachelor, \"if you are not\nthe second person in the history, and there are even some who would\nrather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there\nare some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing\nthere was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by\nSenor Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"There is still sunshine on the wall,\" said Don Quixote; \"and when Sancho\nis somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that years bring,\nhe will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he is at\npresent.\"\n\n\"By God, master,\" said Sancho, \"the island that I cannot govern with the\nyears I have, I'll not be able to govern with the years of Methuselah;\nthe difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, I\nknow not where; and not that there is any want of head in me to govern\nit.\"\n\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for all will be and perhaps\nbetter than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God's will.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Samson; \"and if it be God's will, there will not be\nany want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to govern.\"\n\n\"I have seen governors in these parts,\" said Sancho, \"that are not to be\ncompared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called 'your\nlordship' and served on silver.\"\n\n\"Those are not governors of islands,\" observed Samson, \"but of other\ngovernments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least\nknow grammar.\"\n\n\"I could manage the gram well enough,\" said Sancho; \"but for the mar I\nhave neither leaning nor liking, for I don't know what it is; but leaving\nthis matter of the government in God's hands, to send me wherever it may\nbe most to his service, I may tell you, senor bachelor Samson Carrasco,\nit has pleased me beyond measure that the author of this history should\nhave spoken of me in such a way that what is said of me gives no offence;\nfor, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said anything about me that\nwas at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as I am, the deaf would have\nheard of it.\"\n\n\"That would be working miracles,\" said Samson.\n\n\"Miracles or no miracles,\" said Sancho, \"let everyone mind how he speaks\nor writes about people, and not set down at random the first thing that\ncomes into his head.\"\n\n\"One of the faults they find with this history,\" said the bachelor, \"is\nthat its author inserted in it a novel called 'The Ill-advised\nCuriosity;' not that it is bad or ill-told, but that it is out of place\nand has nothing to do with the history of his worship Senor Don Quixote.\"\n\n\"I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,\"\nsaid Sancho.\n\n\"Then, I say,\" said Don Quixote, \"the author of my history was no sage,\nbut some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way, set\nabout writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, the\npainter of Ubeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was\npainting, answered, 'What it may turn out.' Sometimes he would paint a\ncock in such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside of\nit in Gothic letters, 'This is a cock; and so it will be with my history,\nwhich will require a commentary to make it intelligible.\"\n\n\"No fear of that,\" returned Samson, \"for it is so plain that there is\nnothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young\npeople read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in a\nword, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all\nsorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, 'There goes\nRocinante.' And those that are most given to reading it are the pages,\nfor there is not a lord's ante-chamber where there is not a 'Don Quixote'\nto be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one pounces\nupon it, and that begs for it. In short, the said history is the most\ndelightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen,\nfor there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an\nimmodest word, or a thought that is other than Catholic.\"\n\n\"To write in any other way,\" said Don Quixote, \"would not be to write\ntruth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought\nto be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what could\nhave led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories,\nwhen he had so much to write about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by\nthe proverb 'with straw or with hay, etc,' for by merely setting forth my\nthoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might\nhave made a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado\nwould make up. In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, senor bachelor, is,\nthat to write histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great\njudgment and a ripe understanding. To give expression to humour, and\nwrite in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses.\nThe cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make\npeople take him for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a\nsacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God\nis; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books\nbroadcast on the world as if they were fritters.\"\n\n\"There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\" said the\nbachelor.\n\n\"No doubt of that,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but it often happens that those\nwho have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by their\nwritings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give\nthem to the press.\"\n\n\"The reason of that,\" said Samson, \"is, that as printed works are\nexamined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the\nfame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Men famous for\ntheir genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always, or most\ncommonly, envied by those who take a particular delight and pleasure in\ncriticising the writings of others, without having produced any of their\nown.\"\n\n\"That is no wonder,\" said Don Quixote; \"for there are many divines who\nare no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detecting the defects or\nexcesses of those who preach.\"\n\n\"All that is true, Senor Don Quixote,\" said Carrasco; \"but I wish such\nfault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay so\nmuch attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble\nat; for if aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus, they should remember how\nlong he remained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade\nas possible; and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be\nmoles, that sometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them;\nand so I say very great is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes\nhimself, for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that\nwill satisfy and please all readers.\"\n\n\"That which treats of me must have pleased few,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Quite the contrary,\" said the bachelor; \"for, as stultorum infinitum est\nnumerus, innumerable are those who have relished the said history; but\nsome have brought a charge against the author's memory, inasmuch as he\nforgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho's Dapple; for it is not\nstated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that he was\nstolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the same ass,\nwithout any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot to state\nwhat Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise in\nthe Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and there are many\nwho would be glad to know what he did with them, or what he spent them\non, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.\"\n\n\"Senor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or\nexplanations,\" said Sancho; \"for there's a sinking of the stomach come\nover me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff it\nwill put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and my old\nwoman is waiting for me; after dinner I'll come back, and will answer you\nand all the world every question you may choose to ask, as well about the\nloss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;\" and without\nanother word or waiting for a reply he made off home.\n\nDon Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with\nhim. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of young\npigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,\nCarrasco fell in with his host's humour, the banquet came to an end, they\ntook their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their conversation was\nresumed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nIN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS AND\nQUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS\nWORTH KNOWING AND TELLING\n\n\nSancho came back to Don Quixote's house, and returning to the late\nsubject of conversation, he said, \"As to what Senor Samson said, that he\nwould like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, I say in\nreply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flying from the\nHoly Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galley slaves, and\nthe other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my master and I\nensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning on his\nlance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the late frays\nwe fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and I in\nparticular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to come and\nprop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of the\npack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took away\nDapple from under me without my feeling it.\"\n\n\"That is an easy matter,\" said Don Quixote, \"and it is no new occurrence,\nfor the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siege of Albracca; the\nfamous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took his horse from\nbetween his legs.\"\n\n\"Day came,\" continued Sancho, \"and the moment I stirred the stakes gave\nway and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; I looked about for\nthe ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to my eyes and I raised\nsuch a lamentation that, if the author of our history has not put it in,\nhe may depend upon it he has left out a good thing. Some days after, I\nknow not how many, travelling with her ladyship the Princess Micomicona,\nI saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress of a gipsy, was that\nGines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that my master and I freed\nfrom the chain.\"\n\n\"That is not where the mistake is,\" replied Samson; \"it is, that before\nthe ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho as being mounted on\nit.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say to that,\" said Sancho, \"unless that the\nhistorian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of the\nprinter's.\"\n\n\"No doubt that's it,\" said Samson; \"but what became of the hundred\ncrowns? Did they vanish?\"\n\nTo which Sancho answered, \"I spent them for my own good, and my wife's,\nand my children's, and it is they that have made my wife bear so\npatiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of my\nmaster, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to the\nhouse without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poor\nlook-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, here\nI am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair of\nanyone's whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did not\nspend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be\npaid for in money, even if they were valued at no more than four\nmaravedis apiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of\nthem. Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and\nblack white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\"\n\n\"I will take care,\" said Carrasco, \"to impress upon the author of the\nhistory that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy\nSancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else to correct in the history, senor bachelor?\" asked\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"No doubt there is,\" replied he; \"but not anything that will be of the\nsame importance as those I have mentioned.\"\n\n\"Does the author promise a second part at all?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"He does promise one,\" replied Samson; \"but he says he has not found it,\nnor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear\nor not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever\nbeen good, and others that enough has been already written about Don\nQuixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are\njovial rather than saturnine, say, 'Let us have more Quixotades, let Don\nQuixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we\nshall be satisfied with that.'\"\n\n\"And what does the author mean to do?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"What?\" replied Samson; \"why, as soon as he has found the history which\nhe is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once\ngive it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him\nfrom doing so than by any thought of praise.\"\n\nWhereat Sancho observed, \"The author looks for money and profit, does he?\nIt will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry, hurry,\nwith him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurry are\nnever finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master Moor, or\nwhatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and my master\nwill give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way of\nadventures and accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one\nsecond part, but a hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are\nfast asleep in the straw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod\nand he will see which foot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if my\nmaster would take my advice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages\nand righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.\"\n\nSancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fell\nupon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, and\nhe resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.\nAnnouncing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the\nquarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor\nreplied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, and\nthe city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at\nthe festival of St. George, at which he might win renown above all the\nknights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of the\nworld. He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, but\nadmonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers,\nbecause his life did not belong to him, but to all those who had need of\nhim to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.\n\n\"There's where it is, what I abominate, Senor Samson,\" said Sancho here;\n\"my master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a\ndozen melons. Body of the world, senor bachelor! there is a time to\nattack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always 'Santiago, and\nclose Spain!' Moreover, I have heard it said (and I think by my master\nhimself, if I remember rightly) that the mean of valour lies between the\nextremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, I don't want him\nto fly without having good reason, or to attack when the odds make it\nbetter not. But, above all things, I warn my master that if he is to take\nme with him it must be on the condition that he is to do all the\nfighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anything except what\nconcerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in this I will dance\nattendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even against\nrascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. I don't set up to be a\nfighting man, Senor Samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that\never served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in consideration\nof my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the\nmany his worship says one may stumble on in these parts, I will take it\nas a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, I was born like\neveryone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except\nGod; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even\nbetter, without a government than if I were a governor; and how do I know\nbut that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for\nme, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out? Sancho\nI was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all that, if heaven were to\nmake me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without\nmuch trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it;\nfor they say, too, 'when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and\n'when good luck comes to thee, take it in.'\"\n\n\"Brother Sancho,\" said Carrasco, \"you have spoken like a professor; but,\nfor all that, put your trust in God and in Senor Don Quixote, for he will\ngive you a kingdom, not to say an island.\"\n\n\"It is all the same, be it more or be it less,\" replied Sancho; \"though I\ncan tell Senor Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he\nmight give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and\nI find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I\nhave before now told my master as much.\"\n\n\"Take care, Sancho,\" said Samson; \"honours change manners, and perhaps\nwhen you find yourself a governor you won't know the mother that bore\nyou.\"\n\n\"That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\" said Sancho,\n\"not of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on\ntheir souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely\nto show ingratitude to anyone?\"\n\n\"God grant it,\" said Don Quixote; \"we shall see when the government\ncomes; and I seem to see it already.\"\n\nHe then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of\ncomposing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of\nhis lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was\nplaced at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,\n\"Dulcinea del Toboso\" might be read by putting together the first\nletters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous\npoets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he would not\nfail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great difficulty in\nthe task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he\nmade four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter\nover, and if he made them of five, what they called decimas or\nredondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he would try to\ndrop a letter as well as he could, so that the name \"Dulcinea del Toboso\"\nmight be got into four ballad stanzas.\n\n\"It must be, by some means or other,\" said Don Quixote, \"for unless the\nname stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses\nwere made for her.\"\n\nThey agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three\ndays from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a\nsecret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his\nniece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his\npraiseworthy and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took\nhis leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil\nfortunes whenever he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other\nfarewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for\ntheir expedition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nOF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA AND\nHIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED\n\n\nThe translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth\nchapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza\nspeaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his\nlimited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it\npossible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what\nhis task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and\ntherefore he went on to say:\n\nSancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his\nhappiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, \"What have\nyou got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?\"\n\nTo which he replied, \"Wife, if it were God's will, I should be very glad\nnot to be so well pleased as I show myself.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you, husband,\" said she, \"and I don't know what you\nmean by saying you would be glad, if it were God's will, not to be well\npleased; for, fool as I am, I don't know how one can find pleasure in not\nhaving it.\"\n\n\"Hark ye, Teresa,\" replied Sancho, \"I am glad because I have made up my\nmind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to go\nout a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him again,\nfor my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with\nthe thought that I may find another hundred crowns like those we have\nspent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and\nif God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at\nhome, without taking me out into the byways and cross-roads--and he could\ndo it at small cost by merely willing it--it is clear my happiness would\nbe more solid and lasting, for the happiness I have is mingled with\nsorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying I would be glad, if\nit were God's will, not to be well pleased.\"\n\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Teresa; \"ever since you joined on to a\nknight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no\nunderstanding you.\"\n\n\"It is enough that God understands me, wife,\" replied Sancho; \"for he is\nthe understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, you must\nlook to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he may be fit\nto take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle and other\nharness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go round the\nworld, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and monsters,\nand hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; and even all\nthis would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesans and\nenchanted Moors.\"\n\n\"I know well enough, husband,\" said Teresa, \"that squires-errant don't\neat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to our Lord\nto deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, wife,\" said Sancho, \"if I did not expect to see myself\ngovernor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.\"\n\n\"Nay, then, husband,\" said Teresa; \"let the hen live, though it be with\nher pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world;\nyou came out of your mother's womb without a government, you have lived\nuntil now without a government, and when it is God's will you will go, or\nbe carried, to your grave without a government. How many there are in the\nworld who live without a government, and continue to live all the same,\nand are reckoned in the number of the people. The best sauce in the world\nis hunger, and as the poor are never without that, they always eat with a\nrelish. But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you should find yourself with\nsome government, don't forget me and your children. Remember that\nSanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he should go to school, if\nhis uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained for the Church.\nConsider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not die of grief if we\nmarry her; for I have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a husband\nas you to get a government; and, after all, a daughter looks better ill\nmarried than well whored.\"\n\n\"By my faith,\" replied Sancho, \"if God brings me to get any sort of a\ngovernment, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for Mari-Sancha\nthat there will be no approaching her without calling her 'my lady.\"\n\n\"Nay, Sancho,\" returned Teresa; \"marry her to her equal, that is the\nsafest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high-heeled\nshoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, out\nof the plain 'Marica' and 'thou,' into 'Dona So-and-so' and 'my lady,'\nthe girl won't know where she is, and at every turn she will fall into a\nthousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun\nstuff.\"\n\n\"Tut, you fool,\" said Sancho; \"it will be only to practise it for two or\nthree years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily as a\nglove; and if not, what matter? Let her be 'my lady,' and never mind what\nhappens.\"\n\n\"Keep to your own station, Sancho,\" replied Teresa; \"don't try to raise\nyourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says, 'wipe the nose\nof your neigbbour's son, and take him into your house.' A fine thing it\nwould be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some great count or grand\ngentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse her and call her\nclown-bred and clodhopper's daughter and spinning wench. I have not been\nbringing up my daughter for that all this time, I can tell you, husband.\nDo you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her to my care; there\nis Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho's son, a stout, sturdy young fellow that we\nknow, and I can see he does not look sour at the girl; and with him, one\nof our own sort, she will be well married, and we shall have her always\nunder our eyes, and be all one family, parents and children,\ngrandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing of God will\ndwell among us; so don't you go marrying her in those courts and grand\npalaces where they won't know what to make of her, or she what to make of\nherself.\"\n\n\"Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,\" said Sancho, \"what do you mean by\ntrying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying my daughter to\none who will give me grandchildren that will be called 'your lordship'?\nLook ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders say that he who does not\nknow how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him, has no right to\ncomplain if it gives him the go-by; and now that it is knocking at our\ndoor, it will not do to shut it out; let us go with the favouring breeze\nthat blows upon us.\"\n\nIt is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the\ntranslator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.\n\n\"Don't you see, you animal,\" continued Sancho, \"that it will be well for\nme to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the\nmire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find\nyourself called 'Dona Teresa Panza,' and sitting in church on a fine\ncarpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the\nborn ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor\nless, like a tapestry figure--Let us say no more about it, for Sanchica\nshall be a countess, say what you will.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of all you say, husband?\" replied Teresa. \"Well, for all\nthat, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin.\nYou do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I can tell\nyou it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a lover of\nequality, brother, and I can't bear to see people give themselves airs\nwithout any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple\nname, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Donas; Cascajo\nwas my father's name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza,\nthough by right I ought to be called Teresa Cascajo; but 'kings go where\nlaws like,' and I am content with this name without having the 'Don' put\non top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don't want\nto make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess\nor governor's wife; for they will say at once, 'See what airs the slut\ngives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, and used to\ngo to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of a\nmantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and\nairs, as if we didn't know her!' If God keeps me in my seven senses, or\nfive, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a\npass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger\nas much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter\nnor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman\nshould have a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy at something is\na virtuous damsel's holiday; be off to your adventures along with your\nDon Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them\nfor us according as we deserve it. I don't know, I'm sure, who fixed the\n'Don' to him, what neither his father nor grandfather ever had.\"\n\n\"I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!\" said Sancho. \"God\nhelp thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, one after the\nother, without head or tail! What have Cascajo, and the broaches and the\nproverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Look here, fool and dolt\n(for so I may call you, when you don't understand my words, and run away\nfrom good fortune), if I had said that my daughter was to throw herself\ndown from a tower, or go roaming the world, as the Infanta Dona Urraca\nwanted to do, you would be right in not giving way to my will; but if in\nan instant, in less than the twinkling of an eye, I put the 'Don' and 'my\nlady' on her back, and take her out of the stubble, and place her under a\ncanopy, on a dais, and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the\nAlmohades of Morocco ever had in their family, why won't you consent and\nfall in with my wishes?\"\n\n\"Do you know why, husband?\" replied Teresa; \"because of the proverb that\nsays 'who covers thee, discovers thee.' At the poor man people only throw\na hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if the said rich\nman was once on a time poor, it is then there is the sneering and the\ntattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streets here they swarm as\nthick as bees.\"\n\n\"Look here, Teresa,\" said Sancho, \"and listen to what I am now going to\nsay to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do not give\nmy own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of his\nreverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and who\nsaid, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes\nbehold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on our\nmemory much better and more forcibly than things past.\"\n\nThese observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account\nof which the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal,\ninasmuch as they are beyond Sancho's capacity.\n\n\"Whence it arises,\" he continued, \"that when we see any person well\ndressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants,\nit seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory may\nat the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have\nseen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low birth, being\nnow a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only thing that has\nany existence is what we see before us; and if this person whom fortune\nhas raised from his original lowly state (these were the very words the\npadre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred, generous,\ncourteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of\nancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember what he was,\nand everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the envious, from\nwhom no fair fortune is safe.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, husband,\" replied Teresa; \"do as you like, and\ndon't break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if you\nhave revolved to do what you say-\"\n\n\"Resolved, you should say, woman,\" said Sancho, \"not revolved.\"\n\n\"Don't set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,\" said Teresa; \"I speak\nas God pleases, and don't deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if\nyou are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you, and\nteach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons ought to\ninherit and learn the trades of their fathers.\"\n\n\"As soon as I have the government,\" said Sancho, \"I will send for him by\npost, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for\nthere is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have\nnot got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him\nlook what he is to be.\"\n\n\"You send the money,\" said Teresa, \"and I'll dress him up for you as fine\nas you please.\"\n\n\"Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"The day that I see her a countess,\" replied Teresa, \"it will be the same\nto me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you please, for\nwe women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands,\nthough they be dogs;\" and with this she began to weep in earnest, as if\nshe already saw Sanchica dead and buried.\n\nSancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he\nwould put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an\nend, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for\ntheir departure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nOF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER; ONE\nOF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY\n\n\nWhile Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above\nirrelevant conversation, Don Quixote's niece and housekeeper were not\nidle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and\nmaster meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake\nhimself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by all the\nmeans in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it\nwas all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. Nevertheless,\namong many other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to\nhim, \"In truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home,\nand give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit,\nlooking for what they say are called adventures, but what I call\nmisfortunes, I shall have to make complaint to God and the king with loud\nsupplication to send some remedy.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"What answer God will give to your\ncomplaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer\neither; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the\nnumberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the\ngreatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to\nall and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of\nmine should worry him.\"\n\nWhereupon the housekeeper said, \"Tell us, senor, at his Majesty's court\nare there no knights?\"\n\n\"There are,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and plenty of them; and it is right\nthere should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the\ngreater glory of the king's majesty.\"\n\n\"Then might not your worship,\" said she, \"be one of those that, without\nstirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?\"\n\n\"Recollect, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"all knights cannot be\ncourtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.\nThere must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be all knights,\nthere is a great difference between one and another; for the courtiers,\nwithout quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court, range the\nworld over by looking at a map, without its costing them a farthing, and\nwithout suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we, the true\nknights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet, exposed to the\nsun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies of heaven, by day and\nnight, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only know enemies in pictures,\nbut in their own real shapes; and at all risks and on all occasions we\nattack them, without any regard to childish points or rules of single\ncombat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance or sword, whether one\ncarries relics or any secret contrivance about him, whether or not the\nsun is to be divided and portioned out, and other niceties of the sort\nthat are observed in set combats of man to man, that you know nothing\nabout, but I do. And you must know besides, that the true knight-errant,\nthough he may see ten giants, that not only touch the clouds with their\nheads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two tall towers by\nway of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships, and each\neye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than a glass furnace,\nmust not on any account be dismayed by them. On the contrary, he must\nattack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and a fearless heart,\nand, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even though they have for\narmour the shells of a certain fish, that they say are harder than\ndiamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades of Damascus\nsteel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I have more\nthan once seen. All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see the\ndifference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and it\nwould be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value on\nthis second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant;\nfor, as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who\nhave been the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.\"\n\n\"Ah, senor,\" here exclaimed the niece, \"remember that all this you are\nsaying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; and their histories, if\nindeed they were not burned, would deserve, each of them, to have a\nsambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might be known as infamous\nand a corrupter of good manners.\"\n\n\"By the God that gives me life,\" said Don Quixote, \"if thou wert not my\nfull niece, being daughter of my own sister, I would inflict a\nchastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered that all the\nworld should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy that hardly\nknows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongue and\ncriticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Senor Amadis say if\nhe heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee, for\nhe was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, and\nmoreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might have\nheard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; for\nthey are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditioned\nscoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is so\nin all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look like\ngentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men\nof low rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and\nhigh gentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low\nrank; the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues,\nthe latter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices;\nand one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two\nkinds of gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" said the niece, \"that you should know so much,\nuncle--enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and go preach in the\nstreets--and yet that you should fall into a delusion so great and a\nfolly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorous when you are\nold, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what is crooked\nwhen you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballero when you\nare not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men are nothing of the\nkind!\"\n\n\"There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,\" returned Don\nQuixote, \"and I could tell you somewhat about birth that would astonish\nyou; but, not to mix up things human and divine, I refrain. Look you, my\ndears, all the lineages in the world (attend to what I am saying) can be\nreduced to four sorts, which are these: those that had humble beginnings,\nand went on spreading and extending themselves until they attained\nsurpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings and maintained\nthem, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of their origin; those,\nagain, that from a great beginning have ended in a point like a pyramid,\nhaving reduced and lessened their original greatness till it has come to\nnought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively to its base or\nfoundation, is nothing; and then there are those--and it is they that are\nthe most numerous--that have had neither an illustrious beginning nor a\nremarkable mid-course, and so will have an end without a name, like an\nordinary plebeian line. Of the first, those that had an humble origin and\nrose to the greatness they still preserve, the Ottoman house may serve as\nan example, which from an humble and lowly shepherd, its founder, has\nreached the height at which we now see it. For examples of the second\nsort of lineage, that began with greatness and maintains it still without\nadding to it, there are the many princes who have inherited the dignity,\nand maintain themselves in their inheritance, without increasing or\ndiminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limits of their states. Of\nthose that began great and ended in a point, there are thousands of\nexamples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, the Caesars of\nRome, and the whole herd (if I may apply such a word to them) of countless\nprinces, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, and\nbarbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point and\ncome to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it would\nbe impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should we\nfind one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeian\nlineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell the\nnumber of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to any\nfame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you gather,\nmy poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and that\nonly those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so\nby the virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors. I have said\nvirtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will\nbe a great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be\nmerely a miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by\npossessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he pleases, but\nby knowing how to spend it well. The poor gentleman has no way of showing\nthat he is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred,\ncourteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, or\ncensorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis given\nwith a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as he\nwho distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him to\nbe endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he know him not,\nwill fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it\nwould be strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of\nvirtue, and those who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation.\nThere are two roads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and\nhonours; one is that of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of\narms than of letters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to\narms, was born under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore,\nin a measure constrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in\nspite of all the world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me\nto resist what heaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above\nall, my own inclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils\nthat are the accompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite\nblessings that are attained by it; I know that the path of virtue is very\nnarrow, and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and\ngoals are different, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death,\nand the narrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory\nlife, but in that which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet\nsays, that--\n\nIt is by rugged paths like these they go\nThat scale the heights of immortality,\nUnreached by those that falter here below.\"\n\n\"Woe is me!\" exclaimed the niece, \"my lord is a poet, too! He knows\neverything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if he chose to turn\nmason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, niece,\" replied Don Quixote, \"if these chivalrous\nthoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would be nothing that I\ncould not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would not come from my\nhands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.\"\n\nAt this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked who\nwas there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant the\nhousekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see\nhim; in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his\nmaster Don Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the\npair shut themselves up in his room, where they had another conversation\nnot inferior to the previous one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nOF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER\nVERY NOTABLE INCIDENTS\n\n\nThe instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her\nmaster, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the result\nof the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, she\nseized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find the\nbachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man,\nand a new friend of her master's, he might be able to persuade him to\ngive up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the patio of his\nhouse, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment she\nsaw him.\n\nCarrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her, \"What\nis this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One would think\nyou heart-broken.\"\n\n\"Nothing, Senor Samson,\" said she, \"only that my master is breaking out,\nplainly breaking out.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts is he breaking out, senora?\" asked Samson; \"has any part of\nhis body burst?\"\n\n\"He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,\" she replied; \"I\nmean, dear senor bachelor, that he is going to break out again (and this\nwill be the third time) to hunt all over the world for what he calls\nventures, though I can't make out why he gives them that name. The first\ntime he was brought back to us slung across the back of an ass, and\nbelaboured all over; and the second time he came in an ox-cart, shut up\nin a cage, in which he persuaded himself he was enchanted, and the poor\ncreature was in such a state that the mother that bore him would not have\nknown him; lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deep in the cells of his\nskull; so that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more\nthan six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the world, and my hens too,\nthat won't let me tell a lie.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" replied the bachelor, \"for they are so good\nand so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for\nanother, though they were to burst for it. In short then, mistress\nhousekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what it\nis feared Don Quixote may do?\"\n\n\"No, senor,\" said she.\n\n\"Well then,\" returned the bachelor, \"don't be uneasy, but go home in\npeace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on the\nway say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if you know it; for I will\ncome presently and you will see miracles.\"\n\n\"Woe is me,\" cried the housekeeper, \"is it the prayer of Santa Apollonia\nyou would have me say? That would do if it was the toothache my master\nhad; but it is in the brains, what he has got.\"\n\n\"I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don't set\nyourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca, and\none can't be more of a bachelor than that,\" replied Carrasco; and with\nthis the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for the\ncurate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.\n\nWhile Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion\nwhich the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.\nSancho said to his master, \"Senor, I have educed my wife to let me go\nwith your worship wherever you choose to take me.\"\n\n\"Induced, you should say, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"not educed.\"\n\n\"Once or twice, as well as I remember,\" replied Sancho, \"I have begged of\nyour worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what I mean\nby them; and if you don't understand them to say 'Sancho,' or 'devil,' 'I\ndon't understand thee; and if I don't make my meaning plain, then you may\ncorrect me, for I am so focile-\"\n\n\"I don't understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at once; \"for I know\nnot what 'I am so focile' means.\"\n\n\"'So focile' means I am so much that way,\" replied Sancho.\n\n\"I understand thee still less now,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Well, if you can't understand me,\" said Sancho, \"I don't know how to put\nit; I know no more, God help me.\"\n\n\"Oh, now I have hit it,\" said Don Quixote; \"thou wouldst say thou art so\ndocile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to thee, and\nsubmit to what I teach thee.\"\n\n\"I would bet,\" said Sancho, \"that from the very first you understood me,\nand knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear\nme make another couple of dozen blunders.\"\n\n\"May be so,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but to come to the point, what does\nTeresa say?\"\n\n\"Teresa says,\" replied Sancho, \"that I should make sure with your\nworship, and 'let papers speak and beards be still,' for 'he who binds\ndoes not wrangle,' since one 'take' is better than two 'I'll give\nthee's;' and I say a woman's advice is no great thing, and he who won't\ntake it is a fool.\"\n\n\"And so say I,\" said Don Quixote; \"continue, Sancho my friend; go on; you\ntalk pearls to-day.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" continued Sancho, \"that, as your worship knows better than\nI do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and to-morrow\nwe are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can\npromise himself more hours of life in this world than God may be pleased\nto give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at our life's\ndoor, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor struggles, nor\nsceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk and report say,\nand as they tell us from the pulpits every day.\"\n\n\"All that is very true,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I cannot make out what\nthou art driving at.\"\n\n\"What I am driving at,\" said Sancho, \"is that your worship settle some\nfixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and\nthat the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don't care to stand on\nrewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me with\nmy own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it much or\nlittle; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make a much,\nand so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To be sure, if\nit should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your worship\nwere to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so ungrateful\nnor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenue of such\nisland valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.\"\n\n\"Sancho, my friend,\" replied Don Quixote, \"sometimes proportion may be as\ngood as promotion.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Sancho; \"I'll bet I ought to have said proportion, and not\npromotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.\"\n\n\"And so well understood,\" returned Don Quixote, \"that I have seen into\nthe depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with\nthe countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would readily\nfix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the\nknights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their\nsquires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best\npart of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any\nknight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only know that\nthey all served on reward, and that when they least expected it, if good\nluck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed with an\nisland or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were left with\na title and lordship. If with these hopes and additional inducements you,\nSancho, please to return to my service, well and good; but to suppose\nthat I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of\nknight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to your\nhouse and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes and you\nlike to be on reward with me, bene quidem; if not, we remain friends; for\nif the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and\nbear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and\na good grievance better than a bad compensation. I speak in this way,\nSancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs just as well as\nyourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say, that if you don't\nlike to come on reward with me, and run the same chance that I run, God\nbe with you and make a saint of you; for I shall find plenty of squires\nmore obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded or talkative as you\nare.\"\n\nWhen Sancho heard his master's firm, resolute language, a cloud came over\nthe sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had made sure\nthat his master would not go without him for all the wealth of the world;\nand as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came in\nwith the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what\narguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seek\nadventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he had\ndone before, said with a loud voice, \"O flower of knight-errantry! O\nshining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may God\nAlmighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who\nwould impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the\nlabyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!\"\nAnd then, turning to the housekeeper, he said, \"Mistress housekeeper may\njust as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know\nit is the positive determination of the spheres that Senor Don Quixote\nshall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and I\nshould lay a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade\nthis knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his\nvaliant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he is\ndefrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection of\norphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the\nsupport of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging,\nproper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord\nDon Quixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out\nto-day rather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution\nof your purpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want;\nand were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should\nesteem it the happiest good fortune.\"\n\nAt this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, \"Did I not tell thee,\nSancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who\noffers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson\nCarrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan\nschools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or\nthirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant's\nsquire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should\nshake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and\ncut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new\nSamson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring\nhonour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I\nwill be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not\ndeign to accompany me.\"\n\n\"I do deign,\" said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; \"it\nshall not be said of me, master mine,\" he continued, \"'the bread eaten\nand the company dispersed.' Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all\nthe world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I\nam descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many\ngood words and deeds, your worship's desire to show me favour; and if I\nhave been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please\nmy wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives\nthe hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but, after\nall, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow,\nwhich I can't deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take\nit amiss; and so there's nothing more to do but for your worship to make\nyour will with its codicil in such a way that it can't be provoked, and\nlet us set out at once, to save Senor Samson's soul from suffering, as he\nsays his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out\nupon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship\nfaithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that\nserved knights-errant in times past or present.\"\n\nThe bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho's phraseology\nand style of talk, for though he had read the first part of his master's\nhistory he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there\ndescribed; but now, hearing him talk of a \"will and codicil that could\nnot be provoked,\" instead of \"will and codicil that could not be\nrevoked,\" he believed all he had read of him, and set him down as one of\nthe greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two\nsuch lunatics as master and man the world had never seen. In fine, Don\nQuixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the\nadvice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their\noracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days\nthence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the\njourney ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he\nmust by all means take. Samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of\nhis who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with\nrust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel.\n\nThe curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor\nwere past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in\nthe style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a\nlamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had\nbeen his death. Samson's intention in persuading him to sally forth once\nmore was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of\nthe curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.\nFinally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho provided\nthemselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having\npacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, at\nnightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to\naccompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El\nToboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple,\nhis alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and\nhis purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies.\nSamson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or\nevil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with\nhim over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote\npromised him he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the\nother two took the road for the great city of El Toboso.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS LADY\nDULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\n\n\n\"Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!\" says Hamete Benengeli on beginning\nthis eighth chapter; \"blessed be Allah!\" he repeats three times; and he\nsays he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that he has now got Don\nQuixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers of his delightful\nhistory may reckon that the achievements and humours of Don Quixote and\nhis squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forget the former\nchivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on those that\nare to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as the others\nbegan on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he asks in\nconsideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:\n\nDon Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took his\ndeparture, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by both\nknight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;\nthough, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple were\nlouder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that\nhis good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,\nperhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the\nhistory says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he\nstumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come out, for\nby stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe or\na broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much astray in this.\n\nSaid Don Quixote, \"Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us as we\ngo, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;\nfor there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, and\nthere I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerless\nDulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shall\nconclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; for\nnothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding\nthemselves favoured by their ladies.\"\n\n\"So I believe,\" replied Sancho; \"but I think it will be difficult for\nyour worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate where you will be\nable to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws it over the wall\nof the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took her the letter\nthat told of the follies and mad things your worship was doing in the\nheart of Sierra Morena.\"\n\n\"Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where\nor at which thou sawest that never sufficiently extolled grace and\nbeauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, or portico of some rich\nand royal palace.\"\n\n\"It might have been all that,\" returned Sancho, \"but to me it looked like\na wall, unless I am short of memory.\"\n\n\"At all events, let us go there, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, so that\nI see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at a\nwindow, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; for any\nbeam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my\nreason and strength to my heart, so that I shall be unmatched and\nunequalled in wisdom and valour.\"\n\n\"Well, to tell the truth, senor,\" said Sancho, \"when I saw that sun of\nthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out beams\nat all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting that wheat I\ntold you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud\nand dimmed it.\"\n\n\"What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"in saying,\nthinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady Dulcinea was sifting\nwheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what\nis and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are\nconstituted and reserved for other avocations and pursuits that show\ntheir rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, O Sancho, those lines of\nour poet wherein he paints for us how, in their crystal abodes, those\nfour nymphs employed themselves who rose from their loved Tagus and\nseated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider those tissues which\nthe ingenious poet there describes to us, how they were worked and woven\nwith gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sort must have been\nthe employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only that the spite which\nsome wicked enchanter seems to have against everything of mine changes\nall those things that give me pleasure, and turns them into shapes unlike\ntheir own; and so I fear that in that history of my achievements which\nthey say is now in print, if haply its author was some sage who is an\nenemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another, mingling a\nthousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relating\ntransactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true\nhistory. O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the\nvirtues! All the vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them;\nbut envy brings nothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.\"\n\n\"So I say too,\" replied Sancho; \"and I suspect in that legend or history\nof us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw, my honour goes\ndragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweeping the streets, as\nthey say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I never spoke ill of\nany enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to be envied; to be\nsure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of the rogue in me; but\nall is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity, always natural and\nnever acted; and if I had no other merit save that I believe, as I always\ndo, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy Roman Catholic Church holds\nand believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of the Jews, the historians\nought to have mercy on me and treat me well in their writings. But let\nthem say what they like; naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither\nlose nor gain; nay, while I see myself put into a book and passed on from\nhand to hand over the world, I don't care a fig, let them say what they\nlike of me.\"\n\n\"That, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"reminds me of what happened to a\nfamous poet of our own day, who, having written a bitter satire against\nall the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name in it a certain lady of\nwhom it was questionable whether she was one or not. She, seeing she was\nnot in the list of the poet, asked him what he had seen in her that he\ndid not include her in the number of the others, telling him he must add\nto his satire and put her in the new part, or else look out for the\nconsequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left her without a shred\nof reputation, and she was satisfied by getting fame though it was\ninfamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of that shepherd who set\nfire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of the seven wonders of\nthe world, and burned it with the sole object of making his name live in\nafter ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, or mention his name\nby word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of his ambition should be\nattained, nevertheless it became known that he was called Erostratus. And\nsomething of the same sort is what happened in the case of the great\nemperor Charles V and a gentleman in Rome. The emperor was anxious to see\nthat famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancient times the temple 'of\nall the gods,' but now-a-days, by a better nomenclature, 'of all the\nsaints,' which is the best preserved building of all those of pagan\nconstruction in Rome, and the one which best sustains the reputation of\nmighty works and magnificence of its founders. It is in the form of a\nhalf orange, of enormous dimensions, and well lighted, though no light\npenetrates it save that which is admitted by a window, or rather round\nskylight, at the top; and it was from this that the emperor examined the\nbuilding. A Roman gentleman stood by his side and explained to him the\nskilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabric and its wonderful\narchitecture, and when they had left the skylight he said to the emperor,\n'A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, the impulse came upon me to seize\nyour Majesty in my arms and fling myself down from yonder skylight, so as\nto leave behind me in the world a name that would last for ever.' 'I am\nthankful to you for not carrying such an evil thought into effect,' said\nthe emperor, 'and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again\nputting your loyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to\nspeak to me or to be where I am; and he followed up these words by\nbestowing a liberal bounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the\ndesire of acquiring fame is a very powerful motive. What, thinkest thou,\nwas it that flung Horatius in full armour down from the bridge into the\ndepths of the Tiber? What burned the hand and arm of Mutius? What\nimpelled Curtius to plunge into the deep burning gulf that opened in the\nmidst of Rome? What, in opposition to all the omens that declared against\nhim, made Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern\nexamples, what scuttled the ships, and left stranded and cut off the\ngallant Spaniards under the command of the most courteous Cortes in the\nNew World? All these and a variety of other great exploits are, were and\nwill be, the work of fame that mortals desire as a reward and a portion\nof the immortality their famous deeds deserve; though we Catholic\nChristians and knights-errant look more to that future glory that is\neverlasting in the ethereal regions of heaven than to the vanity of the\nfame that is to be acquired in this present transitory life; a fame that,\nhowever long it may last, must after all end with the world itself, which\nhas its own appointed end. So that, O Sancho, in what we do we must not\noverpass the bounds which the Christian religion we profess has assigned\nto us. We have to slay pride in giants, envy by generosity and nobleness\nof heart, anger by calmness of demeanour and equanimity, gluttony and\nsloth by the spareness of our diet and the length of our vigils, lust and\nlewdness by the loyalty we preserve to those whom we have made the\nmistresses of our thoughts, indolence by traversing the world in all\ndirections seeking opportunities of making ourselves, besides Christians,\nfamous knights. Such, Sancho, are the means by which we reach those\nextremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.\"\n\n\"All that your worship has said so far,\" said Sancho, \"I have understood\nquite well; but still I would be glad if your worship would dissolve a\ndoubt for me, which has just this minute come into my mind.\"\n\n\"Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"say on, in God's name,\nand I will answer as well as I can.\"\n\n\"Tell me, senor,\" Sancho went on to say, \"those Julys or Augusts, and all\nthose venturous knights that you say are now dead--where are they now?\"\n\n\"The heathens,\" replied Don Quixote, \"are, no doubt, in hell; the\nChristians, if they were good Christians, are either in purgatory or in\nheaven.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Sancho; \"but now I want to know--the tombs where the\nbodies of those great lords are, have they silver lamps before them, or\nare the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches, winding-sheets,\ntresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are they ornamented with?\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote made answer: \"The tombs of the heathens were\ngenerally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Caesar's body were\nplaced on the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in\nRome Saint Peter's needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as\nlarge as a good-sized village, which they called the Moles Adriani, and\nis now the castle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen Artemisia buried her\nhusband Mausolus in a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of\nthe world; but none of these tombs, or of the many others of the\nheathens, were ornamented with winding-sheets or any of those other\nofferings and tokens that show that they who are buried there are\nsaints.\"\n\n\"That's the point I'm coming to,\" said Sancho; \"and now tell me, which is\nthe greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?\"\n\n\"The answer is easy,\" replied Don Quixote; \"it is a greater work to bring\nto life a dead man.\"\n\n\"Now I have got you,\" said Sancho; \"in that case the fame of them who\nbring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, cure cripples,\nrestore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there are lamps\nburning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on their knees\nadoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the other than\nthat which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have ever\nbeen in the world have left or may leave behind them?\"\n\n\"That I grant, too,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever you call\nit,\" said Sancho, \"belong to the bodies and relics of the saints who,\nwith the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church, have\nlamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, by\nmeans of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christian\nreputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their\nshoulders, and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their\noratories and favourite altars with them.\"\n\n\"What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?\" asked\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"My meaning is,\" said Sancho, \"let us set about becoming saints, and we\nshall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are striving after; for you\nknow, senor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for it is so lately\none may say so) they canonised and beatified two little barefoot friars,\nand it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss or touch the iron\nchains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, and they are held\nin greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword of Roland in the\narmoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that, senor, it is\nbetter to be an humble little friar of no matter what order, than a\nvaliant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance lashings are\nof more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given to giants,\nor monsters, or dragons.\"\n\n\"All that is true,\" returned Don Quixote, \"but we cannot all be friars,\nand many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry is a\nreligion, there are sainted knights in glory.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sancho, \"but I have heard say that there are more friars in\nheaven than knights-errant.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"is because those in religious orders are more\nnumerous than knights.\"\n\n\"The errants are many,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Many,\" replied Don Quixote, \"but few they who deserve the name of\nknights.\"\n\nWith these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that\nnight and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to\nthem, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the\nnext day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the\nsight of which Don Quixote's spirits rose and Sancho's fell, for he did\nnot know Dulcinea's house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any\nmore than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her,\nthe other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what\nhe was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don\nQuixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited\nuntil the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and\nwhen the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance\ninto the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called\nsomething.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THERE\n\n\n'Twas at the very midnight hour--more or less--when Don Quixote and\nSancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep\nsilence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad\nof their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho\nwould have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the\ndarkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to\nbe heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don\nQuixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed,\npigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder\nin the silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of\nevil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, \"Sancho, my son, lead on to\nthe palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.\"\n\n\"Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,\" said Sancho, \"when what I\nsaw her highness in was only a very little house?\"\n\n\"Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her\npalace,\" said Don Quixote, \"to amuse herself with damsels, as great\nladies and princesses are accustomed to do.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"if your worship will have it in spite of me that\nthe house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to\nfind the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they\nhear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through\nthe household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches,\nlike gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it\nmay be?\"\n\n\"Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,\" replied Don\nQuixote, \"and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but\nlook, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees\nfrom here should be Dulcinea's palace.\"\n\n\"Then let your worship lead the way,\" said Sancho, \"perhaps it may be so;\nthough I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I'll believe it\nas much as I believe it is daylight now.\"\n\nDon Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces\nhe came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great\ntower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace,\nbut the chief church of the town, and said he, \"It's the church we have\nlit upon, Sancho.\"\n\n\"So I see,\" said Sancho, \"and God grant we may not light upon our graves;\nit is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time\nof night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don't mistake,\nthat the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.\"\n\n\"The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!\" said Don Quixote; \"where hast\nthou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys\nwithout an outlet?\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"every country has a way of its own; perhaps\nhere in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in\nalleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these\nstreets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I may\nstumble on this palace--and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for leading\nus such a dance.\"\n\n\"Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after\nthe bucket.\"\n\n\"I'll hold my tongue,\" said Sancho, \"but how am I to take it patiently\nwhen your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our\nmistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when\nyour worship can't find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?\"\n\n\"Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"Look\nhere, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I have never\nonce in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the threshold of\nher palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great\nreputation she bears for beauty and discretion?\"\n\n\"I hear it now,\" returned Sancho; \"and I may tell you that if you have\nnot seen her, no more have I.\"\n\n\"That cannot be,\" said Don Quixote, \"for, at any rate, thou saidst, on\nbringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee, that thou sawest\nher sifting wheat.\"\n\n\"Don't mind that, senor,\" said Sancho; \"I must tell you that my seeing\nher and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too, for I can no\nmore tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can hit the sky.\"\n\n\"Sancho, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"there are times for jests and times\nwhen jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have neither seen nor\nspoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou shouldst say\nthou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary is the case,\nas thou well knowest.\"\n\nWhile the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived some one\nwith a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the\nnoise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him\nto be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and\nso it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that says--\n\nIll did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase--\n\n\"May I die, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, when he heard him, \"if any good\nwill come to us tonight! Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Sancho, \"but what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we\nhave in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos,\nfor any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\"\n\nBy this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \"Can\nyou tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the\npalace of the peerless princess Dona Dulcinea del Toboso?\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied the lad, \"I am a stranger, and I have been only a few\ndays in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house\nopposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both\nor either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this\nlady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso;\nthough it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it;\nmany ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may\nbe a princess.\"\n\n\"Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\"\nsaid Don Quixote.\n\n\"May be so,\" replied the lad; \"God be with you, for here comes the\ndaylight;\" and without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped\non his mules.\n\nSancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to\nhim, \"Senor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us\nto let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit\nthe city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the\nneighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won't leave a\nnook or corner of the whole village that I won't search for the house,\ncastle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don't\nfind it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, and\ntell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some\nplan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.\"\n\n\"Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast delivered a thousand sentences\ncondensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advice thou\nhast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us go look for\nsome place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to\nseek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy I look\nfor favours more than miraculous.\"\n\nSancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should\ndiscover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra\nMorena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they\ntook at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or\nthicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to\nthe city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which\ndemand fresh attention and a new chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE CRAFTY DEVICE SANCHO ADOPTED TO ENCHANT THE LADY\nDULCINEA, AND OTHER INCIDENTS AS LUDICROUS AS THEY ARE TRUE\n\n\nWhen the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down in\nthis chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in silence,\nfearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote's madness\nreaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and even goes\na couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all, though still\nunder the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding\nto the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirely\ndisregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him;\nand he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, and\nalways rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with\nhis story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in\nthe forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he bade Sancho return to\nthe city, and not come into his presence again without having first\nspoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her\ngood pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and\ndeign to bestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for\na happy issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises. Sancho\nundertook to execute the task according to the instructions, and to bring\nback an answer as good as the one he brought back before.\n\n\"Go, my son,\" said Don Quixote, \"and be not dazed when thou findest\nthyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou art going to\nseek. Happy thou, above all the squires in the world! Bear in mind, and\nlet it not escape thy memory, how she receives thee; if she changes\ncolour while thou art giving her my message; if she is agitated and\ndisturbed at hearing my name; if she cannot rest upon her cushion,\nshouldst thou haply find her seated in the sumptuous state chamber proper\nto her rank; and should she be standing, observe if she poises herself\nnow on one foot, now on the other; if she repeats two or three times the\nreply she gives thee; if she passes from gentleness to austerity, from\nasperity to tenderness; if she raises her hand to smooth her hair though\nit be not disarranged. In short, my son, observe all her actions and\nmotions, for if thou wilt report them to me as they were, I will gather\nwhat she hides in the recesses of her heart as regards my love; for I\nwould have thee know, Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with lovers\nthe outward actions and motions they give way to when their loves are in\nquestion are the faithful messengers that carry the news of what is going\non in the depths of their hearts. Go, my friend, may better fortune than\nmine attend thee, and bring thee a happier issue than that which I await\nin dread in this dreary solitude.\"\n\n\"I will go and return quickly,\" said Sancho; \"cheer up that little heart\nof yours, master mine, for at the present moment you seem to have got one\nno bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say, that a stout heart\nbreaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletches there are no pegs;\nand moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it's not looked for. I say\nthis because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to-night,\nnow that it is daylight I count upon finding them when I least expect it,\nand once found, leave it to me to manage her.\"\n\n\"Verily, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou dost always bring in thy\nproverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give me better luck in\nwhat I am anxious about.\"\n\nWith this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don\nQuixote remained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups and\nleaning on the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled\nforebodings; and there we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, who went\noff no less serious and troubled than he left his master; so much so,\nthat as soon as he had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that\nDon Quixote was not within sight, he dismounted from his ass, and seating\nhimself at the foot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying,\n\"Now, brother Sancho, let us know where your worship is going. Are you\ngoing to look for some ass that has been lost? Not at all. Then what are\nyou going to look for? I am going to look for a princess, that's all; and\nin her for the sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once. And where do\nyou expect to find all this, Sancho? Where? Why, in the great city of El\nToboso. Well, and for whom are you going to look for her? For the famous\nknight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those\nwho thirst and drink to the hungry. That's all very well, but do you know\nher house, Sancho? My master says it will be some royal palace or grand\ncastle. And have you ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my master\never saw her. And does it strike you that it would be just and right if\nthe El Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention\nof going to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were\nto come and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They\nwould, indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under\norders, and that 'you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to\nyou.' Don't you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are as\nhot-tempered as they are honest, and won't put up with liberties from\nanybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse for you,\nI promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why should I go\nlooking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and what is more,\nwhen looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in Ravena, or the\nbachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody else, has mixed me\nup in this business!\"\n\nSuch was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion\nhe could come to was to say to himself again, \"Well, there's remedy for\neverything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass, whether we\nlike it or not, when life's finished. I have seen by a thousand signs\nthat this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, and for that matter,\nI too, am not behind him; for I'm a greater fool than he is when I follow\nhim and serve him, if there's any truth in the proverb that says, 'Tell\nme what company thou keepest, and I'll tell thee what thou art,' or in\nthat other, 'Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.'\nWell then, if he be mad, as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes\none thing for another, and white for black, and black for white, as was\nseen when he said the windmills were giants, and the monks' mules\ndromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same\ntune, it will not be very hard to make him believe that some country\ngirl, the first I come across here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does\nnot believe it, I'll swear it; and if he should swear, I'll swear again;\nand if he persists I'll persist still more, so as, come what may, to have\nmy quoit always over the peg. Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may\nput a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time; or\nmaybe he will think, as I suspect he will, that one of those wicked\nenchanters, who he says have a spite against him, has changed her form\nfor the sake of doing him an ill turn and injuring him.\"\n\nWith this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business as\ngood as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don\nQuixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and\nthings turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple,\nhe spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three\npeasant girls on three colts, or fillies--for the author does not make\nthe point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual\nmount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need\nnot stop to prove it.\n\nTo be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full\nspeed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand\npassionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, \"What\nnews, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a\nblack?\"\n\n\"Your worship,\" replied Sancho, \"had better mark it with ruddle, like the\ninscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see\nit plain.\"\n\n\"Then thou bringest good news,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"So good,\" replied Sancho, \"that your worship has only to spur Rocinante\nand get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, who,\nwith two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship.\"\n\n\"Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?\" exclaimed Don\nQuixote. \"Take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joy to\ncheer my real sadness.\"\n\n\"What could I get by deceiving your worship,\" returned Sancho,\n\"especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truth or\nnot? Come, senor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress\ncoming, robed and adorned--in fact, like what she is. Her damsels and she\nare all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, all\nrubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hair\nloose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; and\nmoreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sight\never you saw.\"\n\n\"Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,\" said\nSancho; \"but no matter what they come on, there they are, the finest\nladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princess Dulcinea, who\nstaggers one's senses.\"\n\n\"Let us go, Sancho, my son,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in guerdon of this\nnews, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee the best spoil I\nshall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that does not satisfy\nthee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from my three mares\nthat thou knowest are in foal on our village common.\"\n\n\"I'll take the foals,\" said Sancho; \"for it is not quite certain that the\nspoils of the first adventure will be good ones.\"\n\nBy this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village lasses\nclose at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to El Toboso, and as\nhe could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he was completely\npuzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he had left them.\n\n\"How outside the city?\" returned Sancho. \"Are your worship's eyes in the\nback of your head, that you can't see that they are these who are coming\nhere, shining like the very sun at noonday?\"\n\n\"I see nothing, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but three country girls on\nthree jackasses.\"\n\n\"Now, may God deliver me from the devil!\" said Sancho, \"and can it be\nthat your worship takes three hackneys--or whatever they're called-as\nwhite as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, I could tear my\nbeard if that was the case!\"\n\n\"Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"that it is\nas plain they are jackasses--or jennyasses--as that I am Don Quixote, and\nthou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to me to be so.\"\n\n\"Hush, senor,\" said Sancho, \"don't talk that way, but open your eyes, and\ncome and pay your respects to the lady of your thoughts, who is close\nupon us now;\" and with these words he advanced to receive the three\nvillage lasses, and dismounting from Dapple, caught hold of one of the\nasses of the three country girls by the halter, and dropping on both\nknees on the ground, he said, \"Queen and princess and duchess of beauty,\nmay it please your haughtiness and greatness to receive into your favour\nand good-will your captive knight who stands there turned into marble\nstone, and quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself in your\nmagnificent presence. I am Sancho Panza, his squire, and he the vagabond\nknight Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called 'The Knight of the\nRueful Countenance.'\"\n\nDon Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,\nand, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regarding\nher whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in her\nexcept a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she was\nplatter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did\nnot venture to open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, were\nastonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on their\nknees, preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who had\nbeen stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, \"Get out of the\nway, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry.\"\n\nTo which Sancho returned, \"Oh, princess and universal lady of El Toboso,\nis not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar and prop of\nknight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?\"\n\nOn hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, \"Woa then! why, I'm rubbing\nthee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings come to\nmake game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff as well\nas themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will be better\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Get up, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at this; \"I see that fortune, 'with\nevil done to me unsated still,' has taken possession of all the roads by\nwhich any comfort may reach 'this wretched soul' that I carry in my\nflesh. And thou, highest perfection of excellence that can be desired,\nutmost limit of grace in human shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart\nthat adores thee, though the malign enchanter that persecutes me has\nbrought clouds and cataracts on my eyes, and to them, and them only,\ntransformed thy unparagoned beauty and changed thy features into those of\na poor peasant girl, if so be he has not at the same time changed mine\ninto those of some monster to render them loathsome in thy sight, refuse\nnot to look upon me with tenderness and love; seeing in this submission\nthat I make on my knees to thy transformed beauty the humility with which\nmy soul adores thee.\"\n\n\"Hey-day! My grandfather!\" cried the girl, \"much I care for your\nlove-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we'll thank you.\"\n\nSancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so well\nout of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who had done\nduty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her \"cackney\" with a spike\nshe had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speed across the\nfield. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutely than usual,\nbegan cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea to the ground;\nseeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho to fix and\ngirth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass's belly. The\npack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift up his\nenchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,\ngetting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back a\nlittle, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of the\nass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and sat\nastride like a man, whereat Sancho said, \"Rogue! but our lady is lighter\nthan a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or Mexican how to\nmount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and without spurs\nshe is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her damsels are no way\nbehind her, for they all fly like the wind;\" which was the truth, for as\nsoon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her, and sped\naway without looking back, for more than half a league.\n\nDon Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer in\nsight, he turned to Sancho and said, \"How now, Sancho? thou seest how I\nam hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice and spite\nthey bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness it would\ngive me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I was born to\nbe an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which the arrows\nof adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho, that these\ntraitors were not content with changing and transforming my Dulcinea, but\nthey transformed and changed her into a shape as mean and ill-favoured as\nthat of the village girl yonder; and at the same time they robbed her of\nthat which is such a peculiar property of ladies of distinction, that is\nto say, the sweet fragrance that comes of being always among perfumes and\nflowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that when I approached to put\nDulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it was, though to me it\nappeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw garlic that made my head\nreel, and poisoned my very heart.\"\n\n\"O scum of the earth!\" cried Sancho at this, \"O miserable, spiteful\nenchanters! O that I could see you all strung by the gills, like sardines\non a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a great deal, and ye do a\ngreat deal more. It ought to have been enough for you, ye scoundrels, to\nhave changed the pearls of my lady's eyes into oak galls, and her hair of\npurest gold into the bristles of a red ox's tail, and in short, all her\nfeatures from fair to foul, without meddling with her smell; for by that\nwe might somehow have found out what was hidden underneath that ugly\nrind; though, to tell the truth, I never perceived her ugliness, but only\nher beauty, which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole\nshe had on her right lip, like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs\nlike threads of gold, and more than a palm long.\"\n\n\"From the correspondence which exists between those of the face and those\nof the body,\" said Don Quixote, \"Dulcinea must have another mole\nresembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side on which she has\nthe one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hast mentioned are very\nlong for moles.\"\n\n\"Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,\" replied\nSancho.\n\n\"I believe it, my friend,\" returned Don Quixote; \"for nature bestowed\nnothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect and well-finished; and so, if\nshe had a hundred moles like the one thou hast described, in her they\nwould not be moles, but moons and shining stars. But tell me, Sancho,\nthat which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thou wert fixing it, was\nit a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?\"\n\n\"It was neither,\" replied Sancho, \"but a jineta saddle, with a field\ncovering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.\"\n\n\"And that I could not see all this, Sancho!\" said Don Quixote; \"once more\nI say, and will say a thousand times, I am the most unfortunate of men.\"\n\nSancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing the\nsimplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length, after a\ngood deal more conversation had passed between them, they remounted their\nbeasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which they expected to reach\nin time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every year\nin that illustrious city; but before they got there things happened to\nthem, so many, so important, and so strange, that they deserve to be\nrecorded and read, as will be seen farther on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nOF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAR\nOR CART OF \"THE CORTES OF DEATH\"\n\n\nDejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning over\nin his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his\nlady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think\nof any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections\nso absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go Rocinante's\nbridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at\nevery step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.\n\nSancho recalled him from his reverie. \"Melancholy, senor,\" said he, \"was\nmade, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it overmuch\nthey turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be yourself again;\ngather up Rocinante's reins; cheer up, rouse yourself and show that\ngallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. What the devil is this?\nWhat weakness is this? Are we here or in France? The devil fly away with\nall the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being of a single\nknight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and\ntransformations on earth.\"\n\n\"Hush, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice, \"hush and\nutter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I alone am to blame\nfor her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of the hatred the\nwicked bear me.\"\n\n\"So say I,\" returned Sancho; \"his heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw\nher once, to see her now.\"\n\n\"Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"as thou sawest\nher in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantment does not go\nso far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee; against\nme alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed.\nNevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred to me, and that is\nthat thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as well as I\nrecollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes that are like\npearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and I am\npersuaded that Dulcinea's must be green emeralds, full and soft, with two\nrainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes and transfer\nthem to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast taken the one\nfor the other, the eyes for the teeth.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Sancho; \"for her beauty bewildered me as much as her\nugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all to God, who alone\nknows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil world of\nours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture of\nwickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, senor, troubles me\nmore than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your\nworship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go\nand present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this\npoor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I\nthink I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies,\nand asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle\nof the street they won't know her any more than they would my father.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"the enchantment does not go so\nfar as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power\nof recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the\nfirst I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by\ncommanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them\nin this respect.\"\n\n\"I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\" said\nSancho; \"and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know;\nand if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the\nmisfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea\nis well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as\nwell as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own\ncourse; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\"\n\nDon Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a\ncart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages\nand figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as\ncarter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt\nor cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote's\neyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel\nwith large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to\nall appearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god\ncalled Cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows;\nthere was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or\nhelmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along\nwith these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces. All\nthis, unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and\nstruck terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote\nwas glad of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting\nitself to him, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to\nface any danger, he planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud\nand menacing tone, exclaimed, \"Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever\nthou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who\nthese folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon's\nboat than an ordinary cart.\"\n\nTo which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, \"Senor, we are\nplayers of Angulo el Malo's company; we have been acting the play of 'The\nCortes of Death' this morning, which is the octave of Corpus Christi, in\na village behind that hill, and we have to act it this afternoon in that\nvillage which you can see from this; and as it is so near, and to save\nthe trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go in the costumes in\nwhich we perform. That lad there appears as Death, that other as an\nangel, that woman, the manager's wife, plays the queen, this one the\nsoldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I am one of the principal\ncharacters of the play, for in this company I take the leading parts. If\nyou want to know anything more about us, ask me and I will answer with\nthe utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up to everything.\"\n\n\"By the faith of a knight-errant,\" replied Don Quixote, \"when I saw this\ncart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me; but I\ndeclare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if\nillusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep your\nfestival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can render\nyou a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child I was\nfond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor's art.\"\n\nWhile they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a\nmummers' dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown\nox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew\napproaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the\nground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the\nbells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite of\nDon Quixote's efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he\nset off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy\never gave any promise of.\n\nSancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off\nDapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him\nhe was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante, who had come\ndown with his master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante's vivacity\nand high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted his beast to go and help\nDon Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on Dapple, and\nbeating him with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain\nof the blows, made him fly across the fields towards the village where\nthey were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessed Dapple's career\nand his master's fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need he\nshould attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good\nservant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for\nhis ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come\ndown on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of\ndeath, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his\nown eyes than on the least hair of his ass's tail. In this trouble and\nperplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than\nhe liked, and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him,\n\"Senor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.\"\n\n\"What devil?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"The one with the bladders,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Then I will recover him,\" said Don Quixote, \"even if he be shut up with\nhim in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me, Sancho, for\nthe cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make good the loss\nof Dapple.\"\n\n\"You need not take the trouble, senor,\" said Sancho; \"keep cool, for as I\nnow see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his old\nquarters;\" and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, in\nimitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the\ntown, and the ass came back to his master.\n\n\"For all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"it will be well to visit the\ndiscourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it were\nthe emperor himself.\"\n\n\"Don't think of it, your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"take my advice and\nnever meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have\nknown an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;\nremember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours\nand protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they\nare those of the royal companies and under patent, all or most of whom in\ndress and appearance look like princes.\"\n\n\"Still, for all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"the player devil must not go\noff boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.\"\n\nSo saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,\nshouting out as he went, \"Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to\nteach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of\nknights-errant for steeds.\"\n\nSo loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and\nunderstood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker's intention\nwas, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the\ndevil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god Cupid\nstay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line,\nprepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles. Don\nQuixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted\narms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began\nto consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to\nhimself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack\nthis well-ordered squadron, said to him, \"It would be the height of\nmadness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops\nfrom the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the\nworld, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one\nshould remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to\nattack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person,\nwith angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not\nmake you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all\nthese, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a\nsingle knight-errant.\"\n\n\"Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"which\nmay and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. I cannot\nand must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee, against\nanyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, if thou wilt,\nto take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and I will help thee\nfrom here by shouts and salutary counsels.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, senor,\" replied\nSancho; \"for it is not the part of good Christians to revenge wrongs; and\nbesides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his grievance to my\ngood-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven\ngrants me life.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Don Quixote, \"if that be thy determination, good Sancho,\nsensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave these\nphantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier adventures;\nfor, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to find plenty of\nmarvellous ones in it.\"\n\nHe at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple,\nDeath and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their\njourney, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended happily,\nthanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, the following day,\na fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than the last, with an\nenamoured knight-errant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nOF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THE\nBOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS\n\n\nThe night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote and\nhis squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at\nSancho's persuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and\nover their supper Sancho said to his master, \"Senor, what a fool I should\nhave looked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first\nadventure your worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares.\nAfter all, 'a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing.'\"\n\n\"At the same time, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"if thou hadst let me\nattack them as I wanted, at the very least the emperor's gold crown and\nCupid's painted wings would have fallen to thee as spoils, for I should\nhave taken them by force and given them into thy hands.\"\n\n\"The sceptres and crowns of those play-actor emperors,\" said Sancho,\n\"were never yet pure gold, but only brass foil or tin.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"for it would not be right that the\naccessories of the drama should be real, instead of being mere fictions\nand semblances, like the drama itself; towards which, Sancho-and, as a\nnecessary consequence, towards those who represent and produce it--I\nwould that thou wert favourably disposed, for they are all instruments of\ngreat good to the State, placing before us at every step a mirror in\nwhich we may see vividly displayed what goes on in human life; nor is\nthere any similitude that shows us more faithfully what we are and ought\nto be than the play and the players. Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a\nplay acted in which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and\ndivers other personages were introduced? One plays the villain, another\nthe knave, this one the merchant, that the soldier, one the sharp-witted\nfool, another the foolish lover; and when the play is over, and they have\nput off the dresses they wore in it, all the actors become equal.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have seen that,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Well then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the same thing happens in the comedy and\nlife of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in\nshort, all the characters that can be brought into a play; but when it is\nover, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the\ngarments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the\ngrave.\"\n\n\"A fine comparison!\" said Sancho; \"though not so new but that I have\nheard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of\nchess; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own particular\noffice, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and\nshaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much like ending\nlife in the grave.\"\n\n\"Thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, Sancho,\" said\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Sancho; \"it must be that some of your worship's shrewdness\nsticks to me; land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to yield\ngood fruit if you dung it and till it; what I mean is that your worship's\nconversation has been the dung that has fallen on the barren soil of my\ndry wit, and the time I have been in your service and society has been\nthe tillage; and with the help of this I hope to yield fruit in abundance\nthat will not fall away or slide from those paths of good breeding that\nyour worship has made in my parched understanding.\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho's affected phraseology, and perceived that\nwhat he said about his improvement was true, for now and then he spoke in\na way that surprised him; though always, or mostly, when Sancho tried to\ntalk fine and attempted polite language, he wound up by toppling over\nfrom the summit of his simplicity into the abyss of his ignorance; and\nwhere he showed his culture and his memory to the greatest advantage was\nin dragging in proverbs, no matter whether they had any bearing or not\nupon the subject in hand, as may have been seen already and will be\nnoticed in the course of this history.\n\nIn conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but\nSancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to\nsay when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him at\nliberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante's saddle, as his\nmaster's express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or\nnot sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped--the ancient\nusage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the\nbridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the\nhorse--never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same liberty he\nhad given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a friendship so\nunequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by tradition from father\nto son, that the author of this veracious history devoted some special\nchapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due\nto a history so heroic, he did not insert therein; although at times he\nforgets this resolution of his and describes how eagerly the two beasts\nwould scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were\ntired or full, Rocinante would lay his neck across Dapple's, stretching\nhalf a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus,\ngazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as\nthey were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for\nfood. I may add that they say the author left it on record that he\nlikened their friendship to that of Nisus and Euryalus, and Pylades and\nOrestes; and if that be so, it may be perceived, to the admiration of\nmankind, how firm the friendship must have been between these two\npeaceful animals, shaming men, who preserve friendships with one another\nso badly. This was why it was said--\n\nFor friend no longer is there friend;\nThe reeds turn lances now.\n\nAnd some one else has sung--\n\nFriend to friend the bug, etc.\n\nAnd let no one fancy that the author was at all astray when he compared\nthe friendship of these animals to that of men; for men have received\nmany lessons from beasts, and learned many important things, as, for\nexample, the clyster from the stork, vomit and gratitude from the dog,\nwatchfulness from the crane, foresight from the ant, modesty from the\nelephant, and loyalty from the horse.\n\nSancho at last fell asleep at the foot of a cork tree, while Don Quixote\ndozed at that of a sturdy oak; but a short time only had elapsed when a\nnoise he heard behind him awoke him, and rising up startled, he listened\nand looked in the direction the noise came from, and perceived two men on\nhorseback, one of whom, letting himself drop from the saddle, said to the\nother, \"Dismount, my friend, and take the bridles off the horses, for, so\nfar as I can see, this place will furnish grass for them, and the\nsolitude and silence my love-sick thoughts need of.\" As he said this he\nstretched himself upon the ground, and as he flung himself down, the\narmour in which he was clad rattled, whereby Don Quixote perceived that\nhe must be a knight-errant; and going over to Sancho, who was asleep, he\nshook him by the arm and with no small difficulty brought him back to his\nsenses, and said in a low voice to him, \"Brother Sancho, we have got an\nadventure.\"\n\n\"God send us a good one,\" said Sancho; \"and where may her ladyship the\nadventure be?\"\n\n\"Where, Sancho?\" replied Don Quixote; \"turn thine eyes and look, and thou\nwilt see stretched there a knight-errant, who, it strikes me, is not over\nand above happy, for I saw him fling himself off his horse and throw\nhimself on the ground with a certain air of dejection, and his armour\nrattled as he fell.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sancho, \"how does your worship make out that to be an\nadventure?\"\n\n\"I do not mean to say,\" returned Don Quixote, \"that it is a complete\nadventure, but that it is the beginning of one, for it is in this way\nadventures begin. But listen, for it seems he is tuning a lute or guitar,\nand from the way he is spitting and clearing his chest he must be getting\nready to sing something.\"\n\n\"Faith, you are right,\" said Sancho, \"and no doubt he is some enamoured\nknight.\"\n\n\"There is no knight-errant that is not,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let us\nlisten to him, for, if he sings, by that thread we shall extract the ball\nof his thoughts; because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth\nspeaketh.\"\n\nSancho was about to reply to his master, but the Knight of the Grove's\nvoice, which was neither very bad nor very good, stopped him, and\nlistening attentively the pair heard him sing this\n\nSONNET\n\nYour pleasure, prithee, lady mine, unfold;\n  Declare the terms that I am to obey;\nMy will to yours submissively I mould,\n  And from your law my feet shall never stray.\n  Would you I die, to silent grief a prey?\nThen count me even now as dead and cold;\n  Would you I tell my woes in some new way?\nThen shall my tale by Love itself be told.\nThe unison of opposites to prove,\n  Of the soft wax and diamond hard am I;\nBut still, obedient to the laws of love,\n  Here, hard or soft, I offer you my breast,\n  Whate'er you grave or stamp thereon shall rest\n    Indelible for all eternity.\n\nWith an \"Ah me!\" that seemed to be drawn from the inmost recesses of his\nheart, the Knight of the Grove brought his lay to an end, and shortly\nafterwards exclaimed in a melancholy and piteous voice, \"O fairest and\nmost ungrateful woman on earth! What! can it be, most serene Casildea de\nVandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive knight to waste away and\nperish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous toils? It is not\nenough that I have compelled all the knights of Navarre, all the Leonese,\nall the Tartesians, all the Castilians, and finally all the knights of La\nMancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"for I am of La Mancha, and I have\nnever confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confess a\nthing so much to the prejudice of my lady's beauty; thou seest how this\nknight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tell us more\nabout himself.\"\n\n\"That he will,\" returned Sancho, \"for he seems in a mood to bewail\nhimself for a month at a stretch.\"\n\nBut this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices\nnear him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed\nin a distinct but courteous tone, \"Who goes there? What are you? Do you\nbelong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?\"\n\n\"Of the miserable,\" answered Don Quixote.\n\n\"Then come to me,\" said he of the Grove, \"and rest assured that it is to\nwoe itself and affliction itself you come.\"\n\nDon Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous\nmanner, went over to him, and so did Sancho.\n\nThe doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, \"Sit down here,\nsir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess\nknight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this\nplace, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of\nknights-errant, keep you company.\" To which Don made answer, \"A knight I\nam of the profession you mention, and though sorrows, misfortunes, and\ncalamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion I feel for the\nmisfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from it. From what\nyou have just now sung I gather that yours spring from love, I mean from\nthe love you bear that fair ingrate you named in your lament.\"\n\nIn the meantime, they had seated themselves together on the hard ground\npeaceably and sociably, just as if, as soon as day broke, they were not\ngoing to break one another's heads.\n\n\"Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?\" asked he of the Grove of Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"By mischance I am,\" replied Don Quixote; \"though the ills arising from\nwell-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than\nmisfortunes.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" returned he of the Grove, \"if scorn did not unsettle our\nreason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge.\"\n\n\"I was never scorned by my lady,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Sancho, who stood close by, \"for my lady is as a\nlamb, and softer than a roll of butter.\"\n\n\"Is this your squire?\" asked he of the Grove.\n\n\"He is,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I never yet saw a squire,\" said he of the Grove, \"who ventured to speak\nwhen his master was speaking; at least, there is mine, who is as big as\nhis father, and it cannot be proved that he has ever opened his lips when\nI am speaking.\"\n\n\"By my faith then,\" said Sancho, \"I have spoken, and am fit to speak, in\nthe presence of one as much, or even--but never mind--it only makes it\nworse to stir it.\"\n\nThe squire of the Grove took Sancho by the arm, saying to him, \"Let us\ntwo go where we can talk in squire style as much as we please, and leave\nthese gentlemen our masters to fight it out over the story of their\nloves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find them at it without having\nmade an end of it.\"\n\n\"So be it by all means,\" said Sancho; \"and I will tell your worship who I\nam, that you may see whether I am to be reckoned among the number of the\nmost talkative squires.\"\n\nWith this the two squires withdrew to one side, and between them there\npassed a conversation as droll as that which passed between their masters\nwas serious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nIN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE, TOGETHER\nWITH THE SENSIBLE, ORIGINAL, AND TRANQUIL COLLOQUY THAT PASSED BETWEEN\nTHE TWO SQUIRES\n\n\nThe knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story of\ntheir lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history relates\nfirst of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards takes up\nthat of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little from the\nothers, he of the Grove said to Sancho, \"A hard life it is we lead and\nlive, senor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we eat our\nbread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God laid on\nour first parents.\"\n\n\"It may be said, too,\" added Sancho, \"that we eat it in the chill of our\nbodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squires of\nknight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something to\neat, for woes are lighter if there's bread; but sometimes we go a day or\ntwo without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.\"\n\n\"All that,\" said he of the Grove, \"may be endured and put up with when we\nhave hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves is\nexcessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find\nhimself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair\ncounty.\"\n\n\"I,\" said Sancho, \"have already told my master that I shall be content\nwith the government of some island, and he is so noble and generous that\nhe has promised it to me ever so many times.\"\n\n\"I,\" said he of the Grove, \"shall be satisfied with a canonry for my\nservices, and my master has already assigned me one.\"\n\n\"Your master,\" said Sancho, \"no doubt is a knight in the Church line, and\ncan bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine is only a\nlayman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind, designing people,\nstrove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop. He, however,\nwould not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all the time\nlest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding myself fit\nto hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man, I am no\nbetter than a beast for the Church.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you are wrong there,\" said he of the Grove; \"for those\nisland governments are not all satisfactory; some are awkward, some are\npoor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and choicest brings with\nit a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to whose\nlot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it be for us\nwho have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own houses, and\nthere employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations--in hunting or fishing,\nfor instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor as not to\nhave a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself\nwith in his own village?\"\n\n\"I am not in want of any of those things,\" said Sancho; \"to be sure I\nhave no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my master's horse twice\nover; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if I\nwould swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You will laugh\nat the value I put on my Dapple--for dapple is the colour of my beast. As\nto greyhounds, I can't want for them, for there are enough and to spare\nin my town; and, moreover, there is more pleasure in sport when it is at\nother people's expense.\"\n\n\"In truth and earnest, sir squire,\" said he of the Grove, \"I have made up\nmy mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of these\nknights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children; for I have\nthree, like three Oriental pearls.\"\n\n\"I have two,\" said Sancho, \"that might be presented before the Pope\nhimself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, please\nGod, though in spite of her mother.\"\n\n\"And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?\" asked he\nof the Grove.\n\n\"Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,\" answered Sancho; \"but she is\nas tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning, and as strong as a\nporter.\"\n\n\"Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of the\ngreenwood,\" said he of the Grove; \"whoreson strumpet! what pith the rogue\nmust have!\"\n\nTo which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, \"She's no strumpet, nor\nwas her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live;\nspeak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who are\ncourtesy itself, your words don't seem to me to be very becoming.\"\n\n\"O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,\" returned he of the\nGrove. \"What! don't you know that when a horseman delivers a good lance\nthrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything very well,\nthe people are wont to say, 'Ha, whoreson rip! how well he has done it!'\nand that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high praise? Disown\nsons and daughters, senor, who don't do what deserves that compliments of\nthis sort should be paid to their parents.\"\n\n\"I do disown them,\" replied Sancho, \"and in this way, and by the same\nreasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all the\nstrumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that in the\nhighest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I pray God\nto deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same thing, to\ndeliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I have fallen\na second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundred ducats that\nI found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena; and the devil is\nalways putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes, here, there,\neverywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my hand on it, and\nhugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making investments, and\ngetting interest, and living like a prince; and so long as I think of\nthis I make light of all the hardships I endure with this simpleton of a\nmaster of mine, who, I well know, is more of a madman than a knight.\"\n\n\"There's why they say that 'covetousness bursts the bag,'\" said he of the\nGrove; \"but if you come to talk of that sort, there is not a greater one\nin the world than my master, for he is one of those of whom they say,\n'the cares of others kill the ass;' for, in order that another knight may\nrecover the senses he has lost, he makes a madman of himself and goes\nlooking for what, when found, may, for all I know, fly in his own face.\"\n\"And is he in love perchance?\" asked Sancho.\n\n\"He is,\" said of the Grove, \"with one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawest\nand best roasted lady the whole world could produce; but that rawness is\nnot the only foot he limps on, for he has greater schemes rumbling in his\nbowels, as will be seen before many hours are over.\"\n\n\"There's no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,\" said\nSancho; \"in other houses they cook beans, but in mine it's by the potful;\nmadness will have more followers and hangers-on than sound sense; but if\nthere be any truth in the common saying, that to have companions in\ntrouble gives some relief, I may take consolation from you, inasmuch as\nyou serve a master as crazy as my own.\"\n\n\"Crazy but valiant,\" replied he of the Grove, \"and more roguish than\ncrazy or valiant.\"\n\n\"Mine is not that,\" said Sancho; \"I mean he has nothing of the rogue in\nhim; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thought of\ndoing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malice whatever in\nhim; a child might persuade him that it is night at noonday; and for this\nsimplicity I love him as the core of my heart, and I can't bring myself\nto leave him, let him do ever such foolish things.\"\n\n\"For all that, brother and senor,\" said he of the Grove, \"if the blind\nlead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It is better\nfor us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters; for\nthose who seek adventures don't always find good ones.\"\n\nSancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat\nropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove said,\n\"It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are sticking\nto the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener hanging\nfrom the saddle-bow of my horse,\" and getting up he came back the next\nminute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard across; and this\nis no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit so big that Sancho,\nas he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not to say a kid, and\nlooking at it he said, \"And do you carry this with you, senor?\"\n\n\"Why, what are you thinking about?\" said the other; \"do you take me for\nsome paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse's croup than a\ngeneral takes with him when he goes on a march.\"\n\nSancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted\nmouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, \"You are a proper\ntrusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this\nbanquet shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate\nhas the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more\nin my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a\ngiant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many\nmore filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and the\nidea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not live or\nsustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and the herbs of the\nfield.\"\n\n\"By my faith, brother,\" said he of the Grove, \"my stomach is not made for\nthistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods; let our masters do as\nthey like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and eat what those\nenjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the saddle-bow,\nwhatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship with me, and I\nlove it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing and embracing\nit over and over again;\" and so saying he thrust it into Sancho's hands,\nwho raising it aloft pointed to his mouth, gazed at the stars for a\nquarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking let his head fall on\none side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, \"Ah, whoreson rogue, how\ncatholic it is!\"\n\n\"There, you see,\" said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho's exclamation,\n\"how you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sancho, \"I own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to call\nanyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise. But tell me,\nsenor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?\"\n\n\"O rare wine-taster!\" said he of the Grove; \"nowhere else indeed does it\ncome from, and it has some years' age too.\"\n\n\"Leave me alone for that,\" said Sancho; \"never fear but I'll hit upon the\nplace it came from somehow. What would you say, sir squire, to my having\nsuch a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let\nme smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour\nand soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that\nappertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I have had in my family,\non my father's side, the two best wine-tasters that have been known in La\nMancha for many a long year, and to prove it I'll tell you now a thing\nthat happened them. They gave the two of them some wine out of a cask, to\ntry, asking their opinion as to the condition, quality, goodness or\nbadness of the wine. One of them tried it with the tip of his tongue, the\nother did no more than bring it to his nose. The first said the wine had\na flavour of iron, the second said it had a stronger flavour of cordovan.\nThe owner said the cask was clean, and that nothing had been added to the\nwine from which it could have got a flavour of either iron or leather.\nNevertheless, these two great wine-tasters held to what they had said.\nTime went by, the wine was sold, and when they came to clean out the\ncask, they found in it a small key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see\nnow if one who comes of the same stock has not a right to give his\nopinion in such like cases.\"\n\n\"Therefore, I say,\" said he of the Grove, \"let us give up going in quest\nof adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking for cakes, but\nreturn to our cribs, for God will find us there if it be his will.\"\n\n\"Until my master reaches Saragossa,\" said Sancho, \"I'll remain in his\nservice; after that we'll see.\"\n\nThe end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so much\nthat sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for to\nquench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clinging to\nthe now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in their mouths;\nand there we will leave them for the present, to relate what passed\nbetween the Knight of the Grove and him of the Rueful Countenance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GROVE\n\n\nAmong the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the\nWood, the history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, \"In fine,\nsir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly\nspeaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea de\nVandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be in\nbodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same\nCasildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and\ngentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules, to\nengage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me\nthat, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes should be\nattained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link until they\nare past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be\nthe beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires. On one occasion\nshe bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda\nby name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass, and though\nnever stirring from one spot, is the most restless and changeable woman\nin the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I made her stay quiet and\nbehave herself, for nothing but north winds blew for more than a week.\nAnother time I was ordered to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls\nof Guisando, an enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters\nthan to knights. Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of\nCabra--an unparalleled and awful peril--and bring her a minute account of\nall that is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the\nGiralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern\nand brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead\nas dead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be\nbrief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces\nof Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess\nthat she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the\nmost valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of\nwhich claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and\nhave there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me;\nbut what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in\nsingle combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made\nhim confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in\nthis one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the\nworld; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and\nI having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed\nand are transferred to my person; for\n\n  The more the vanquished hath of fair renown,\n  The greater glory gilds the victor's crown.\n\nThus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set\ndown to my account and have become mine.\"\n\nDon Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was a\nthousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie\ndirect already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as\nwell as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own\nlips; so he said to him quietly, \"As to what you say, sir knight, about\nhaving vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole\nworld, I say nothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La\nMancha I consider doubtful; it may have been some other that resembled\nhim, although there are few like him.\"\n\n\"How! not vanquished?\" said he of the Grove; \"by the heaven that is above\nus I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a\nman of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning\ngrey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping\nmoustaches; he does battle under the name of 'The Countenance,' and he\nhas for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza; he presses the loins and\nrules the reins of a famous steed called Rocinante; and lastly, he has\nfor the mistress of his will a certain Dulcinea del Toboso, once upon a\ntime called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as I call mine Casildea de Vandalia\nbecause her name is Casilda and she is of Andalusia. If all these tokens\nare not enough to vindicate the truth of what I say, here is my sword,\nthat will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, sir knight,\" said Don Quixote, \"and give ear to what I am\nabout to say to you. I would have you know that this Don Quixote you\nspeak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that I\nmay say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and from the\nprecise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that he\nmust be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see with\nmy eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been the\nsame; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are\nenchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, some one\nof these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to be\nvanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted\nachievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the\nknown world. And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too, that it\nis but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the\nshape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a foul and mean\nvillage lass, and in the same way they must have transformed Don Quixote;\nand if all this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what I\nsay, here is Don Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot\nor on horseback or in any way you please.\"\n\nAnd so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see\nwhat the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said\nin reply, \"Pledges don't distress a good payer; he who has succeeded in\nvanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, may fairly hope\nto subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is not becoming for\nknights to perform their feats of arms in the dark, like highwaymen and\nbullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun may behold our deeds;\nand the conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquished shall be at\nthe victor's disposal, to do all that he may enjoin, provided the\ninjunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.\"\n\n\"I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,\" replied Don\nQuixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their squires\nlay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in when\nsleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horses\nready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous single\ncombat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck,\ntrembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds he had\nheard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a word the two\nsquires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the three horses\nand the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.\n\nOn the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, \"You must know, brother, that\nit is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are\ngodfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while their\ngodsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are\nfighting, we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.\"\n\n\"That custom, sir squire,\" replied Sancho, \"may hold good among those\nbullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the squires\nof knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak of any\ncustom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantry by\nheart; but granting it true that there is an express law that squires are\nto fight while their masters are fighting, I don't mean to obey it, but\nto pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded squires like\nmyself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds of wax, and I\nwould rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less than the lint I\nshall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I look upon as broken\nand split already; there's another thing that makes it impossible for me\nto fight, that I have no sword, for I never carried one in my life.\"\n\n\"I know a good remedy for that,\" said he of the Grove; \"I have here two\nlinen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the other, and we\nwill fight at bag blows with equal arms.\"\n\n\"If that's the way, so be it with all my heart,\" said Sancho, \"for that\nsort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead of hurting\nus.\"\n\n\"That will not do,\" said the other, \"for we must put into the bags, to\nkeep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles,\nall of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able to baste one\nanother without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.\"\n\n\"Body of my father!\" said Sancho, \"see what marten and sable, and pads of\ncarded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our heads may not be\nbroken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if they are filled with\ntoss silk, I can tell you, senor, I am not going to fight; let our\nmasters fight, that's their lookout, and let us drink and live; for time\nwill take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to look for\nfillips so that they may be finished off before their proper time comes\nand they drop from ripeness.\"\n\n\"Still,\" returned he of the Grove, \"we must fight, if it be only for half\nan hour.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said Sancho; \"I am not going to be so discourteous or so\nungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small, with one I have\neaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring himself to fight\nin cold blood, without anger or provocation?\"\n\n\"I can remedy that entirely,\" said he of the Grove, \"and in this way:\nbefore we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair and\nsoftly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretch\nyou at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounder than\na dormouse.\"\n\n\"To match that plan,\" said Sancho, \"I have another that is not a whit\nbehind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes near\nenough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with whacks,\nthat it won't waken unless it be in the other world, where it is known\nthat I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; let each look\nout for the arrow--though the surer way would be to let everyone's anger\nsleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man may come for wool\nand go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace and his curse to\nquarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed, turns into a\nlion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and so from this\ntime forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and mischief that\nmay come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said he of the Grove; \"God will send the dawn and we shall\nbe all right.\"\n\nAnd now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees, and\nwith their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute the\nfresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance at\nthe gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a profusion\nof liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too,\nseemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled\nsweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods\nrejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her\ncoming. But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and\ndistinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the\neyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove's nose, which was so big\nthat it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact, stated, that\nit was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of\na mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers' length\nbelow his mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it,\nmade his face so hideous, that Sancho, as he looked at him, began to\ntremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his\nheart to let himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be\nprovoked to fight that monster. Don Quixote examined his adversary, and\nfound that he already had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he\ncould not see his face; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily\nbuilt man, but not very tall in stature. Over his armour he wore a\nsurcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all\nbespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an\nextremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a\ngreat quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which\nwas leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel\npoint more than a palm in length.\n\nDon Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and\nobserved he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great\nstrength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho\nPanza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the\nKnight of the Mirrors, \"If, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has\nnot banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visor\na little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance\ncorresponds with that of your equipment.\"\n\n\"Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir\nknight,\" replied he of the Mirrors, \"you will have more than enough time\nand leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your request, it\nis because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair\nCasildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor\nbefore compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Don Quixote, \"while we are mounting you can at least\ntell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.\"\n\n\"To that we answer you,\" said he of the Mirrors, \"that you are as like\nthe very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say\nenchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether\nyou are the said person or not.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"is enough to convince me that you are under a\ndeception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be\nbrought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if\nGod, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face,\nand you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to\nbe.\"\n\nWith this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote\nwheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back\nupon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote\nhad not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the\nother, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him,\n\"Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the\nvanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor's disposal.\"\n\n\"I am aware of it already,\" said Don Quixote; \"provided what is commanded\nand imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the\nlimits of chivalry.\"\n\n\"That is understood,\" replied he of the Mirrors.\n\nAt this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to\nDon Quixote's view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight;\ninsomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human being\nof some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master\nretiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy\nman, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle would\nbe all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, either\nby the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to\nRocinante's stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turn\nabout, he said, \"I implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to\ncharge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able to\nwitness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this\nknight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.\"\n\n\"It seems to me rather, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou wouldst\nmount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.\"\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" returned Sancho, \"the monstrous nose of that squire\nhas filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near him.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Don Quixote, \"such a one that were I not what I am it would\nterrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.\"\n\nWhile Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the\nMirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing\nDon Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of\ntrumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was\nnot more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed,\nwhich was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him,\nhowever, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid\ncareer, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already unable\nto go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon him\nflying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante's lean flanks and made\nhim scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this\noccasion only was he known to make something like running, for on all\nothers it was a simple trot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he\nbore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse\nup to buttons, without being able to make him stir a finger's length from\nthe spot where he had come to a standstill in his course. At this lucky\nmoment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with\nhis horse, and embarrassed with his lance, which he either could not\nmanage, or had no time to lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no\nattention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and\nwithout any risk encountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he\nbrought him to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his\nhorse, and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not\nstirring hand or foot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from\nthe cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who,\ndismounting from Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and\nunlacing his helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he\nshould happen to be alive, he saw--who can say what he saw, without\nfilling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? He saw, the\nhistory says, the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the\nvery physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor Samson\nCarrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice, \"Make haste\nhere, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to believe; quick,\nmy son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and enchanters are\ncapable of.\"\n\nSancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor Carrasco,\nhe fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as\nmany more. All this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life,\nand Sancho said to Don Quixote, \"It is my opinion, senor, that in any\ncase your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of\nthis one here that looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in\nhim you will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.\"\n\n\"Thy advice is not bad,\" said Don Quixote, \"for of enemies the fewer the\nbetter;\" and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect Sancho's\ncounsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, now\nwithout the nose which had made him so hideous, and cried out in a loud\nvoice, \"Mind what you are about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend,\nthe bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his\nsquire.\"\n\n\"And the nose?\" said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he\nhad before; to which he replied, \"I have it here in my pocket,\" and\nputting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose\nof varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho,\nexamining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of\namazement, \"Holy Mary be good to me! Isn't it Tom Cecial, my neighbour\nand gossip?\"\n\n\"Why, to be sure I am!\" returned the now unnosed squire; \"Tom Cecial I\nam, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I'll tell you presently the means\nand tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but in the\nmeantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound,\nor slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet; because,\nbeyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor Samson\nCarrasco, our fellow townsman.\"\n\nAt this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote\nperceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said\nto him, \"You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless\nDulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in\naddition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter\nand fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her\non my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and\nif she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and\nseek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide\nto lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed between\nyou and her-conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated\nbefore our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry.\"\n\n\"I confess,\" said the fallen knight, \"that the dirty tattered shoe of the\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard\nof Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence to\nyours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of\nme.\"\n\n\"You must also confess and believe,\" added Don Quixote, \"that the knight\nyou vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but\nsome one else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you,\nthough you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some\nother resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his\nshape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my\nwrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.\"\n\n\"I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and\nthink it,\" the crippled knight; \"let me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed,\nthe shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight\nenough.\"\n\nDon Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom\nCecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put\nquestions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really\nand truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho's\nmind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face\nof the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco,\nwould not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes. In fine, both\nmaster and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and\nout of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote and\nSancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and\nstrap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to\nSaragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell\nwho the Knight of the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nWHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE\nWERE\n\n\nDon Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest\ndegree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied\nhim of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected to\nlearn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as\nthe said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be\none, to return and render him an account of what took place between him\nand her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another,\nfor he just then had no thought of anything but finding some village\nwhere he could plaster himself, as has been said already. The history\ngoes on to say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended\nDon Quixote to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was\nin consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and\nthe barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at\nhome in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred\nadventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of\nall, and on the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be\nallowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson\nshould sally forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with\nhim, for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him,\nthat being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed\nand settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.\nThen, Don Quixote being vanquished, the bachelor knight was to command\nhim to return to his village and his house, and not quit it for two\nyears, or until he received further orders from him; all which it was\nclear Don Quixote would unhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or\nfail to observe the laws of chivalry; and during the period of his\nseclusion he might perhaps forget his folly, or there might be an\nopportunity of discovering some ready remedy for his madness. Carrasco\nundertook the task, and Tom Cecial, a gossip and neighbour of Sancho\nPanza's, a lively, feather-headed fellow, offered himself as his squire.\nCarrasco armed himself in the fashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he\nmight not be known by his gossip when they met, fitted on over his own\nnatural nose the false masquerade one that has been mentioned; and so\nthey followed the same route Don Quixote took, and almost came up with\nhim in time to be present at the adventure of the cart of Death and\nfinally encountered them in the grove, where all that the sagacious\nreader has been reading about took place; and had it not been for the\nextraordinary fancies of Don Quixote, and his conviction that the\nbachelor was not the bachelor, senor bachelor would have been\nincapacitated for ever from taking his degree of licentiate, all through\nnot finding nests where he thought to find birds.\n\nTom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their\nexpedition had come to, said to the bachelor, \"Sure enough, Senor Samson\nCarrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set about an\nenterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it.\nDon Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and sound,\nand you are left sore and sorry! I'd like to know now which is the\nmadder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his\nown choice?\"\n\nTo which Samson replied, \"The difference between the two sorts of madmen\nis, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is\nso of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Tom Cecial, \"I was a madman of my own accord when I\nvolunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I'll leave off\nbeing one and go home.\"\n\n\"That's your affair,\" returned Samson, \"but to suppose that I am going\nhome until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not\nany wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out\nnow, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won't let me\nentertain more charitable thoughts.\"\n\nThus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it\nwas their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the\nunfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he\nstayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him\nagain at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote\nnow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA\n\n\nDon Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and\nself-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous\nknight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. All\nthe adventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded as\nalready done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of enchantments\nand enchanters; he thought no more of the countless drubbings that had\nbeen administered to him in the course of his knight-errantry, nor of the\nvolley of stones that had levelled half his teeth, nor of the ingratitude\nof the galley slaves, nor of the audacity of the Yanguesans and the\nshower of stakes that fell upon him; in short, he said to himself that\ncould he discover any means, mode, or way of disenchanting his lady\nDulcinea, he would not envy the highest fortune that the most fortunate\nknight-errant of yore ever reached or could reach.\n\nHe was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho said\nto him, \"Isn't it odd, senor, that I have still before my eyes that\nmonstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?\"\n\n\"And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that the\nKnight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and his squire Tom\nCecial thy gossip?\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say to that,\" replied Sancho; \"all I know is that\nthe tokens he gave me about my own house, wife and children, nobody else\nbut himself could have given me; and the face, once the nose was off, was\nthe very face of Tom Cecial, as I have seen it many a time in my town and\nnext door to my own house; and the sound of the voice was just the same.\"\n\n\"Let us reason the matter, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"Come now, by what\nprocess of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelor Samson Carrasco\nwould come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive and defensive, to fight\nwith me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy? Have I ever given him\nany occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival, or does he profess arms,\nthat he should envy the fame I have acquired in them?\"\n\n\"Well, but what are we to say, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"about that\nknight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelor Carrasco, and his\nsquire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that be enchantment, as your\nworship says, was there no other pair in the world for them to take the\nlikeness of?\"\n\n\"It is all,\" said Don Quixote, \"a scheme and plot of the malignant\nmagicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to be victorious\nin the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight should display the\ncountenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that the friendship I\nbear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword and might of my\narm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he who sought to take\nmy life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. And to prove it, thou\nknowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot lie or deceive, how\neasy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into another, turning\nfair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not two days since thou\nsawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless\nDulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I saw her in\nthe repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, with cataracts in\nher eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and when the perverse enchanter\nventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no wonder if he\neffected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch the\nglory of victory out of my grasp. For all that, however, I console\nmyself, because, after all, in whatever shape he may have been, I have\nvictorious over my enemy.\"\n\n\"God knows what's the truth of it all,\" said Sancho; and knowing as he\ndid that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device and imposition\nof his own, his master's illusions were not satisfactory to him; but he\ndid not like to reply lest he should say something that might disclose\nhis trickery.\n\nAs they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man\nwho was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome\nflea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with tawny\nvelvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings of the\nmare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry colour and\ngreen. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and gold\nbaldric; the buskins were of the same make as the baldric; the spurs were\nnot gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly polished that, matching as\nthey did the rest of his apparel, they looked better than if they had\nbeen of pure gold.\n\nWhen the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, and\nspurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixote\ncalled out to him, \"Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going our road,\nand has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if we were to\njoin company.\"\n\n\"In truth,\" replied he on the mare, \"I would not pass you so hastily but\nfor fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare.\"\n\n\"You may safely hold in your mare, senor,\" said Sancho in reply to this,\n\"for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behaved horse in the world;\nhe never does anything wrong on such occasions, and the only time he\nmisbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; I say again your\nworship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered to him between\ntwo plates the horse would not hanker after her.\"\n\nThe traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of Don Quixote,\nwho rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like a valise in front\nof Dapple's pack-saddle; and if the man in green examined Don Quixote\nclosely, still more closely did Don Quixote examine the man in green, who\nstruck him as being a man of intelligence. In appearance he was about\nfifty years of age, with but few grey hairs, an aquiline cast of\nfeatures, and an expression between grave and gay; and his dress and\naccoutrements showed him to be a man of good condition. What he in green\nthought of Don Quixote of La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shape\nhe had never yet seen; he marvelled at the length of his hair, his lofty\nstature, the lankness and sallowness of his countenance, his armour, his\nbearing and his gravity--a figure and picture such as had not been seen\nin those regions for many a long day.\n\nDon Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller was\nregarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and courteous\nas he was and ready to please everybody, before the other could ask him\nany question he anticipated him by saying, \"The appearance I present to\nyour worship being so strange and so out of the common, I should not be\nsurprised if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder when\nI tell you, as I do, that I am one of those knights who, as people say,\ngo seeking adventures. I have left my home, I have mortgaged my estate, I\nhave given up my comforts, and committed myself to the arms of Fortune,\nto bear me whithersoever she may please. My desire was to bring to life\nagain knight-errantry, now dead, and for some time past, stumbling here,\nfalling there, now coming down headlong, now raising myself up again, I\nhave carried out a great portion of my design, succouring widows,\nprotecting maidens, and giving aid to wives, orphans, and minors, the\nproper and natural duty of knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my\nmany valiant and Christian achievements, I have been already found worthy\nto make my way in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the\nearth. Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is\non the high-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if\nheaven does not put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words,\nor in a single one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\notherwise called 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;' for though\nself-praise is degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that is\nto say, when there is no one at hand to do it for me. So that, gentle\nsir, neither this horse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor this\nsquire, nor all these arms put together, nor the sallowness of my\ncountenance, nor my gaunt leanness, will henceforth astonish you, now\nthat you know who I am and what profession I follow.\"\n\nWith these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took\nto answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a\nlong pause, however, he said to him, \"You were right when you saw\ncuriosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded in\nremoving the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,\nsenor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so;\non the contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished\nthan before. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the\nworld in these days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannot\nrealise the fact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids\nwidows, or protects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor\nshould I believe it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes.\nBlessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and genuine\nchivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories\nof fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to\nthe injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories,\nwill have been driven into oblivion.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal to be said on that point,\" said Don Quixote, \"as to\nwhether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not.\"\n\n\"Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?\" said\nthe man in green.\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Don Quixote, \"but never mind that just now; if our\njourney lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show your worship that\nyou do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a matter\nof certainty that they are not true.\"\n\nFrom this last observation of Don Quixote's, the traveller began to have\na suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him to confirm\nit by something further; but before they could turn to any new subject\nDon Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he himself had\nrendered account of his station and life. To this, he in the green gaban\nreplied \"I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am a gentleman by\nbirth, native of the village where, please God, we are going to dine\ntoday; I am more than fairly well off, and my name is Don Diego de\nMiranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, and friends; my pursuits\nare hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks nor greyhounds, nothing\nbut a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; I have six dozen or so of\nbooks, some in our mother tongue, some Latin, some of them history,\nothers devotional; those of chivalry have not as yet crossed the\nthreshold of my door; I am more given to turning over the profane than\nthe devotional, so long as they are books of honest entertainment that\ncharm by their style and attract and interest by the invention they\ndisplay, though of these there are very few in Spain. Sometimes I dine\nwith my neighbours and friends, and often invite them; my entertainments\nare neat and well served without stint of anything. I have no taste for\ntattle, nor do I allow tattling in my presence; I pry not into my\nneighbours' lives, nor have I lynx-eyes for what others do. I hear mass\nevery day; I share my substance with the poor, making no display of good\nworks, lest I let hypocrisy and vainglory, those enemies that subtly take\npossession of the most watchful heart, find an entrance into mine. I\nstrive to make peace between those whom I know to be at variance; I am\nthe devoted servant of Our Lady, and my trust is ever in the infinite\nmercy of God our Lord.\"\n\nSancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of the\ngentleman's life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holy life,\nand that he who led it ought to work miracles, he threw himself off\nDapple, and running in haste seized his right stirrup and kissed his foot\nagain and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.\n\nSeeing this the gentleman asked him, \"What are you about, brother? What\nare these kisses for?\"\n\n\"Let me kiss,\" said Sancho, \"for I think your worship is the first saint\nin the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.\"\n\n\"I am no saint,\" replied the gentleman, \"but a great sinner; but you are,\nbrother, for you must be a good fellow, as your simplicity shows.\"\n\nSancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laugh\nfrom his master's profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazement in Don\nDiego. Don Quixote then asked him how many children he had, and observed\nthat one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who were without\nthe true knowledge of God, placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of\nnature, in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and good\nchildren.\n\n\"I, Senor Don Quixote,\" answered the gentleman, \"have one son, without\nwhom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am, not because he is\na bad son, but because he is not so good as I could wish. He is eighteen\nyears of age; he has been for six at Salamanca studying Latin and Greek,\nand when I wished him to turn to the study of other sciences I found him\nso wrapped up in that of poetry (if that can be called a science) that\nthere is no getting him to take kindly to the law, which I wished him to\nstudy, or to theology, the queen of them all. I would like him to be an\nhonour to his family, as we live in days when our kings liberally reward\nlearning that is virtuous and worthy; for learning without virtue is a\npearl on a dunghill. He spends the whole day in settling whether Homer\nexpressed himself correctly or not in such and such a line of the Iliad,\nwhether Martial was indecent or not in such and such an epigram, whether\nsuch and such lines of Virgil are to be understood in this way or in\nthat; in short, all his talk is of the works of these poets, and those of\nHorace, Perseus, Juvenal, and Tibullus; for of the moderns in our own\nlanguage he makes no great account; but with all his seeming indifference\nto Spanish poetry, just now his thoughts are absorbed in making a gloss\non four lines that have been sent him from Salamanca, which I suspect are\nfor some poetical tournament.\"\n\nTo all this Don Quixote said in reply, \"Children, senor, are portions of\ntheir parents' bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to be\nloved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to\nguide them from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy\nChristian conduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their\nparents' old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them to\nstudy this or that science I do not think wise, though it may be no harm\nto persuade them; and when there is no need to study for the sake of pane\nlucrando, and it is the student's good fortune that heaven has given him\nparents who provide him with it, it would be my advice to them to let him\npursue whatever science they may see him most inclined to; and though\nthat of poetry is less useful than pleasurable, it is not one of those\nthat bring discredit upon the possessor. Poetry, gentle sir, is, as I\ntake it, like a tender young maiden of supreme beauty, to array, bedeck,\nand adorn whom is the task of several other maidens, who are all the rest\nof the sciences; and she must avail herself of the help of all, and all\nderive their lustre from her. But this maiden will not bear to be\nhandled, nor dragged through the streets, nor exposed either at the\ncorners of the market-places, or in the closets of palaces. She is the\nproduct of an Alchemy of such virtue that he who is able to practise it,\nwill turn her into pure gold of inestimable worth. He that possesses her\nmust keep her within bounds, not permitting her to break out in ribald\nsatires or soulless sonnets. She must on no account be offered for sale,\nunless, indeed, it be in heroic poems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and\ningenious comedies. She must not be touched by the buffoons, nor by the\nignorant vulgar, incapable of comprehending or appreciating her hidden\ntreasures. And do not suppose, senor, that I apply the term vulgar here\nmerely to plebeians and the lower orders; for everyone who is ignorant,\nbe he lord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar. He,\nthen, who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I have\nnamed, shall become famous, and his name honoured throughout all the\ncivilised nations of the earth. And with regard to what you say, senor,\nof your son having no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined to\nthink that he is not quite right there, and for this reason: the great\npoet Homer did not write in Latin, because he was a Greek, nor did Virgil\nwrite in Greek, because he was a Latin; in short, all the ancient poets\nwrote in the language they imbibed with their mother's milk, and never\nwent in quest of foreign ones to express their sublime conceptions; and\nthat being so, the usage should in justice extend to all nations, and the\nGerman poet should not be undervalued because he writes in his own\nlanguage, nor the Castilian, nor even the Biscayan, for writing in his.\nBut your son, senor, I suspect, is not prejudiced against Spanish poetry,\nbut against those poets who are mere Spanish verse writers, without any\nknowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and give life and\nvigour to their natural inspiration; and yet even in this he may be\nwrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet is born one; that is to\nsay, the poet by nature comes forth a poet from his mother's womb; and\nfollowing the bent that heaven has bestowed upon him, without the aid of\nstudy or art, he produces things that show how truly he spoke who said,\n'Est Deus in nobis,' etc. At the same time, I say that the poet by nature\nwho calls in art to his aid will be a far better poet, and will surpass\nhim who tries to be one relying upon his knowledge of art alone. The\nreason is, that art does not surpass nature, but only brings it to\nperfection; and thus, nature combined with art, and art with nature, will\nproduce a perfect poet. To bring my argument to a close, I would say\nthen, gentle sir, let your son go on as his star leads him, for being so\nstudious as he seems to be, and having already successfully surmounted\nthe first step of the sciences, which is that of the languages, with\ntheir help he will by his own exertions reach the summit of polite\nliterature, which so well becomes an independent gentleman, and adorns,\nhonours, and distinguishes him, as much as the mitre does the bishop, or\nthe gown the learned counsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on\nthe honour of others, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he\ncompose discourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of\nHorace, and with elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for\na poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the\nother vices too, provided he does not single out individuals; there are,\nhowever, poets who, for the sake of saying something spiteful, would run\nthe risk of being banished to the coast of Pontus. If the poet be pure in\nhis morals, he will be pure in his verses too; the pen is the tongue of\nthe mind, and as the thought engendered there, so will be the things that\nit writes down. And when kings and princes observe this marvellous\nscience of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtful subjects, they\nhonour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the leaves of that\ntree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show that they whose\nbrows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed\nby anyone.\"\n\nHe of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote's\nargument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken up\nabout his being crazy. But in the middle of the discourse, it being not\nvery much to his taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg a\nlittle milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard by; and\njust as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew the\nconversation, Don Quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart covered\nwith royal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and\npersuaded that this must be some new adventure, he called aloud to Sancho\nto come and bring him his helmet. Sancho, hearing himself called, quitted\nthe shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up to his master, to\nwhom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nWHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLED\nCOURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THE HAPPILY\nACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS\n\n\nThe history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring him\nhis helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell\nhim, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what\nto do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he\nhad already paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his\nmaster's helmet, and acting on this bright idea he went to see what his\nmaster wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him:\n\n\"Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of adventures,\nor what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm\nmyself.\"\n\nHe of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but\ncould perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or\nthree small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure\nof the King's, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would not\nbelieve him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened\nto him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the\ngentleman, \"He who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothing is\nlost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I have\nenemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at what\nmoment, or in what shapes they will attack me;\" and turning to Sancho he\ncalled for his helmet; and Sancho, as he had no time to take out the\ncurds, had to give it just as it was. Don Quixote took it, and without\nperceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his head; but\nas the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his\nface and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to Sancho:\n\n\"Sancho, what's this? I think my head is softening, or my brains are\nmelting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating it is not\nindeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure which\nis about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something to wipe myself\nwith, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding me.\"\n\nSancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at\nthe same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. Don\nQuixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was\nthat made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside\nhis helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast\nput here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!\"\n\nTo which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,\n\"If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I'll eat them; but\nlet the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them there. I\ndare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender finely! Faith,\nsir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have enchanters too, that\npersecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have\nput that nastiness there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and\nmake you baste my ribs as you are wont to do. Well, this time, indeed,\nthey have missed their aim, for I trust to my master's good sense to see\nthat I have got no curds or milk, or anything of the sort; and that if I\nhad it is in my stomach I would put it and not in the helmet.\"\n\n\"May be so,\" said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was observing, and\nwith astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himself\nclean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on, and\nsettling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the\nscabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, \"Now, come who will, here am\nI, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!\"\n\nBy this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone\nexcept the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixote\nplanted himself before it and said, \"Whither are you going, brothers?\nWhat cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?\"\n\nTo this the carter replied, \"The cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of\nwild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court as a\npresent to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King's, to show\nthat what is here is his property.\"\n\n\"And are the lions large?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"So large,\" replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, \"that\nlarger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the\nkeeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. They\nare male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the\none behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day,\nso let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place\nwhere we are to feed them.\"\n\nHereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Lion-whelps to me! to\nme whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those gentlemen who\nsend them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions. Get\ndown, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages, and turn\nme out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will let them know\nwho Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of the\nenchanters who send them to me.\"\n\n\"So, so,\" said the gentleman to himself at this; \"our worthy knight has\nshown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull\nand brought his brains to a head.\"\n\nAt this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, \"Senor, for God's sake do\nsomething to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions; for\nif he does they'll tear us all to pieces here.\"\n\n\"Is your master then so mad,\" asked the gentleman, \"that you believe and\nare afraid he will engage such fierce animals?\"\n\n\"He is not mad,\" said Sancho, \"but he is venturesome.\"\n\n\"I will prevent it,\" said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote,\nwho was insisting upon the keeper's opening the cages, he said to him,\n\"Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage the\nhope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it; for\nvalour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than of\ncourage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do they\ndream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty, and it\nwill not be right to stop them or delay their journey.\"\n\n\"Gentle sir,\" replied Don Quixote, \"you go and mind your tame partridge\nand your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business; this\nis mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me or not;\"\nand then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, \"By all that's good, sir\nscoundrel, if you don't open the cages this very instant, I'll pin you to\nthe cart with this lance.\"\n\nThe carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said\nto him, \"Please your worship, for charity's sake, senor, let me unyoke\nthe mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions are\nturned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, for all I\npossess is this cart and mules.\"\n\n\"O man of little faith,\" replied Don Quixote, \"get down and unyoke; you\nwill soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you\nmight have spared yourself the trouble.\"\n\nThe carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper\ncalled out at the top of his voice, \"I call all here to witness that\nagainst my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lions\nloose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for all\nthe harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary and\ndues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open,\nfor I know they will do me no harm.\"\n\nOnce more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a\nmad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To\nthis, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman\nin return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion.\n\n\"Well, senor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"if you do not like to be a\nspectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your\nflea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.\"\n\nHearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an\nenterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful\none of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in\nthe whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. \"Look ye,\nsenor,\" said Sancho, \"there's no enchantment here, nor anything of the\nsort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of\na real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could\nbelong to must be bigger than a mountain.\"\n\n\"Fear at any rate,\" replied Don Quixote, \"will make him look bigger to\nthee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die here\nthou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea--I say no\nmore.\" To these he added some further words that banished all hope of his\ngiving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would have offered\nresistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did not\nthink it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixote now\nshowed himself to be in every respect; and the latter, renewing his\ncommands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave warning to the\ngentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the carter his mules,\nall striving to get away from the cart as far as they could before the\nlions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his master's death, for this\ntime he firmly believed it was in store for him from the claws of the\nlions; and he cursed his fate and called it an unlucky hour when he\nthought of taking service with him again; but with all his tears and\nlamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple so as to put a good space\nbetween himself and the cart. The keeper, seeing that the fugitives were\nnow some distance off, once more entreated and warned him as before; but\nhe replied that he heard him, and that he need not trouble himself with\nany further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade\nhim make haste.\n\nDuring the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first\ncage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do\nbattle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on\nfoot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions;\nhe therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced his\nbuckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with\nmarvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of\nthe cart, commending himself with all his heart to God and to his lady\nDulcinea.\n\nIt is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this\nveracious history breaks out into exclamations. \"O doughty Don Quixote!\nhigh-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of the world\nmay see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once the glory and\nhonour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I describe this dread\nexploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages to come, what\neulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles piled on\nhyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a simple\nsword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield, but\nno bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting the\ntwo fiercest lions that Africa's forests ever bred! Thy own deeds be thy\npraise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as they stand, wanting\nthe words wherewith to glorify them!\"\n\nHere the author's outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take up\nthe thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don Quixote\nhad taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him to avoid\nletting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring\nknight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been\nsaid, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and\nhideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in\nwhich he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he\nnext opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two\npalms' length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out\nof his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of\nthe cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle\nand demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merely\nobserved him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to\nclose quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces.\n\nSo far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more\ncourteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after\nhaving looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his\nhind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down\nagain in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take a\nstick to him and provoke him to make him come out.\n\n\"That I won't,\" said the keeper; \"for if I anger him, the first he'll\ntear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you\nhave done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage,\nand do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion has the door\nopen; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has not come\nout so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship's great courage has\nbeen fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it strikes me, is\nbound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him on the field;\nif his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace, and he who\nwaits for him carries off the crown of victory.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote; \"close the door, my friend, and let me\nhave, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way of\ncertificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I waited for\nhim, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him, and that\nstill he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not bound to do more;\nenchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth, and true\nchivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals to the\nfugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit from thy\nlips.\"\n\nThe keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance the\ncloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to\nrecall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every\nstep, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. Sancho, however,\nhappening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, \"May I\ndie, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to\nus.\"\n\nThey all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making\nsignals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached\nslowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote's voice\ncalling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they came\nup, Don Quixote said to the carter, \"Put your mules to once more,\nbrother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two\ngold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they\nhave incurred through me.\"\n\n\"That will I give with all my heart,\" said Sancho; \"but what has become\nof the lions? Are they dead or alive?\"\n\nThe keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of\nthe contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of\nDon Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and\ndared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever\nso long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the\nknight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him\nout, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether\nagainst his will, had allowed the door to be closed.\n\n\"What dost thou think of this, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote. \"Are there any\nenchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchanters may be\nable to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage they\ncannot.\"\n\nSancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don\nQuixote's hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an\naccount of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he saw him\nat court.\n\n\"Then,\" said Don Quixote, \"if his Majesty should happen to ask who\nperformed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire\nthat into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed, and\nturned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant, who\nchanged their names when they pleased, or when it suited their purpose.\"\n\nThe cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gaban\nwent theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word,\nbeing entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote\ndid and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains\ngone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of his\nhistory had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with\nwhich his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would\nthen have understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of\nit, he took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what\nhe said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did,\nabsurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to himself, \"What could be madder\nthan putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that\nenchanters are softening one's skull; or what could be greater rashness\nand folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?\"\n\nDon Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by\nsaying, \"No doubt, Senor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your\nmind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my\ndeeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have you take\nnotice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have seemed to\nyou. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to bear\nadroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in the midst\nof a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering\narmour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament, and\nall those knights show to advantage that entertain, divert, and, if we\nmay say so, honour the courts of their princes by warlike exercises, or\nwhat resemble them; but to greater advantage than all these does a\nknight-errant show when he traverses deserts, solitudes, cross-roads,\nforests, and mountains, in quest of perilous adventures, bent on bringing\nthem to a happy and successful issue, all to win a glorious and lasting\nrenown. To greater advantage, I maintain, does the knight-errant show\nbringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste, than the court knight\ndallying with some city damsel. All knights have their own special parts\nto play; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies, let him add\nlustre to his sovereign's court by his liveries, let him entertain poor\ngentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table, let him arrange\njoustings, marshal tournaments, and prove himself noble, generous, and\nmagnificent, and above all a good Christian, and so doing he will fulfil\nthe duties that are especially his; but let the knight-errant explore the\ncorners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each\nstep let him attempt impossibilities, on desolate heaths let him endure\nthe burning rays of the midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the\nwinter winds and frosts; let no lions daunt him, no monsters terrify him,\nno dragons make him quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to\nvanquish all, are in truth his main duties. I, then, as it has fallen to\nmy lot to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all\nthat to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my\nbounden duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I\nknew it to be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is,\nthat it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes,\ncowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is\nvaliant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to sink until\nhe reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the prodigal\nthan for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rash man to\nprove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; and believe\nme, Senor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a\ncard too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, 'such a knight\nis rash and daring,' sounds better than 'such a knight is timid and\ncowardly.'\"\n\n\"I protest, Senor Don Quixote,\" said Don Diego, \"everything you have said\nand done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and I believe,\nif the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost, they might\nbe found in your worship's breast as in their own proper depository and\nmuniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my village, where you\nshall take rest after your late exertions; for if they have not been of\nthe body they have been of the spirit, and these sometimes tend to\nproduce bodily fatigue.\"\n\n\"I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Senor Don Diego,\"\nreplied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace than before,\nat about two in the afternoon they reached the village and house of Don\nDiego, or, as Don Quixote called him, \"The Knight of the Green Gaban.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE\nGREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON\n\n\nDon Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda's house built in village style,\nwith his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the\nstore-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars\nstanding round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory\nhis enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking\nof what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed--\n\n  \"O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!\n  Once sweet and welcome when 'twas heaven's good-will.\n\n  \"O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the\n  sweet object of my bitter regrets!\"\n\nThe student poet, Don Diego's son, who had come out with his mother to\nreceive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled\nwith amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however,\ndismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask\npermission to kiss the lady's hand, while Don Diego said, \"Senora, pray\nreceive with your wonted kindness Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom\nyou see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the\nworld.\"\n\nThe lady, whose name was Dona Christina, received him with every sign of\ngood-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her\nservice with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost the\nsame civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening\nto Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person.\n\nHere the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego's\nmansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich\ngentleman-farmer's house; but the translator of the history thought it\nbest to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as\nthey are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong\npoint of which is truth rather than dull digressions.\n\nThey led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leaving\nhim in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained\nwith the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic\ncut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes\npolished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf's\nskin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of\nthe kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. But\nfirst of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number\nof buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still\nthe water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho's greediness and\npurchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thus\narrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed\nout into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him\nwhile the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a\nguest, Dona Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able\nto give a becoming reception to those who came to her house.\n\nWhile Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don\nDiego's son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, \"What\nare we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For\nhis name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have\ncompletely puzzled my mother and me.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to say, my son,\" replied. Don Diego; \"all I can tell\nthee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the\nworld, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and\nundo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and\nas thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to\nhis wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to\ntake him to be mad than sane.\"\n\nWith this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been\nsaid, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don\nQuixote said to Don Lorenzo, \"Your father, Senor Don Diego de Miranda,\nhas told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and,\nabove all, that you are a great poet.\"\n\n\"A poet, it may be,\" replied Don Lorenzo, \"but a great one, by no means.\nIt is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets,\nbut not so much so as to justify the title of 'great' which my father\ngives me.\"\n\n\"I do not dislike that modesty,\" said Don Quixote; \"for there is no poet\nwho is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"There is no rule without an exception,\" said Don Lorenzo; \"there may be\nsome who are poets and yet do not think they are.\"\n\n\"Very few,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me, what verses are those which\nyou have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat\nrestless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something about\nglosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical\ntournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first always\ngoes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice; and so\nthe third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in this way,\nwill be third, in the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at the\nuniversities; but, for all that, the title of first is a great\ndistinction.\"\n\n\"So far,\" said Don Lorenzo to himself, \"I should not take you to be a\nmadman; but let us go on.\" So he said to him, \"Your worship has\napparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?\"\n\n\"That of knight-errantry,\" said Don Quixote, \"which is as good as that of\npoetry, and even a finger or two above it.\"\n\n\"I do not know what science that is,\" said Don Lorenzo, \"and until now I\nhave never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is a science,\" said Don Quixote, \"that comprehends in itself all or\nmost of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be a\njurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable,\nso as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. He must\nbe a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctive reason\nfor the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may be asked of him. He\nmust be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as in wastes and\nsolitudes to know the herbs that have the property of healing wounds, for\na knight-errant must not go looking for some one to cure him at every\nstep. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by the stars how many hours\nof the night have passed, and what clime and quarter of the world he is\nin. He must know mathematics, for at every turn some occasion for them\nwill present itself to him; and, putting it aside that he must be adorned\nwith all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to come down to minor\nparticulars, he must, I say, be able to swim as well as Nicholas or\nNicolao the Fish could, as the story goes; he must know how to shoe a\nhorse, and repair his saddle and bridle; and, to return to higher\nmatters, he must be faithful to God and to his lady; he must be pure in\nthought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient\nin suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder\nof the truth though its defence should cost him his life. Of all these\nqualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then,\nSenor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight\nwho studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare\nwith the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.\"\n\n\"If that be so,\" replied Don Lorenzo, \"this science, I protest, surpasses\nall.\"\n\n\"How, if that be so?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"What I mean to say,\" said Don Lorenzo, \"is, that I doubt whether there\nare now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such\nvirtues.\"\n\n\"Many a time,\" replied Don Quixote, \"have I said what I now say once\nmore, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never were\nany knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless heaven by\nsome miracle brings home to them the truth that there were and are, all\nthe pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has often proved to\nme), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error you share with the\nmultitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliver you from it,\nand show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant were in days of\nyore, and how useful they would be in these days were they but in vogue;\nbut now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and\nluxury are triumphant.\"\n\n\"Our guest has broken out on our hands,\" said Don Lorenzo to himself at\nthis point; \"but, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should be\na dull blockhead to doubt it.\"\n\nHere, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.\nDon Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits\nof their guest. To which he replied, \"All the doctors and clever scribes\nin the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a\nmadman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.\"\n\nThey went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the\nroad he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and\ntasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that\nreigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery.\n\nWhen the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don\nQuixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the\npoetical tournament, to which he replied, \"Not to be like those poets\nwho, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they\nare not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for which I\ndo not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise of\ningenuity.\"\n\n\"A discerning friend of mine,\" said Don Quixote, \"was of opinion that no\none ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gave was\nthat the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or most\nfrequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at in the\nglossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too strict,\nas they did not allow interrogations, nor 'said he,' nor 'I say,' nor\nturning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of\nother restrictions and limitations that fetter gloss-writers, as you no\ndoubt know.\"\n\n\"Verily, Senor Don Quixote,\" said Don Lorenzo, \"I wish I could catch your\nworship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through my\nfingers like an eel.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you say, or mean by slipping,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"I will explain myself another time,\" said Don Lorenzo; \"for the present\npray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss, which run thus:\n\nCould 'was' become an 'is' for me,\nThen would I ask no more than this;\nOr could, for me, the time that is\nBecome the time that is to be!--\n\nGLOSS\n\nDame Fortune once upon a day\n  To me was bountiful and kind;\n  But all things change; she changed her mind,\nAnd what she gave she took away.\nO Fortune, long I've sued to thee;\n  The gifts thou gavest me restore,\n  For, trust me, I would ask no more,\nCould 'was' become an 'is' for me.\n\nNo other prize I seek to gain,\n  No triumph, glory, or success,\n  Only the long-lost happiness,\nThe memory whereof is pain.\nOne taste, methinks, of bygone bliss\n  The heart-consuming fire might stay;\n  And, so it come without delay,\nThen would I ask no more than this.\n\nI ask what cannot be, alas!\n  That time should ever be, and then\n  Come back to us, and be again,\nNo power on earth can bring to pass;\nFor fleet of foot is he, I wis,\n  And idly, therefore, do we pray\n  That what for aye hath left us may\nBecome for us the time that is.\n\nPerplexed, uncertain, to remain\n  'Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life;\n  'Twere better, sure, to end the strife,\nAnd dying, seek release from pain.\nAnd yet, thought were the best for me.\n  Anon the thought aside I fling,\n  And to the present fondly cling,\nAnd dread the time that is to be.\"\n\nWhen Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up,\nand in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don\nLorenzo's right hand in his, \"By the highest heavens, noble youth, but\nyou are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel,\nnot by Cyprus or by Gaeta--as a certain poet, God forgive him, said--but\nby the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that\nflourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges who\nrob you of the first prize--that Phoebus may pierce them with his arrows,\nand the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat me some\nof your long-measure verses, senor, if you will be so good, for I want\nthoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.\"\n\nIs there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised\nby Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery,\nhow far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant\njurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with Don\nQuixote's request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet on the\nfable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.\n\nSONNET\n\nThe lovely maid, she pierces now the wall;\n  Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie;\n  And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,\nA chink to view so wondrous great and small.\nThere silence speaketh, for no voice at all\n  Can pass so strait a strait; but love will ply\n  Where to all other power 'twere vain to try;\nFor love will find a way whate'er befall.\nImpatient of delay, with reckless pace\n  The rash maid wins the fatal spot where she\nSinks not in lover's arms but death's embrace.\n  So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain\nOne sword, one sepulchre, one memory,\n  Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.\n\n\"Blessed be God,\" said Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo's\nsonnet, \"that among the hosts there are of irritable poets I have found\none consummate one, which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves to me\nthat you are!\"\n\nFor four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego's\nhouse, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart,\ntelling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had\nreceived in his house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to\ngive themselves up for long to idleness and luxury, he was anxious to\nfulfill the duties of his calling in seeking adventures, of which he was\ninformed there was an abundance in that neighbourhood, where he hoped to\nemploy his time until the day came round for the jousts at Saragossa, for\nthat was his proper destination; and that, first of all, he meant to\nenter the cave of Montesinos, of which so many marvellous things were\nreported all through the country, and at the same time to investigate and\nexplore the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the\nlakes of Ruidera.\n\nDon Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him\nfurnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as\nthey would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal\nworth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.\n\nThe day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it\nwas sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with\nthe abundance of Don Diego's house, and objected to return to the\nstarvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his\nill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he\nconsidered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \"I\nknow not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once\nmore, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the\ninaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to\nturn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still\nnarrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an\nemperor in the twinkling of an eye.\"\n\nIn this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but\nstill better in what he added when he said, \"God knows, I would gladly\ntake Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and\ntrample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the\nprofession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it,\nnor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself\nwith impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a\npoet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own;\nbecause no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured,\nand this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of\nthe children of the brain.\"\n\nBoth father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote\ntalked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity\nand persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of\nhis unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.\nThere was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with\nthe gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their\ndeparture, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho on Dapple.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nIN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD, TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS\n\n\nDon Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego's village,\nwhen he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a couple\nof peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of the students\ncarried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau,\nwhat seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of ribbed\nstockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of new fencing-foils with\nbuttons. The peasants carried divers articles that showed they were on\ntheir way from some large town where they had bought them, and were\ntaking them home to their village; and both students and peasants were\nstruck with the same amazement that everybody felt who saw Don Quixote\nfor the first time, and were dying to know who this man, so different\nfrom ordinary men, could be. Don Quixote saluted them, and after\nascertaining that their road was the same as his, made them an offer of\nhis company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young asses\ntravelled faster than his horse; and then, to gratify them, he told them\nin a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed,\nwhich was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of the\nworld. He informed them that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha,\nand that he was called, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.\n\nAll this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to the\nstudents, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote's pate; for\nall that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, and one\nof them said to him, \"If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, as it is\nthe way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let your worship\ncome with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddings that up\nto this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or for many a league\nround.\"\n\nDon Quixote asked him if it was some prince's, that he spoke of it in\nthis way. \"Not at all,\" said the student; \"it is the wedding of a farmer\nand a farmer's daughter, he the richest in all this country, and she the\nfairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it is to be\nattended will be something rare and out of the common, for it will be\ncelebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is called,\npar excellence, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is called Camacho\nthe rich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and they are fairly\nmatched, though some knowing ones, who have all the pedigrees in the\nworld by heart, will have it that the family of the fair Quiteria is\nbetter than Camacho's; but no one minds that now-a-days, for wealth can\nsolder a great many flaws. At any rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is\nhis fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in\noverhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to\nreach the grass that covers the soil. He has provided dancers too, not\nonly sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there are those who\nring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I\nsay nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none of these things,\nnor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to make\nthis a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing\nBasilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village as\nQuiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of\nwhich circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the\nlong-forgotten loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria\nfrom his earliest years, and she responded to his passion with countless\nmodest proofs of affection, so that the loves of the two children,\nBasilio and Quiteria, were the talk and the amusement of the town. As\nthey grew up, the father of Quiteria made up his mind to refuse Basilio\nhis wonted freedom of access to the house, and to relieve himself of\nconstant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a match for his daughter with\nthe rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying her to Basilio, who\nhad not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the\ntruth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty\nthrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he\nruns like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins\nas if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it\nspeak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best.\"\n\n\"For that excellence alone,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"the youth\ndeserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere\nherself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try\nto prevent it.\"\n\n\"Say that to my wife,\" said Sancho, who had until now listened in\nsilence, \"for she won't hear of anything but each one marrying his equal,\nholding with the proverb 'each ewe to her like.' What I would like is\nthat this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy to him\nalready) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good luck--I\nmeant to say the opposite--on people who would prevent those who love one\nanother from marrying.\"\n\n\"If all those who love one another were to marry,\" said Don Quixote, \"it\nwould deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to\nthe proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters\nto choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her\nfather's servant, and another, some one she has seen passing in the\nstreet and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully;\nfor love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted\nin choosing one's way of life; and the matrimonial choice is very liable\nto error, and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to\nmake it a good one. He who has to make a long journey, will, if he is\nwise, look out for some trusty and pleasant companion to accompany him\nbefore he sets out. Why, then, should not he do the same who has to make\nthe whole journey of life down to the final halting-place of death, more\nespecially when the companion has to be his companion in bed, at board,\nand everywhere, as the wife is to her husband? The companionship of one's\nwife is no article of merchandise, that, after it has been bought, may be\nreturned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparable accident that\nlasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once you put it round\nyour neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe of Death does\nnot cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great deal more on this\nsubject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to know if the senor\nlicentiate has anything more to tell about the story of Basilio.\"\n\nTo this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,\nreplied, \"I have nothing whatever to say further, but that from the\nmoment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to\nCamacho the rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter\nrational word, and he always goes about moody and dejected, talking to\nhimself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses. He eats\nlittle and sleeps little, and all he eats is fruit, and when he sleeps,\nif he sleeps at all, it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute\nbeast. Sometimes he gazes at the sky, at other times he fixes his eyes on\nthe earth in such an abstracted way that he might be taken for a clothed\nstatue, with its drapery stirred by the wind. In short, he shows such\nsigns of a heart crushed by suffering, that all we who know him believe\nthat when to-morrow the fair Quiteria says 'yes,' it will be his sentence\nof death.\"\n\n\"God will guide it better,\" said Sancho, \"for God who gives the wound\ngives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there are a good many\nhours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or any moment, the\nhouse may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sun shining all\nat one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who can't stir the\nnext day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of having driven a\nnail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between a woman's 'yes'\nand 'no' I wouldn't venture to put the point of a pin, for there would\nnot be room for it; if you tell me Quiteria loves Basilio heart and soul,\nthen I'll give him a bag of good luck; for love, I have heard say, looks\nthrough spectacles that make copper seem gold, poverty wealth, and bleary\neyes pearls.\"\n\n\"What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!\" said Don Quixote;\n\"for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayings together, no one\ncan understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he had thee. Tell me,\nthou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, or anything\nelse?\"\n\n\"Oh, if you don't understand me,\" replied Sancho, \"it is no wonder my\nwords are taken for nonsense; but no matter; I understand myself, and I\nknow I have not said anything very foolish in what I have said; only your\nworship, senor, is always gravelling at everything I say, nay, everything\nI do.\"\n\n\"Cavilling, not gravelling,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou prevaricator of\nhonest language, God confound thee!\"\n\n\"Don't find fault with me, your worship,\" returned Sancho, \"for you know\nI have not been bred up at court or trained at Salamanca, to know whether\nI am adding or dropping a letter or so in my words. Why! God bless me,\nit's not fair to force a Sayago-man to speak like a Toledan; maybe there\nare Toledans who do not hit it off when it comes to polished talk.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the licentiate, \"for those who have been bred up in\nthe Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those who are almost all\nday pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are all Toledans. Pure,\ncorrect, elegant and lucid language will be met with in men of courtly\nbreeding and discrimination, though they may have been born in\nMajalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many who are not\nso, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if it be\naccompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon law at\nSalamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear,\nplain, and intelligible language.\"\n\n\"If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with those foils\nyou carry than on dexterity of tongue,\" said the other student, \"you\nwould have been head of the degrees, where you are now tail.\"\n\n\"Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,\" returned the licentiate, \"you have the\nmost mistaken idea in the world about skill with the sword, if you think\nit useless.\"\n\n\"It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,\" replied Corchuelo;\n\"and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, you have swords\nthere, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand and a strong\narm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not small, will make\nyou confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and put in practice your\npositions and circles and angles and science, for I hope to make you see\nstars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship, in which, next to God, I\nplace my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turn my\nback, and that there is not one in the world I will not compel to give\nground.\"\n\n\"As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,\"\nreplied the master of fence; \"though it might be that your grave would be\ndug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; I mean that\nyou would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see,\" replied Corchuelo, and getting off his ass briskly,\nhe drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his\nbeast.\n\n\"It must not be that way,\" said Don Quixote at this point; \"I will be the\ndirector of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed\nquestion;\" and dismounting from Rocinante and grasping his lance, he\nplanted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with\nan easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards Corchuelo, who came\non against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. The other\ntwo of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their asses,\nserved as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts, thrusts, down\nstrokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo delivered were past\ncounting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked like an angry\nlion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of the\nlicentiate's sword that checked him in the midst of his furious onset,\nand made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutly as\nrelics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that the licentiate\nreckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of the short\ncassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails of a\ncuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him out,\nthat in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt and\nflung it away with such force, that one of the peasants that were there,\nwho was a notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit afterwards that\nhe sent it nearly three-quarters of a league, which testimony will serve,\nand has served, to show and establish with all certainty that strength is\novercome by skill.\n\nCorchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, \"By my\nfaith, senor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will never\nchallenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, for\nyou have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as\nthey call them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword\nthrough the eye of a needle.\"\n\n\"I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,\" said Corchuelo, \"and\nwith having had the truth I was so ignorant of proved to me by\nexperience;\" and getting up he embraced the licentiate, and they were\nbetter friends than ever; and not caring to wait for the notary who had\ngone for the sword, as they saw he would be a long time about it, they\nresolved to push on so as to reach the village of Quiteria, to which they\nall belonged, in good time.\n\nDuring the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them on\nthe excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and such\nfigures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the value of\nthe science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.\n\nIt grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as\nif there was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it.\nThey heard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments,\nflutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels, and as they drew\nnear they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had been\nconstructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights\nunaffected by the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it\nhad not power to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians were the\nlife of the wedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate\nbands, some dancing, others singing, others playing the various\ninstruments already mentioned. In short, it seemed as though mirth and\ngaiety were frisking and gambolling all over the meadow. Several other\npersons were engaged in erecting raised benches from which people might\nconveniently see the plays and dances that were to be performed the next\nday on the spot dedicated to the celebration of the marriage of Camacho\nthe rich and the obsequies of Basilio. Don Quixote would not enter the\nvillage, although the peasant as well as the bachelor pressed him; he\nexcused himself, however, on the grounds, amply sufficient in his\nopinion, that it was the custom of knights-errant to sleep in the fields\nand woods in preference to towns, even were it under gilded ceilings; and\nso turned aside a little out of the road, very much against Sancho's\nwill, as the good quarters he had enjoyed in the castle or house of Don\nDiego came back to his mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nWHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH, TOGETHER\nWITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR\n\n\nScarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phoebus time to dry the liquid\npearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when Don\nQuixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and called\nto his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don Quixote ere\nhe roused him thus addressed him: \"Happy thou, above all the dwellers on\nthe face of the earth, that, without envying or being envied, sleepest\nwith tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters persecute nor\nenchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say a hundred times,\nwithout any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless\nvigils, or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest, or\nfind to-morrow's food for thyself and thy needy little family, to\ninterfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thy rest, nor doth this\nworld's empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is\nto provide for thy ass, since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the\nsupport of thyself, the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom\nhave imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and the master lies awake\nthinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and reward him. The distress\nof seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from the\nearth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time of\nscarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of\nplenty and abundance.\"\n\nTo all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he have\nwakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him to his\nsenses with the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy and lazy, and\ncasting his eyes about in every direction, observed, \"There comes, if I\ndon't mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a\ngreat deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding\nthat begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and\nunstinting.\"\n\n\"Have done, thou glutton,\" said Don Quixote; \"come, let us go and witness\nthis bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.\"\n\n\"Let him do what he likes,\" returned Sancho; \"be he not poor, he would\nmarry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and he without a\nfarthing; is there nothing else? Faith, senor, it's my opinion the poor\nman should be content with what he can get, and not go looking for\ndainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that Camacho could\nbury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what a fool\nQuiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels Camacho must have\ngiven her and will give her, and take Basilio's bar-throwing and\nsword-play. They won't give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good cast\nof the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talents and accomplishments\nthat can't be turned into money, let Count Dirlos have them; but when\nsuch gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I wish my condition of life\nwas as becoming as they are. On a good foundation you can raise a good\nbuilding, and the best foundation in the world is money.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote here, \"stop that harangue; it\nis my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest every\ninstant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping; for thou\nwouldst spend it all in talking.\"\n\n\"If your worship had a good memory,\" replied Sancho, \"you would remember\nthe articles of our agreement before we started from home this last time;\none of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, so long as it was\nnot against my neighbour or your worship's authority; and so far, it\nseems to me, I have not broken the said article.\"\n\n\"I remember no such article, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even if it\nwere so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the\ninstruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the\nvalleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of\nthe morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.\"\n\nSancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante\nand the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace\nentered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to Sancho's\neyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at which\nit was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain of\nfaggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in\nthe ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, each\nfit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallowed up whole\nsheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of\nthem than if they were pigeons. Countless were the hares ready skinned\nand the plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots,\nnumberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from the\nbranches that the air might keep them cool. Sancho counted more than\nsixty wine skins of over six gallons each, and all filled, as it proved\nafterwards, with generous wines. There were, besides, piles of the\nwhitest bread, like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing-floors.\nThere was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two\ncauldrons full of oil, bigger than those of a dyer's shop, served for\ncooking fritters, which when fried were taken out with two mighty\nshovels, and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood\nclose by. Of cooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean,\nbrisk, and blithe. In the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft\nlittle sucking-pigs, which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness\nand flavour. The spices of different kinds did not seem to have been\nbought by the pound but by the quarter, and all lay open to view in a\ngreat chest. In short, all the preparations made for the wedding were in\nrustic style, but abundant enough to feed an army.\n\nSancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his heart. The\nfirst to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of which he\nwould have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the\nwine skins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the\nfrying-pans, if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called\nfrying-pans; and unable to control himself or bear it any longer, he\napproached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged\npermission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which the cook\nmade answer, \"Brother, this is not a day on which hunger is to have any\nsway, thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about for a ladle and\nskim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you.\"\n\n\"I don't see one,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" said the cook; \"sinner that I am! how particular and\nbashful you are!\" and so saying, he seized a bucket and plunging it into\none of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, and said\nto Sancho, \"Fall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetite with\nthese skimmings until dinner-time comes.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to put them in,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Well then,\" said the cook, \"take spoon and all; for Camacho's wealth and\nhappiness furnish everything.\"\n\nWhile Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one\nend of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala\ndress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field\ntrappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who,\nmarshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the\nmeadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of \"Long live Camacho and\nQuiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!\"\n\nHearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, \"It is easy to see these folk\nhave never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would be\nmore moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.\"\n\nShortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to\nenter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers\ncomposed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien,\nclad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs\nembroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the\nmares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been\nwounded. \"As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,\" said he, \"we are\nall safe and sound;\" and he at once began to execute complicated figures\nwith the rest of his comrades, with so many turns and so great dexterity,\nthat although Don Quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind,\nhe thought he had never seen any so good as this. He also admired another\nthat came in composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be\nunder fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff,\nwith their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such\nbright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands\nof jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head were a\nvenerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk and active, however,\nthan might have been expected from their years. The notes of a Zamora\nbagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in their countenances and in\ntheir eyes, and lightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in\nthe world.\n\nFollowing these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call\n\"speaking dances.\" It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the\ngod Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished with\nwings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and\nsilk of divers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their names\nwritten on white parchment in large letters on their backs. \"Poetry\" was\nthe name of the first, \"Wit\" of the second, \"Birth\" of the third, and\n\"Valour\" of the fourth. Those that followed Interest were distinguished\nin the same way; the badge of the first announced \"Liberality,\" that of\nthe second \"Largess,\" the third \"Treasure,\" and the fourth \"Peaceful\nPossession.\" In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four wild\nmen, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so natural that\nthey nearly terrified Sancho. On the front of the castle and on each of\nthe four sides of its frame it bore the inscription \"Castle of Caution.\"\nFour skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them, and the dance\nhaving been opened, Cupid, after executing two figures, raised his eyes\nand bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the\ncastle, and thus addressed her:\n\nI am the mighty God whose sway\n  Is potent over land and sea.\nThe heavens above us own me; nay,\n  The shades below acknowledge me.\nI know not fear, I have my will,\n  Whate'er my whim or fancy be;\nFor me there's no impossible,\n  I order, bind, forbid, set free.\n\nHaving concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the\ncastle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and went\nthrough two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:\n\nBut mightier than Love am I,\n  Though Love it be that leads me on,\nThan mine no lineage is more high,\n  Or older, underneath the sun.\nTo use me rightly few know how,\n  To act without me fewer still,\nFor I am Interest, and I vow\n  For evermore to do thy will.\n\nInterest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gone through\nher figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle,\nshe said:\n\nWith many a fanciful conceit,\n  Fair Lady, winsome Poesy\nHer soul, an offering at thy feet,\n  Presents in sonnets unto thee.\nIf thou my homage wilt not scorn,\n  Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes,\nOn wings of poesy upborne\n  Shall be exalted to the skies.\n\nPoetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, and\nafter having gone through her figures, said:\n\nTo give, while shunning each extreme,\n  The sparing hand, the over-free,\nTherein consists, so wise men deem,\n  The virtue Liberality.\nBut thee, fair lady, to enrich,\n  Myself a prodigal I'll prove,\nA vice not wholly shameful, which\n  May find its fair excuse in love.\n\nIn the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and\nretired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of\nthem graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote's memory (though he had an\nexcellent one) only carried away those that have been just quoted. All\nthen mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with\ngraceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of the\ncastle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pellets\nagainst it. At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest drew\nout a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all\nappearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with the force\nof the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down, leaving the damsel\nexposed and unprotected. Interest and the characters of his band\nadvanced, and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to\ntake her and lead her away captive, on seeing which, Love and his\nsupporters made as though they would release her, the whole action being\nto the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance.\nThe wild men made peace between them, and with great dexterity readjusted\nand fixed the boards of the castle, and the damsel once more ensconced\nherself within; and with this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment\nof the beholders.\n\nDon Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and\narranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a\nnice taste in devising things of the sort. \"I will lay a wager,\" said Don\nQuixote, \"that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of\nCamacho's than of Basilio's, and that he is better at satire than at\nvespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and the riches\nof Camacho very neatly into the dance.\" Sancho Panza, who was listening\nto all this, exclaimed, \"The king is my cock; I stick to Camacho.\" \"It is\neasy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and one of that\nsort that cry 'Long life to the conqueror.'\"\n\n\"I don't know of what sort I am,\" returned Sancho, \"but I know very well\nI'll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio's pots as these I have\ngot off Camacho's;\" and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens,\nand seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, \"A\nfig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast so much art\nthou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou. As a\ngrandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families in the\nworld, the Haves and the Haven'ts; and she stuck to the Haves; and to\nthis day, Senor Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of\n'Have,' than of 'Know;' an ass covered with gold looks better than a\nhorse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the\nbountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits;\nbut of Basilio's, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot, they'll be\nonly rinsings.\"\n\n\"Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote. \"Of course I\nhave finished it,\" replied Sancho, \"because I see your worship takes\noffence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cut out\nfor three days.\"\n\n\"God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"At the rate we are going,\" said Sancho, \"I'll be chewing clay before\nyour worship dies; and then, maybe, I'll be so dumb that I'll not say a\nword until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of judgment.\"\n\n\"Even should that happen, O Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thy silence will\nnever come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk all thy\nlife; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death will come\nbefore thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even when thou art\ndrinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.\"\n\n\"In good faith, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"there's no trusting that\nfleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep,\nand, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon the\nlofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady is more\nmighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all and is ready\nfor all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages, and\nranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times she is\nreaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she never\nseems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before her, for she\nhas a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has no\nbelly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of\nall that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.\"\n\n\"Say no more, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at this; \"don't try to better it,\nand risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy\nrustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee,\nSancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst\ntake a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.\"\n\"He preaches well who lives well,\" said Sancho, \"and I know no more\ntheology than that.\"\n\n\"Nor needst thou,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I cannot conceive or make out\nhow it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou, who\nart more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much.\"\n\n\"Pass judgment on your chivalries, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"and don't\nset yourself up to judge of other men's fears or braveries, for I am as\ngood a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these\nskimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to\naccount for in the other world;\" and so saying, he began a fresh attack\non the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused Don Quixote's,\nwho no doubt would have helped him had he not been prevented by what must\nbe told farther on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nIN WHICH CAMACHO'S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFUL INCIDENTS\n\n\nWhile Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the\nlast chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were\nuttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop,\nshouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with\nmusical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and\naccompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most\ndistinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the\nbride, he exclaimed, \"By my faith, she is not dressed like a country\ngirl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the\npatena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile\nvelvet; and then the white linen trimming--by my oath, but it's satin!\nLook at her hands--jet rings on them! May I never have luck if they're\nnot gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled\nmilk, and every one of them worth an eye of one's head! Whoreson baggage,\nwhat hair she has! if it's not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all\nthe days of my life. See how bravely she bears herself--and her shape!\nWouldn't you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of\ndates? for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just\nlike them. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit 'to pass over\nthe banks of Flanders.'\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed at Sancho's boorish eulogies and thought that, saving\nhis lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman.\nThe fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of\nthe bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their\nwedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on one\nside of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to\nplight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and\nplays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud\noutcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, \"Wait a little, ye, as\ninconsiderate as ye are hasty!\" At these words all turned round, and\nperceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose\nblack coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (as\nwas presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he\nheld a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as the\ngay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his\nwords, in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at\nsuch a moment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting\nhimself in front of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel\nspike at the end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed\non Quiteria, he thus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice:\n\n\"Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy law\nwe acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art thou\nignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions would\nimprove my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due to\nthy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love,\nwouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring\nhim not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete it\n(not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to\nbestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle\nthat may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long live\nthe rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful\nQuiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped the\nwings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!\"\n\nAnd so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and\nleaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that\nconcealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being\nplanted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself\nupon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade\nappeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his\nblood, and transfixed by his own weapon.\n\nHis friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and\nsad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to\nsupport him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to\nbreathe. They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was\nstanding by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him,\nas the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio,\nhowever, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, \"If\nthou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in\nthis last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find\npardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.\"\n\nHearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather\nthan of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God's\npardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio replied\nthat he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him her\nhand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him\ncourage to make his confession.\n\nDon Quixote hearing the wounded man's entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what\nBasilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might\nbe easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Senor Camacho's\nhonour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as\nif he received her direct from her father.\n\n\"In this case,\" said he, \"it will be only to say 'yes,' and no\nconsequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch\nof this marriage must be the grave.\"\n\nCamacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not\nknowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio's\nfriends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that\nhis soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they\nmoved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it\nhe was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his\nwishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some\nwith prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive\narguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble\nand more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a\nword, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her\ndecide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his\nteeth, and there was no time for hesitation.\n\nOn this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and\nrepentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already\nturned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name\nof Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen\nand not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded\nhis hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing\nfixedly at her, said, \"O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at\na moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life,\nfor I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou\ngivest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is\nrapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of\nthee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and\nwouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me\nafresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint\nupon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is\nnot meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or\nhave recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.\"\n\nWhile uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders\nexpected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then\nQuiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the\nhand of Basilio, said, \"No force would bend my will; as freely,\ntherefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a\nlawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free\nwill, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought\nupon thee.\"\n\n\"Yes, I give it,\" said Basilio, \"not agitated or distracted, but with\nunclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give\nmyself to be thy husband.\"\n\n\"And I give myself to be thy wife,\" said Quiteria, \"whether thou livest\nmany years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.\"\n\n\"For one so badly wounded,\" observed Sancho at this point, \"this young\nman has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and\ncooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on his\ntongue than at his teeth.\"\n\nBasilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved\nand with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and\nimplored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded\nman, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his\nfeet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been\nsheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and some, more\nsimple than inquiring, began shouting, \"A miracle, a miracle!\" But\nBasilio replied, \"No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!\" The\npriest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound with both\nhands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio's flesh\nand ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he had\nadroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained,\nhaving been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the priest and\nCamacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools\nof. The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on the\ncontrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not\nbe valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all\nconcluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding\nbetween the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters were so mortified\nthat they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number\nof them drawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as\nmany more swords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking\nthe lead on horseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with\nhis shield, made all give way before him. Sancho, who never found any\npleasure or enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from\nwhich he had taken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy\nplace, that spot would be respected.\n\n\"Hold, sirs, hold!\" cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; \"we have no right\nto take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember love and\nwar are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and common to make\nuse of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in the contests and\nrivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired\nend are justifiable, provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour\nof the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilio and Basilio to Quiteria\nby the just and beneficent disposal of heaven. Camacho is rich, and can\npurchase his pleasure when, where, and as it pleases him. Basilio has but\nthis ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful he may be, shall take her\nfrom him; these two whom God hath joined man cannot separate; and he who\nattempts it must first pass the point of this lance;\" and so saying he\nbrandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not\nknow him.\n\nBut so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho's\nmind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels\nof the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with\nhim, and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and\ntranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing\nagainst the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio;\nCamacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for\nBasilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman, and that he\nought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given\nher.\n\nCamacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and\npacified, those on Basilio's side were appeased; and the rich Camacho, to\nshow that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care about it,\ndesired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality.\nNeither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers would take\nany part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio's village; for the poor, if\nthey are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour,\nand uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance\nattendance on them. With them they carried Don Quixote, regarding him as\na man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone had a cloud on his soul, for\nhe found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho's splendid feast and\nfestival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged away, he moodily\nfollowed his master, who accompanied Basilio's party, and left behind him\nthe flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his heart he took them with him, and\ntheir now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in the bucket\nconjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the\ngood cheer he was losing. And so, vexed and dejected though not hungry,\nwithout dismounting from Dapple he followed in the footsteps of\nRocinante.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nWHERIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THE\nHEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY\nTERMINATION\n\n\nMany and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newly\nmarried couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming\nforward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the\nsame level with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero in\neloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of\nthe pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme\narranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio's, who counted\non exactly the result they had seen; he confessed, it is true, that he\nhad confided his idea to some of his friends, so that at the proper time\nthey might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the\ndeception.\n\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"is not and ought not to be called deception\nwhich aims at virtuous ends;\" and the marriage of lovers he maintained to\nbe a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no\ngreater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety,\nenjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the possession\nof the object of his love, and poverty and want are the declared enemies\nof all these; which he said to urge Senor Basilio to abandon the practice\nof those accomplishments he was skilled in, for though they brought him\nfame, they brought him no money, and apply himself to the acquisition of\nwealth by legitimate industry, which will never fail those who are\nprudent and persevering. The poor man who is a man of honour (if indeed a\npoor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel when he has a fair wife, and\nif she is taken from him, his honour is taken from him and slain. The\nfair woman who is a woman of honour, and whose husband is poor, deserves\nto be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph. Beauty\nby itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royal eagles\nand birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if\nbeauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites\nand other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against such\nattacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband. \"Remember, O\nprudent Basilio,\" added Don Quixote, \"it was the opinion of a certain\nsage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one good woman in the\nwhole world; and his advice was that each one should think and believe\nthat this one good woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live\nhappy. I myself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my\nthoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone\nwho might ask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as\nhe would be content to marry. The first thing I would recommend him,\nwould be to look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman\ndoes not win a good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seen\nthat she is so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a\nwoman's honour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into your\nhouse it will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make her\nstill better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to\nmend her, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to\nanother. I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.\"\n\nSancho, listening to all this, said to himself, \"This master of mine,\nwhen I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take a\npulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I say\nof him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving advice\nnot only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger, and go\ninto the market-places to his heart's content. Devil take you for a\nknight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in my heart\nthat the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry; but there\nis nothing he won't have a finger in.\"\n\nSancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, and\nasked, \"What art thou muttering there, Sancho?\"\n\n\"I'm not saying anything or muttering anything,\" said Sancho; \"I was only\nsaying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship has said just\nnow before I married; perhaps I'd say now, 'The ox that's loose licks\nhimself well.'\"\n\n\"Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?\"\n\n\"She is not very bad,\" replied Sancho; \"but she is not very good; at\nleast she is not as good as I could wish.\"\n\n\"Thou dost wrong, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"to speak ill of thy wife;\nfor after all she is the mother of thy children.\" \"We are quits,\"\nreturned Sancho; \"for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into her\nhead, especially when she is jealous; and Satan himself could not put up\nwith her then.\"\n\nIn fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whom\nthey were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged the\nfencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of\nMontesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own\neyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country\nwere true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a\nfamous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who\nwould have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very\ncave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous\nall over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would\nfind him entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good\nenough to be printed and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at\nlast, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a\nparti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple\nready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which went those of the\ncousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to God and\nbidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous\ncave of Montesinos.\n\nOn the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his\npursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was\nby profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making\nbooks for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to\nthe nation. One was called \"The Book of Liveries,\" in which he described\nseven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes, and\nciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any they\nfancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging for them\nfrom anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have them\nappropriate to their objects and purposes; \"for,\" said he, \"I give the\njealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what will suit them,\nand fit them without fail. I have another book, too, which I shall call\n'Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,' one of rare and original invention,\nfor imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show in it who the Giralda of\nSeville and the Angel of the Magdalena were, what the sewer of\nVecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of Guisando, the Sierra\nMorena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at Madrid, not forgetting\nthose of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of the Priora; and all with\ntheir allegories, metaphors, and changes, so that they are amusing,\ninteresting, and instructive, all at once. Another book I have which I\ncall 'The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,' which treats of the invention\nof things, and is a work of great erudition and research, for I establish\nand elucidate elegantly some things of great importance which Polydore\nomitted to mention. He forgot to tell us who was the first man in the\nworld that had a cold in his head, and who was the first to try\nsalivation for the French disease, but I give it accurately set forth,\nand quote more than five-and-twenty authors in proof of it, so you may\nperceive I have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be of\nservice to the whole world.\"\n\nSancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin's words, said to him,\n\"Tell me, senor--and God give you luck in printing your books-can you\ntell me (for of course you know, as you know everything) who was the\nfirst man that scratched his head? For to my thinking it must have been\nour father Adam.\"\n\n\"So it must,\" replied the cousin; \"for there is no doubt but Adam had a\nhead and hair; and being the first man in the world he would have\nscratched himself sometimes.\"\n\n\"So I think,\" said Sancho; \"but now tell me, who was the first tumbler in\nthe world?\"\n\n\"Really, brother,\" answered the cousin, \"I could not at this moment say\npositively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go\nback to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we\nmeet, for this will not be the last time.\"\n\n\"Look here, senor,\" said Sancho, \"don't give yourself any trouble about\nit, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The first\ntumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or\npitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless pit.\"\n\n\"You are right, friend,\" said the cousin; and said Don Quixote, \"Sancho,\nthat question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard them from\nsome one else.\"\n\n\"Hold your peace, senor,\" said Sancho; \"faith, if I take to asking\nquestions and answering, I'll go on from this till to-morrow morning.\nNay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn't go looking for\nhelp from my neighbours.\"\n\n\"Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote;\n\"for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving\nthings that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to\nthe understanding or memory.\"\n\nIn this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night\nthey put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to\nthe cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if\nhe was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide\nhimself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.\nDon Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant\nto see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope,\nand next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth\nof which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes and\nbrambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it up\nand cover it over.\n\nOn coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote\ndismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly\nwith the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said to\nhim, \"Mind what you are about, master mine; don't go burying yourself\nalive, or putting yourself where you'll be like a bottle put to cool in a\nwell; it's no affair or business of your worship's to become the explorer\nof this, which must be worse than a Moorish dungeon.\"\n\n\"Tie me and hold thy peace,\" said Don Quixote, \"for an emprise like this,\nfriend Sancho, was reserved for me;\" and said the guide, \"I beg of you,\nSenor Don Quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a hundred eyes\neverything that is within there; perhaps there may be some things for me\nto put into my book of 'Transformations.'\"\n\n\"The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,\" said\nSancho Panza.\n\nWhen he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the\narmour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, \"It was careless\nof us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell to be tied\non the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that I was still\ndescending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in God's\nhand be it to guide me;\" and forthwith he fell on his knees and in a low\nvoice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God to aid him and grant\nhim success in this to all appearance perilous and untried adventure, and\nthen exclaimed aloud, \"O mistress of my actions and movements,\nillustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be the prayers and\nsupplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears, by thy\nincomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for they but ask\nthee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I stand in such\nneed of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself into\nthe abyss that is here before me, only to let the world know that while\nthou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt and\naccomplish.\" With these words he approached the cavern, and perceived\nthat it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance except\nby sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his sword he began to\ndemolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at the noise\nof which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so thick\nand so fast that they knocked Don Quixote down; and if he had been as\nmuch of a believer in augury as he was a Catholic Christian he would have\ntaken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place. He\ngot up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds like the\nbats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho\ngiving him rope, he lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern;\nand as he entered it Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a\nthousand crosses over him and saying, \"God, and the Pena de Francia, and\nthe Trinity of Gaeta guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant.\nThere thou goest, thou dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of\nbrass; once more, God guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and\nunhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the\ndarkness thou art seeking there;\" and the cousin offered up almost the\nsame prayers and supplications.\n\nDon Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and they\ngave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out\nof the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down the\nhundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull Don Quixote up again,\nas they could give him no more rope; however, they waited about half an\nhour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again\nwith great ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy Don\nQuixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, Sancho wept\nbitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question.\nWhen, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty\nfathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at\nlast, at ten fathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho\ncalled out to him, saying, \"Welcome back, senor, for we had begun to\nthink you were going to stop there to found a family.\" But Don Quixote\nanswered not a word, and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had\nhis eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.\n\nThey stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did not\nawake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled\nhim about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching himself\njust as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking\nabout him he said, \"God forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from\nthe sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human\nbeing enjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all the pleasures of\nthis life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of\nthe field. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded Durandarte! O unhappy\nBelerma! O tearful Guadiana, and ye O hapless daughters of Ruidera who\nshow in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!\"\n\nThe cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the words of\nDon Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up\nfrom his very bowels. They begged of him to explain himself, and tell\nthem what he had seen in that hell down there.\n\n\"Hell do you call it?\" said Don Quixote; \"call it by no such name, for it\ndoes not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.\"\n\nHe then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very hungry.\nThey spread the cousin's sackcloth on the grass, and put the stores of\nthe alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting down lovingly and\nsociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in one; and when\nthe sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said, \"Let no one\nrise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nOF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THE INCOMPARABLE DON QUIXOTE SAID HE SAW IN THE\nPROFOUND CAVE OF MONTESINOS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICH\nCAUSE THIS ADVENTURE TO BE DEEMED APOCRYPHAL\n\n\nIt was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with\nsubdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate, without\nheat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos to his\ntwo illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:\n\n\"A matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man's height down in this\npit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy enough to\ncontain a large cart with its mules. A little light reaches it through\nsome chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to the surface of\nthe earth. This recess or space I perceived when I was already growing\nweary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope,\ntravelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or\nknowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myself\nfor a while. I called out, telling you not to let out more rope until I\nbade you, but you cannot have heard me. I then gathered in the rope you\nwere sending me, and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it,\nruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the\nbottom, having no one to hold me up; and as I was thus deep in thought\nand perplexity, suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell\nupon me, and when I least expected it, I know not how, I awoke and found\nmyself in the midst of the most beautiful, delightful meadow that nature\ncould produce or the most lively human imagination conceive. I opened my\neyes, I rubbed them, and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake.\nNevertheless, I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was\nI myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom; but touch,\nfeeling, the collected thoughts that passed through my mind, all\nconvinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment.\nNext there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle,\nwith walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal; and through\ntwo great doors that opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and\nadvancing towards me a venerable old man, clad in a long gown of\nmulberry-coloured serge that trailed upon the ground. On his shoulders\nand breast he had a green satin collegiate hood, and covering his head a\nblack Milanese bonnet, and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He\ncarried no arms whatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than\nfair-sized filberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg;\nhis bearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me\nspellbound and wondering. He approached me, and the first thing he did\nwas to embrace me closely, and then he said to me, 'For a long time now,\nO valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, we who are here enchanted in\nthese solitudes have been hoping to see thee, that thou mayest make known\nto the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave, called the\ncave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an achievement reserved for\nthy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt. Come with\nme, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the marvels hidden within this\ntransparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide and perpetual warden; for I\nam Montesinos himself, from whom the cave takes its name.'\n\n\"The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the story they\ntold in the world above here was true, that he had taken out the heart of\nhis great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little dagger, and\ncarried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the point of death\nhad commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the truth in every\nrespect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, nor little, but\na burnished poniard sharper than an awl.\"\n\n\"That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,\" said\nSancho.\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Don Quixote; \"it could not have been by that\nponiard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of yesterday,\nand the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was long ago;\nbut the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect or make\nany alteration in the truth or substance of the story.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the cousin; \"continue, Senor Don Quixote, for I am\nlistening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world.\"\n\n\"And with no less do I tell the tale,\" said Don Quixote; \"and so, to\nproceed--the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal,\nwhere, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster, was\nan elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretched at\nfull length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as are seen\non other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand (which\nseemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength in its\nowner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put any question\nto Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement, said to me,\n'This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of the true lovers and\nvaliant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here, as I myself and\nmany others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who, they say, was the\ndevil's son; but my belief is, not that he was the devil's son, but that\nhe knew, as the saying is, a point more than the devil. How or why he\nenchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell, and I suspect that time\nis not far off. What I marvel at is, that I know it to be as sure as that\nit is now day, that Durandarte ended his life in my arms, and that, after\nhis death, I took out his heart with my own hands; and indeed it must\nhave weighed more than two pounds, for, according to naturalists, he who\nhas a large heart is more largely endowed with valour than he who has a\nsmall one. Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die,\nhow comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he were\nstill alive?'\n\n\"As he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:\n\nO cousin Montesinos!\n  'T was my last request of thee,\nWhen my soul hath left the body,\n  And that lying dead I be,\nWith thy poniard or thy dagger\n  Cut the heart from out my breast,\nAnd bear it to Belerma.\n  This was my last request.\"\n\nOn hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees before the\nunhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, 'Long since, Senor\nDurandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade me on\nthat sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as I could,\nnot leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lace\nhandkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laid\nyou in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my\nhands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels;\nand more by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to\nafter leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to\nkeep it sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into the\npresence of the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself, Guadiana\nyour squire, the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters and two nieces,\nand many more of your friends and acquaintances, the sage Merlin has been\nkeeping enchanted here these many years; and although more than five\nhundred have gone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera and her daughters\nand nieces alone are missing, and these, because of the tears they shed,\nMerlin, out of the compassion he seems to have felt for them, changed\ninto so many lakes, which to this day in the world of the living, and in\nthe province of La Mancha, are called the Lakes of Ruidera. The seven\ndaughters belong to the kings of Spain and the two nieces to the knights\nof a very holy order called the Order of St. John. Guadiana your squire,\nlikewise bewailing your fate, was changed into a river of his own name,\nbut when he came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven, so\ngreat was his grief at finding he was leaving you, that he plunged into\nthe bowels of the earth; however, as he cannot help following his natural\ncourse, he from time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and\nthe world. The lakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and\nothers that come to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into\nPortugal; but for all that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and\nsadness, and takes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse\nand tasteless sorts, very different from those of the golden Tagus. All\nthis that I tell you now, O cousin mine, I have told you many times\nbefore, and as you make no answer, I fear that either you believe me not,\nor do not hear me, whereat I feel God knows what grief. I have now news\nto give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings, will\nnot in any wise increase them. Know that you have here before you (open\nyour eyes and you will see) that great knight of whom the sage Merlin has\nprophesied such great things; that Don Quixote of La Mancha I mean, who\nhas again, and to better purpose than in past times, revived in these\ndays knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and by whose intervention and\naid it may be we shall be disenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for\ngreat men.'\n\n\"'And if that may not be,' said the wretched Durandarte in a low and\nfeeble voice, 'if that may not be, then, my cousin, I say \"patience and\nshuffle;\"' and turning over on his side, he relapsed into his former\nsilence without uttering another word.\n\n\"And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied by\ndeep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystal wall\nI saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of fair\ndamsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish fashion\non their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady, for so\nfrom her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black, with a white veil\nso long and ample that it swept the ground. Her turban was twice as large\nas the largest of any of the others; her eyebrows met, her nose was\nrather flat, her mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her teeth, of\nwhich at times she allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set,\nthough as white as peeled almonds. She carried in her hands a fine cloth,\nand in it, as well as I could make out, a heart that had been mummied, so\nparched and dried was it. Montesinos told me that all those forming the\nprocession were the attendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were\nenchanted there with their master and mistress, and that the last, she\nwho carried the heart in the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her\ndamsels, four days in the week went in procession singing, or rather\nweeping, dirges over the body and miserable heart of his cousin; and that\nif she appeared to me somewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame\nreported her, it was because of the bad nights and worse days that she\npassed in that enchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles\nround her eyes, and her sickly complexion; 'her sallowness, and the rings\nround her eyes,' said he, 'are not caused by the periodical ailment usual\nwith women, for it is many months and even years since she has had any,\nbut by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in\nher hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memory the\nsad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the great\nDulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and even in the\nworld, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.'\n\n\"'Hold hard!' said I at this, 'tell your story as you ought, Senor Don\nMontesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and\nthere is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless\nDulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Dona Belerma is what she\nis and has been, and that's enough.' To which he made answer, 'Forgive\nme, Senor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke unadvisedly in saying\nthat the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady Belerma; for it\nwere enough for me to have learned, by what means I know not, that you\nare her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before I compared her to\nanything save heaven itself.' After this apology which the great\nMontesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock I had\nreceived in hearing my lady compared with Belerma.\"\n\n\"Still I wonder,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship did not get upon the\nold fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, and pluck his beard\nuntil you didn't leave a hair in it.\"\n\n\"Nay, Sancho, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"it would not have been right\nin me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to the aged, even\nthough they be not knights, but especially to those who are, and who are\nenchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he brought in the many other\nquestions and answers we exchanged.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand, Senor Don Quixote,\" remarked the cousin here, \"how\nit is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you have been\nbelow there, could have seen so many things, and said and answered so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"How long is it since I went down?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"Little better than an hour,\" replied Sancho.\n\n\"That cannot be,\" returned Don Quixote, \"because night overtook me while\nI was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three\ntimes; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those remote\nregions beyond our ken.\"\n\n\"My master must be right,\" replied Sancho; \"for as everything that has\nhappened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would\nseem three days and nights there.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"And did your worship eat anything all that time, senor?\" asked the\ncousin.\n\n\"I never touched a morsel,\" answered Don Quixote, \"nor did I feel hunger,\nor think of it.\"\n\n\"And do the enchanted eat?\" said the cousin.\n\n\"They neither eat,\" said Don Quixote; \"nor are they subject to the\ngreater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and\nhair grow.\"\n\n\"And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?\" asked Sancho.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied Don Quixote; \"at least, during those three days\nI was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.\"\n\n\"The proverb, 'Tell me what company thou keepest and I'll tell thee what\nthou art,' is to the point here,\" said Sancho; \"your worship keeps\ncompany with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what\nwonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with\nthem? But forgive me, senor, if I say that of all this you have told us\nnow, may God take me--I was just going to say the devil--if I believe a\nsingle particle.\"\n\n\"What!\" said the cousin, \"has Senor Don Quixote, then, been lying? Why,\neven if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together such\na host of lies.\"\n\n\"I don't believe my master lies,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"If not, what dost thou believe?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"I believe,\" replied Sancho, \"that this Merlin, or those enchanters who\nenchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with\ndown there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole\nyou have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.\"\n\n\"All that might be, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but it is not so, for\neverything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched with\nmy own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now how, among the\ncountless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at\nleisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the course\nof our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed me\nthree country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the\npleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be the\npeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls\nthat were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! I\nasked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he\nthought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was\nonly a few days before that they had made their appearance in those\nmeadows; but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a\ngreat many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in\nvarious strange shapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere\nand her dame Quintanona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he\ncame from Britain.\"\n\nWhen Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of\nhis senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about\nthe pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been the\nenchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last\nthat, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so\nhe said to him, \"It was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful\nday, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world,\nand an unlucky moment when you met with Senor Montesinos, who has sent\nyou back to us like this. You were well enough here above in your full\nsenses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and giving advice at\nevery turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatest nonsense that\ncan be imagined.\"\n\n\"As I know thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"I heed not thy words.\"\n\n\"Nor I your worship's,\" said Sancho, \"whether you beat me or kill me for\nthose I have spoken, and will speak if you don't correct and mend your\nown. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what did you\nrecognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what did you\nsay, and what did she answer?\"\n\n\"I recognised her,\" said Don Quixote, \"by her wearing the same garments\nshe wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to her, but she did\nnot utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned her back on me and\ntook to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have\novertaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had not\nMontesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless,\nparticularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for\nme to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in course of time he\nwould let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte, and all who were\nthere, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and observed down there,\nwhat gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos was speaking to me, one\nof the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me on one\nwithout my having seen her coming, and with tears in her eyes said to me,\nin a low, agitated voice, 'My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kisses your\nworship's hands, and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her\nknow how you are; and, being in great need, she also entreats your\nworship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen\nreals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity petticoat\nthat I have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.' I was\namazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to Senor Montesinos\nI asked him, 'Is it possible, Senor Montesinos, that persons of\ndistinction under enchantment can be in need?' To which he replied,\n'Believe me, Senor Don Quixote, that which is called need is to be met\nwith everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone, and\ndoes not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso\nsends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all appearance a good\none, there is nothing for it but to give them to her, for no doubt she\nmust be in some great strait.' 'I will take no pledge of her,' I replied,\n'nor yet can I give her what she asks, for all I have is four reals;\nwhich I gave (they were those which thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day\nto bestow in alms upon the poor I met along the road), and I said, 'Tell\nyour mistress, my dear, that I am grieved to the heart because of her\ndistresses, and wish I was a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have\nher know that I cannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of\nthe happiness of seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation, and\nthat I implore her as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen and\naddressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight. Tell her, too,\nthat when she least expects it she will hear it announced that I have\nmade an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis of\nMantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin, when he found him at the point\nof death in the heart of the mountains, which was, not to eat bread off a\ntablecloth, and other trifling matters which he added, until he had\navenged him; and I will make the same to take no rest, and to roam the\nseven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of\nPortugal ever roamed them, until I have disenchanted her.' 'All that and\nmore, you owe my lady,' the damsel's answer to me, and taking the four\nreals, instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper, springing two full\nyards into the air.\"\n\n\"O blessed God!\" exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, \"is it possible that\nsuch things can be in the world, and that enchanters and enchantments can\nhave such power in it as to have changed my master's right senses into a\ncraze so full of absurdity! O senor, senor, for God's sake, consider\nyourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit to this silly\nstuff that has left you scant and short of wits.\"\n\n\"Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"and not being experienced in the things of the world,\neverything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible;\nbut time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of the\nthings I saw down there which will make thee believe what I have related\nnow, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nWHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL AS THEY ARE\nNECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORY\n\n\nHe who translated this great history from the original written by its\nfirst author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter\ngiving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on the\nmargin of it, in Hamete's own hand, these exact words:\n\n\"I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in\nthe preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant Don\nQuixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have occurred\nup to the present have been possible and probable; but as for this one of\nthe cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it passes all\nreasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote could lie, he being\nthe most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time, is\nimpossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death\nwith arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and told the\nstory with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in so\nshort a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities;\nif, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and\nso, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down. Decide\nfor thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my\npower, to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his\ndeath he retracted, and said he had invented it, thinking it matched and\ntallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories.\" And then he\ngoes on to say:\n\nThe cousin was amazed as well at Sancho's boldness as at the patience of\nhis master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose\nfrom the happiness he felt at having seen his lady Dulcinea, even\nenchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language Sancho had\naddressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to him to\nhave been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed, \"I,\nSenor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent in\ntravelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gained\nfour things in the course of it; the first is that I have made your\nacquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I\nhave learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the\ntransformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be of\nuse to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to have\ndiscovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in the\ntime of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarte\nuttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talking\nto him, he woke up and said, 'Patience and shuffle.' This phrase and\nexpression he could not have learned while he was enchanted, but only\nbefore he had become so, in France, and in the time of the aforesaid\nemperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thing for me for\nthat other book I am writing, the 'Supplement to Polydore Vergil on the\nInvention of Antiquities;' for I believe he never thought of inserting\nthat of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine, and it will be a\nmatter of great importance, particularly when I can cite so grave and\nveracious an authority as Senor Durandarte. And the fourth thing is, that\nI have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana, heretofore unknown\nto mankind.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I should like to know, if by\nGod's favour they grant you a licence to print those books of yours-which\nI doubt--to whom do you mean to dedicate them?\"\n\n\"There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,\"\nsaid the cousin.\n\n\"Not many,\" said Don Quixote; \"not that they are unworthy of it, but\nbecause they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of\nmaking the return that seems due to the author's labour and courtesy. One\nprince I know who makes up for all the rest, and more-how much more, if I\nventured to say, perhaps I should stir up envy in many a noble breast;\nbut let this stand over for some more convenient time, and let us go and\nlook for some place to shelter ourselves in to-night.\"\n\n\"Not far from this,\" said the cousin, \"there is a hermitage, where there\nlives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has the reputation of\nbeing a good Christian and a very intelligent and charitable man. Close\nto the hermitage he has a small house which he built at his own cost, but\nthough small it is large enough for the reception of guests.\"\n\n\"Has this hermit any hens, do you think?\" asked Sancho.\n\n\"Few hermits are without them,\" said Don Quixote; \"for those we see\nnow-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts who were clad\nin palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But do not think\nthat by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean to say is\nthat the penances of those of the present day do not come up to the\nasceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow from\nthis that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and at the\nworst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open\nsinner.\"\n\nAt this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on\nfoot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances\nand halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on\nwithout stopping. Don Quixote called to him, \"Stay, good fellow; you seem\nto be making more haste than suits that mule.\"\n\n\"I cannot stop, senor,\" answered the man; \"for the arms you see I carry\nhere are to be used tomorrow, so I must not delay; God be with you. But\nif you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to lodge to-night\nat the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going the same\nroad you will find me there, and I will tell you some curious things;\nonce more God be with you;\" and he urged on his mule at such a pace that\nDon Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things were that he\nmeant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive, and always\ntortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decided to set out at\nonce, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the\nhermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt. Accordingly they\nmounted and all three took the direct road for the inn, which they\nreached a little before nightfall. On the road the cousin proposed they\nshould go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The instant Sancho heard\nthis he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don Quixote and the cousin did\nthe same; but it seems Sancho's bad luck so ordered it that the hermit\nwas not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in the hermitage told\nthem. They called for some of the best. She replied that her master had\nnone, but that if they liked cheap water she would give it with great\npleasure.\n\n\"If I found any in water,\" said Sancho, \"there are wells along the road\nwhere I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho's wedding, and plentiful\nhouse of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!\"\n\nLeaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little\nfarther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at\nno great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over his\nshoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,\nprobably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two;\nfor he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in\nplaces, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his shoes\nsquare-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been eighteen\nor nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of an\nactive habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the\nwearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was just finishing\none, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus--\n\nI'm off to the wars\n  For the want of pence,\nOh, had I but money\n  I'd show more sense.\n\nThe first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, \"You travel very\nairily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure to\ntell us?\"\n\nTo which the youth replied, \"The heat and my poverty are the reason of my\ntravelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.\"\n\n\"How poverty?\" asked Don Quixote; \"the heat one can understand.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied the youth, \"in this bundle I carry velvet pantaloons to\nmatch this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not be able to\nmake a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have not the\nwherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as to keep\nmyself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some\ncompanies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall\nenlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with after\nthat to the place of embarkation, which they say will be Carthagena; I\nwould rather have the King for a master, and serve him in the wars, than\nserve a court pauper.\"\n\n\"And did you get any bounty, now?\" asked the cousin.\n\n\"If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage of\ndistinction,\" replied the youth, \"I should have been safe to get it; for\nthat is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the servants'\nhall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good pension. But I,\nto my misfortune, always served place-hunters and adventurers, whose keep\nand wages were so miserable and scanty that half went in paying for the\nstarching of one's collars; it would be a miracle indeed if a page\nvolunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty.\"\n\n\"And tell me, for heaven's sake,\" asked Don Quixote, \"is it possible, my\nfriend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?\"\n\n\"They gave me two,\" replied the page; \"but just as when one quits a\nreligious community before making profession, they strip him of the dress\nof the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my masters return\nme mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court was\nfinished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely\nfor show.\"\n\n\"What spilorceria!--as an Italian would say,\" said Don Quixote; \"but for\nall that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an\nobject as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or\nprofitable than serving, first of all God, and then one's king and\nnatural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not\nmore wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as I have\nsaid many a time; for though letters may have founded more great houses\nthan arms, still those founded by arms have I know not what superiority\nover those founded by letters, and a certain splendour belonging to them\nthat distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind what I am now about\nto say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of\ntrouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adverse chances that\nmay befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be a good death,\nthe best of all is to die. They asked Julius Caesar, the valiant Roman\nemperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which is unexpected,\nwhich comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answered like a pagan,\nand one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far as sparing our\nfeelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you are killed in the\nfirst engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or blown up by\nmine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; and according\nto Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive and safe in\nflight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to\nhis captains and those in command over him. And remember, my son, that it\nis better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that\nif old age should come upon you in this honourable calling, though you\nmay be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon\nyou without honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially\nnow that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and\ndisabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the\nfashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they\nare old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under the\npretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which they\ncannot expect to be released except by death. But for the present I won't\nsay more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as the inn, and sup\nwith me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your journey, and God give\nyou as good speed as your intentions deserve.\"\n\nThe page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that to\nsupper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, \"God be with\nyou for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so many\nand so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw the impossible\nabsurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well, well, we shall\nsee.\"\n\nAnd now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was not\nwithout satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for a real\ninn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered Don Quixote\nasked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was\ntold that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what Sancho\nand the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger\nand the best place in the stable to Rocinante.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nWHEREIN IS SET DOWN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, AND THE DROLL ONE OF THE\nPUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHER WITH THE MEMORABLE DIVINATIONS OF THE DIVINING\nAPE\n\n\nDon Quixote's bread would not bake, as the common saying is, until he had\nheard and learned the curious things promised by the man who carried the\narms. He went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was and having\nfound him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to say in answer to\nthe question he had asked him on the road. \"The tale of my wonders must\nbe taken more leisurely and not standing,\" said the man; \"let me finish\nfoddering my beast, good sir; and then I'll tell you things that will\nastonish you.\"\n\n\"Don't wait for that,\" said Don Quixote; \"I'll help you in everything,\"\nand so he did, sifting the barley for him and cleaning out the manger; a\ndegree of humility which made the other feel bound to tell him with a\ngood grace what he had asked; so seating himself on a bench, with Don\nQuixote beside him, and the cousin, the page, Sancho Panza, and the\nlandlord, for a senate and an audience, he began his story in this way:\n\n\"You must know that in a village four leagues and a half from this inn,\nit so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery of a\nservant girl of his (it's too long a tale to tell), lost an ass; and\nthough he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to no purpose.\nA fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the ass had been\nmissing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the plaza,\nanother regidor of the same town said to him, 'Pay me for good news,\ngossip; your ass has turned up.' 'That I will, and well, gossip,' said\nthe other; 'but tell us, where has he turned up?' 'In the forest,' said\nthe finder; 'I saw him this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any\nsort, and so lean that it went to one's heart to see him. I tried to\ndrive him before me and bring him to you, but he is already so wild and\nshy that when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the\nforest. If you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him,\nlet me put up this she-ass at my house and I'll be back at once.' 'You\nwill be doing me a great kindness,' said the owner of the ass, 'and I'll\ntry to pay it back in the same coin.' It is with all these circumstances,\nand in the very same way I am telling it now, that those who know all\nabout the matter tell the story. Well then, the two regidors set off on\nfoot, arm in arm, for the forest, and coming to the place where they\nhoped to find the ass they could not find him, nor was he to be seen\nanywhere about, search as they might. Seeing, then, that there was no\nsign of him, the regidor who had seen him said to the other, 'Look here,\ngossip; a plan has occurred to me, by which, beyond a doubt, we shall\nmanage to discover the animal, even if he is stowed away in the bowels of\nthe earth, not to say the forest. Here it is. I can bray to perfection,\nand if you can ever so little, the thing's as good as done.' 'Ever so\nlittle did you say, gossip?' said the other; 'by God, I'll not give in to\nanybody, not even to the asses themselves.' 'We'll soon see,' said the\nsecond regidor, 'for my plan is that you should go one side of the\nforest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now\nand then you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass\nwill hear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.' To which the owner\nof the ass replied, 'It's an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and\nworthy of your great genius;' and the two separating as agreed, it so\nfell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived\nby the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up\nat last. When they came in sight of one another, said the loser, 'Is it\npossible, gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?' 'No, it was I,'\nsaid the other. 'Well then, I can tell you, gossip,' said the ass's\nowner, 'that between you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as\nfar as braying goes, for I never in all my life saw or heard anything\nmore natural.' 'Those praises and compliments belong to you more justly\nthan to me, gossip,' said the inventor of the plan; 'for, by the God that\nmade me, you might give a couple of brays odds to the best and most\nfinished brayer in the world; the tone you have got is deep, your voice\nis well kept up as to time and pitch, and your finishing notes come thick\nand fast; in fact, I own myself beaten, and yield the palm to you, and\ngive in to you in this rare accomplishment.' 'Well then,' said the owner,\n'I'll set a higher value on myself for the future, and consider that I\nknow something, as I have an excellence of some sort; for though I always\nthought I brayed well, I never supposed I came up to the pitch of\nperfection you say.' 'And I say too,' said the second, 'that there are\nrare gifts going to loss in the world, and that they are ill bestowed\nupon those who don't know how to make use of them.' 'Ours,' said the\nowner of the ass, 'unless it is in cases like this we have now in hand,\ncannot be of any service to us, and even in this God grant they may be of\nsome use.' So saying they separated, and took to their braying once more,\nbut every instant they were deceiving one another, and coming to meet one\nanother again, until they arranged by way of countersign, so as to know\nthat it was they and not the ass, to give two brays, one after the other.\nIn this way, doubling the brays at every step, they made the complete\ncircuit of the forest, but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even\nthe sign of one. How could the poor ill-starred brute have answered,\nwhen, in the thickest part of the forest, they found him devoured by\nwolves? As soon as he saw him his owner said, 'I was wondering he did not\nanswer, for if he wasn't dead he'd have brayed when he heard us, or he'd\nhave been no ass; but for the sake of having heard you bray to such\nperfection, gossip, I count the trouble I have taken to look for him well\nbestowed, even though I have found him dead.' 'It's in a good hand,\ngossip,' said the other; 'if the abbot sings well, the acolyte is not\nmuch behind him.' So they returned disconsolate and hoarse to their\nvillage, where they told their friends, neighbours, and acquaintances\nwhat had befallen them in their search for the ass, each crying up the\nother's perfection in braying. The whole story came to be known and\nspread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood; and the devil,\nwho never sleeps, with his love for sowing dissensions and scattering\ndiscord everywhere, blowing mischief about and making quarrels out of\nnothing, contrived to make the people of the other towns fall to braying\nwhenever they saw anyone from our village, as if to throw the braying of\nour regidors in our teeth. Then the boys took to it, which was the same\nthing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of\nhell; and braying spread from one town to another in such a way that the\nmen of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known\nfrom whites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the\nscoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the\nscoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.\nTo-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of\nthe braying town, are going to take the field against another village two\nleagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; and that we\nmay turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and halberds you\nhave seen. These are the curious things I told you I had to tell, and if\nyou don't think them so, I have got no others;\" and with this the worthy\nfellow brought his story to a close.\n\nJust at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirely\nclad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in a loud\nvoice, \"Senor host, have you room? Here's the divining ape and the show\nof the Release of Melisendra just coming.\"\n\n\"Ods body!\" said the landlord, \"why, it's Master Pedro! We're in for a\ngrand night!\" I forgot to mention that the said Master Pedro had his left\neye and nearly half his cheek covered with a patch of green taffety,\nshowing that something ailed all that side. \"Your worship is welcome,\nMaster Pedro,\" continued the landlord; \"but where are the ape and the\nshow, for I don't see them?\" \"They are close at hand,\" said he in the\nchamois leather, \"but I came on first to know if there was any room.\"\n\"I'd make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room for Master\nPedro,\" said the landlord; \"bring in the ape and the show; there's\ncompany in the inn to-night that will pay to see that and the cleverness\nof the ape.\" \"So be it by all means,\" said the man with the patch; \"I'll\nlower the price, and be well satisfied if I only pay my expenses; and now\nI'll go back and hurry on the cart with the ape and the show;\" and with\nthis he went out of the inn.\n\nDon Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and\nwhat was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the\nlandlord replied, \"This is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time\npast has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of the\nrelease of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best and\nbest-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom\nfor many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary\ngift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask him\nanything, he listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on his\nmaster's shoulder, and pressing close to his ear tells him the answer\nwhich Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great deal more about things\npast than about things to come; and though he does not always hit the\ntruth in every case, most times he is not far wrong, so that he makes us\nfancy he has got the devil in him. He gets two reals for every question\nif the ape answers; I mean if his master answers for him after he has\nwhispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedro\nis very rich. He is a 'gallant man' as they say in Italy, and good\ncompany, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six,\ndrinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and his\nshow.\"\n\nMaster Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the\nape--a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not\nvicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, \"Can you\ntell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it be\nwith us? See, here are my two reals,\" and he bade Sancho give them to\nMaster Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, \"Senor, this animal\ndoes not give any answer or information touching things that are to come;\nof things past he knows something, and more or less of things present.\"\n\n\"Gad,\" said Sancho, \"I would not give a farthing to be told what's past\nwith me, for who knows that better than I do myself? And to pay for being\ntold what I know would be mighty foolish. But as you know things present,\nhere are my two reals, and tell me, most excellent sir ape, what is my\nwife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is she diverting herself with?\"\n\nMaster Pedro refused to take the money, saying, \"I will not receive\npayment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;\" and\nthen with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his left shoulder,\nand with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and putting his\nmouth to his master's ear began chattering his teeth rapidly; and having\nkept this up as long as one would be saying a credo, with another spring\nhe brought himself to the ground, and the same instant Master Pedro ran\nin great haste and fell upon his knees before Don Quixote, and embracing\nhis legs exclaimed, \"These legs do I embrace as I would embrace the two\npillars of Hercules, O illustrious reviver of knight-errantry, so long\nconsigned to oblivion! O never yet duly extolled knight, Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha, courage of the faint-hearted, prop of the tottering, arm of\nthe fallen, staff and counsel of all who are unfortunate!\"\n\nDon Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered,\nthe page astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord in\nperplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of the\npuppet-showman, who went on to say, \"And thou, worthy Sancho Panza, the\nbest squire and squire to the best knight in the world! Be of good cheer,\nfor thy good wife Teresa is well, and she is at this moment hackling a\npound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand a jug with a\nbroken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she solaces\nherself at her work.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" said Sancho. \"She is a lucky one, and if it\nwas not for her jealousy I would not change her for the giantess\nAndandona, who by my master's account was a very clever and worthy woman;\nmy Teresa is one of those that won't let themselves want for anything,\nthough their heirs may have to pay for it.\"\n\n\"Now I declare,\" said Don Quixote, \"he who reads much and travels much\nsees and knows a great deal. I say so because what amount of persuasion\ncould have persuaded me that there are apes in the world that can divine\nas I have seen now with my own eyes? For I am that very Don Quixote of La\nMancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gone rather too far in\nmy praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven that it has endowed me\nwith a tender and compassionate heart, always disposed to do good to all\nand harm to none.\"\n\n\"If I had money,\" said the page, \"I would ask senor ape what will happen\nto me in the peregrination I am making.\"\n\nTo this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote's feet,\nreplied, \"I have already said that this little beast gives no answer as\nto the future; but if he did, not having money would be of no\nconsequence, for to oblige Senor Don Quixote, here present, I would give\nup all the profits in the world. And now, because I have promised it, and\nto afford him pleasure, I will set up my show and offer entertainment to\nall who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.\" As soon as he heard\nthis, the landlord, delighted beyond measure, pointed out a place where\nthe show might be fixed, which was done at once.\n\nDon Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape,\nas he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, either\npast or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he retired\nwith Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard\nby anyone, he said to him, \"Look here, Sancho, I have been seriously\nthinking over this ape's extraordinary gift, and have come to the\nconclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a pact,\ntacit or express, with the devil.\"\n\n\"If the packet is express from the devil,\" said Sancho, \"it must be a\nvery dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro to have\nsuch packets?\"\n\n\"Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"I only mean he\nmust have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the\nape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich he will give\nhim his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this I am led to\nbelieve by observing that the ape only answers about things past or\npresent, and the devil's knowledge extends no further; for the future he\nknows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is reserved for God\nalone to know the times and the seasons, and for him there is neither\npast nor future; all is present. This being as it is, it is clear that\nthis ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I am astonished they have\nnot denounced him to the Holy Office, and put him to the question, and\nforced it out of him by whose virtue it is that he divines; because it is\ncertain this ape is not an astrologer; neither his master nor he sets up,\nor knows how to set up, those figures they call judiciary, which are now\nso common in Spain that there is not a jade, or page, or old cobbler,\nthat will not undertake to set up a figure as readily as pick up a knave\nof cards from the ground, bringing to nought the marvellous truth of the\nscience by their lies and ignorance. I know of a lady who asked one of\nthese figure schemers whether her little lap-dog would be in pup and\nwould breed, and how many and of what colour the little pups would be. To\nwhich senor astrologer, after having set up his figure, made answer that\nthe bitch would be in pup, and would drop three pups, one green, another\nbright red, and the third parti-coloured, provided she conceived between\neleven and twelve either of the day or night, and on a Monday or\nSaturday; but as things turned out, two days after this the bitch died of\na surfeit, and senor planet-ruler had the credit all over the place of\nbeing a most profound astrologer, as most of these planet-rulers have.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Sancho, \"I would be glad if your worship would make Master\nPedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship in the cave of\nMontesinos is true; for, begging your worship's pardon, I, for my part,\ntake it to have been all flam and lies, or at any rate something you\ndreamt.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" replied Don Quixote; \"however, I will do what you suggest;\nthough I have my own scruples about it.\"\n\nAt this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell him\nthe show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.\nDon Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to\ntell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of\nMontesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake\nof both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch\nthe ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said:\n\"See here, senor ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain\nthings which happened to him in the cave called the cave of Montesinos\nwere false or true.\" On his making the usual sign the ape mounted on his\nleft shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and Master Pedro said at\nonce, \"The ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in\nthat cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he only knows this\nand no more as regards this question; but if your worship wishes to know\nmore, on Friday next he will answer all that may be asked him, for his\nvirtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to him till Friday,\nas he has said.\"\n\n\"Did I not say, senor,\" said Sancho, \"that I could not bring myself to\nbelieve that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was\ntrue, or even the half of it?\"\n\n\"The course of events will tell, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"time,\nthat discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into the\nlight of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth. But enough\nof that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro's show, for I am\nsure there must be something novel in it.\"\n\n\"Something!\" said Master Pedro; \"this show of mine has sixty thousand\nnovel things in it; let me tell you, Senor Don Quixote, it is one of the\nbest-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but operibus credite et\nnon verbis, and now let's get to work, for it is growing late, and we\nhave a great deal to do and to say and show.\"\n\nDon Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already\nput up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made\nit look splendid and bright. When they came to it Master Pedro ensconced\nhimself inside it, for it was he who had to work the puppets, and a boy,\na servant of his, posted himself outside to act as showman and explain\nthe mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his hand to point to\nthe figures as they came out. And so, all who were in the inn being\narranged in front of the show, some of them standing, and Don Quixote,\nSancho, the page, and cousin, accommodated with the best places, the\ninterpreter began to say what he will hear or see who reads or hears the\nnext chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE DROLL ADVENTURE OF THE PUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHER\nWITH OTHER THINGS IN TRUTH RIGHT GOOD\n\n\nAll were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching the\nshow were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, when\ndrums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off.\nThe noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said,\n\"This true story which is here represented to your worships is taken word\nfor word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads that are\nin everybody's mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about the streets. Its\nsubject is the release by Senor Don Gaiferos of his wife Melisendra, when\na captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in the city of Sansuena, for\nso they called then what is now called Saragossa; and there you may see\nhow Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, just as they sing it--\n\nAt tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,\nFor Melisendra is forgotten now.\n\nAnd that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a\nsceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father of\nMelisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law's inaction and unconcern,\ncomes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence and energy he\nchides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give him half a dozen\nraps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors who say he did give\nthem, and sound ones too; and after having said a great deal to him about\nimperilling his honour by not effecting the release of his wife, he said,\nso the tale runs,\n\nEnough I've said, see to it now.\n\nObserve, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos fuming;\nand you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the table and the\nboard far from him and calls in haste for his armour, and asks his cousin\nDon Roland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how Don Roland\nrefuses to lend it, offering him his company in the difficult enterprise\nhe is undertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will not accept it,\nand says that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, even though she\nwere imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with this he retires\nto arm himself and set out on his journey at once. Now let your worships\nturn your eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be\none of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia;\nthat lady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is the\npeerless Melisendra, for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon\nthe road to France, and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of\nParis and her husband. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs,\nsuch as, perhaps, never was seen. Do you not see that Moor, who silently\nand stealthily, with his finger on his lip, approaches Melisendra from\nbehind? Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry\nshe is in to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and\nhow she bewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to\nblame for the wrong. Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that\ncorridor is King Marsilio of Sansuena, who, having seen the Moor's\ninsolence, at once orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite\nof his) to be seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through\nthe streets of the city according to custom, with criers going before him\nand officers of justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute\nthe sentence, although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among\nthe Moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us.\"\n\nHere Don Quixote called out, \"Child, child, go straight on with your\nstory, and don't run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact\nclearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;\" and\nsaid Master Pedro from within, \"Boy, stick to your text and do as the\ngentleman bids you; it's the best plan; keep to your plain song, and\ndon't attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over\nfine.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the boy, and he went on to say, \"This figure that you see\nhere on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferos himself,\nwhom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor, and taking\nher stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more tranquil\ncountenance, has perceived without recognising him; and she addresses her\nhusband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds with him all that\nconversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs--\n\nIf you, sir knight, to France are bound,\nOh! for Gaiferos ask--\n\nwhich I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it\nto observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful\ngestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, we\nnow see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the\nhaunches of her good husband's horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of\nher petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is\nleft hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how\ncompassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances,\nand without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizes\nher and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk places\nher on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her hold\non tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast\nso as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of\nriding. You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his\nsatisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord\nand lady. You see how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and\ngladness take the road to Paris. Go in peace, O peerless pair of true\nlovers! May you reach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may\nfortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes\nof your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity\nthe remaining days of your life--and that they may be as many as those of\nNestor!\"\n\nHere Master Pedro called out again and said, \"Simplicity, boy! None of\nyour high flights; all affectation is bad.\"\n\nThe interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, \"There was no want of\nidle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down and mount,\nand word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders to sound\nthe alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drowned with\nthe sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Don Quixote at this; \"on that point of the bells Master\nPedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among the Moors; only\nkettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our clarion; to\nring bells this way in Sansuena is unquestionably a great absurdity.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, \"Don't look into\ntrifles, Senor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch of\nperfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day a\nthousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of\ninaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successful\nrun, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration and\nall the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don't mind; for so long as I fill my\npouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are motes in a\nsunbeam.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: \"See what a\nnumerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in pursuit\nof the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is, what\nsounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me they will\novertake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own horse,\nwhich would be a dreadful sight.\"\n\nDon Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a\ndin, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up he\nexclaimed in a loud voice, \"Never, while I live, will I permit foul play\nto be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearless lover\nas Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him not nor pursue him, or\nye will have to reckon with me in battle!\" and suiting the action to the\nword, he drew his sword, and with one bound placed himself close to the\nshow, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower down blows on\nthe puppet troop of Moors, knocking over some, decapitating others,\nmaiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more he delivered\none down stroke which, if Master Pedro had not ducked, made himself\nsmall, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his head as easily\nas if it had been made of almond-paste. Master Pedro kept shouting, \"Hold\nhard! Senor Don Quixote! can't you see they're not real Moors you're\nknocking down and killing and destroying, but only little pasteboard\nfigures! Look--sinner that I am!--how you're wrecking and ruining all\nthat I'm worth!\" But in spite of this, Don Quixote did not leave off\ndischarging a continuous rain of cuts, slashes, downstrokes, and\nbackstrokes, and at length, in less than the space of two credos, he\nbrought the whole show to the ground, with all its fittings and figures\nshivered and knocked to pieces, King Marsilio badly wounded, and the\nEmperor Charlemagne with his crown and head split in two. The whole\naudience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of the inn,\nthe cousin was frightened, and even Sancho Panza himself was in mighty\nfear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seen his\nmaster in such a furious passion.\n\nThe complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don Quixote\nbecame a little calmer, said, \"I wish I had here before me now all those\nwho do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the\nworld; just think, if I had not been here present, what would have become\nof the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Depend upon it, by\nthis time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage\nupon them. So, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living\non earth this day!\"\n\n\"Let it live, and welcome,\" said Master Pedro at this in a feeble voice,\n\"and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can say with King Don\nRodrigo--\n\nYesterday was I lord of Spain\nTo-day I've not a turret left\nThat I may call mine own.\n\nNot half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings\nand emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my trunks\nand bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself ruined and\nlaid low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my ape, for, by\nmy faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have him caught;\nand all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who, they say,\nprotects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable\ndeeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case\nonly, blessed and praised be the highest heavens! Verily, knight of the\nrueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine.\"\n\nSancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro's words, and said to him, \"Don't\nweep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let me tell you my\nmaster, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a Christian that, if\nhe can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will own it, and be\nwilling to pay for it and make it good, and something over and above.\"\n\n\"Only let Senor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he has\ndestroyed,\" said Master Pedro, \"and I would be content, and his worship\nwould ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps what is\nanother's against the owner's will, and makes no restitution.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote; \"but at present I am not aware that I\nhave got anything of yours, Master Pedro.\"\n\n\"What!\" returned Master Pedro; \"and these relics lying here on the bare\nhard ground--what scattered and shattered them but the invincible\nstrength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies they belonged to\nbut mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?\"\n\n\"Now am I fully convinced,\" said Don Quixote, \"of what I had many a time\nbefore believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing more\nthan put figures like these before my eyes, and then change and turn them\ninto what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure you gentlemen who\nnow hear me, that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to\ntake place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra, Don Gaiferos Don\nGaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne Charlemagne. That was why my\nanger was roused; and to be faithful to my calling as a knight-errant I\nsought to give aid and protection to those who fled, and with this good\nintention I did what you have seen. If the result has been the opposite\nof what I intended, it is no fault of mine, but of those wicked beings\nthat persecute me; but, for all that, I am willing to condemn myself in\ncosts for this error of mine, though it did not proceed from malice; let\nMaster Pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures, for I agree to\npay it at once in good and current money of Castile.\"\n\nMaster Pedro made him a bow, saying, \"I expected no less of the rare\nChristianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper and\nprotector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and\nthe great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between\nyour worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be\nworth.\"\n\nThe landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up from\nthe ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said, \"Here\nyou see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, so\nI think, saving your better judgments, that for his death, decease, and\ndemise, four reals and a half may be given me.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,\" continued Master\nPedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, \"it would not be much if\nI were to ask five reals and a quarter.\"\n\n\"It's not little,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Nor is it much,\" said the landlord; \"make it even, and say five reals.\"\n\n\"Let him have the whole five and a quarter,\" said Don Quixote; \"for the\nsum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or\nless; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it's getting on to\nsupper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.\"\n\n\"For this figure,\" said Master Pedro, \"that is without a nose, and wants\nan eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable in my\ncharge, two reals and twelve maravedis.\"\n\n\"The very devil must be in it,\" said Don Quixote, \"if Melisendra and her\nhusband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the horse\nthey rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so you needn't try\nto sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noseless Melisendra\nwhen she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her ease with her husband in\nFrance. God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, and let us all\nproceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.\"\n\nMaster Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and\nreturn to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he\nsaid to him, \"This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels\nthat waited on her; so if I'm given sixty maravedis for her, I'll be\ncontent and sufficiently paid.\"\n\nAnd so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,\nwhich, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of\nboth parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and above\nthis sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two\nreals for his trouble in catching the ape.\n\n\"Let him have them, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"not to catch the ape, but\nto get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good news,\nto anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Dona Melisandra and\nSenor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own people.\"\n\n\"No one could tell us that better than my ape,\" said Master Pedro; \"but\nthere's no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, that\naffection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night; but\nto-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.\"\n\nIn short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and\ngood fellowship at Don Quixote's expense, for he was the height of\ngenerosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds\ntook his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came\nto bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter\nresuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him\ntwelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver\nwith Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and\nhaving got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too\nwent off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don\nQuixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity.\nTo conclude, Sancho, by his master's orders, paid him very liberally, and\ntaking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning\nand took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey,\nfor this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set\nforth, which are required to clear up this famous history.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nWHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS APE WERE, TOGETHER WITH THE\nMISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE DID NOT\nCONCLUDE AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED OR AS HE HAD EXPECTED\n\n\nCide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter\nwith these words, \"I swear as a Catholic Christian;\" with regard to which\nhis translator says that Cide Hamete's swearing as a Catholic Christian,\nhe being--as no doubt he was--a Moor, only meant that, just as a Catholic\nChristian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is true, and\ntell the truth in what he avers, so he was telling the truth, as much as\nif he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he chose to write about\nQuixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was and what was the\ndivining ape that astonished all the villages with his divinations. He\nsays, then, that he who has read the First Part of this history will\nremember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with other galley\nslaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness for which\nhe afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded,\nill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte--Don Ginesillo de Parapilla,\nDon Quixote called him--it was that stole Dapple from Sancho Panza;\nwhich, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when\nwas stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle to a good many people,\nwho attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the\npress. In fact, however, Gines stole him while Sancho Panza was asleep on\nhis back, adopting the plan and device that Brunello had recourse to when\nhe stole Sacripante's horse from between his legs at the siege of\nAlbracca; and, as has been told, Sancho afterwards recovered him. This\nGines, then, afraid of being caught by the officers of justice, who were\nlooking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences\n(which were so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving\nan account of them), resolved to shift his quarters into the kingdom of\nAragon, and cover up his left eye, and take up the trade of a\npuppet-showman; for this, as well as juggling, he knew how to practise to\nperfection. From some released Christians returning from Barbary, it so\nhappened, he bought the ape, which he taught to mount upon his shoulder\non his making a certain sign, and to whisper, or seem to do so, in his\near. Thus prepared, before entering any village whither he was bound with\nhis show and his ape, he used to inform himself at the nearest village,\nor from the most likely person he could find, as to what particular\nthings had happened there, and to whom; and bearing them well in mind,\nthe first thing he did was to exhibit his show, sometimes one story,\nsometimes another, but all lively, amusing, and familiar. As soon as the\nexhibition was over he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape,\nassuring the public that he divined all the past and the present, but as\nto the future he had no skill. For each question answered he asked two\nreals, and for some he made a reduction, just as he happened to feel the\npulse of the questioners; and when now and then he came to houses where\nthings that he knew of had happened to the people living there, even if\nthey did not ask him a question, not caring to pay for it, he would make\nthe sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so, which\nfitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired a prodigious name and\nall ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he would answer\nin such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no one\ncross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined, he made\nfools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant he entered the inn he\nknew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge it was easy for him\nto astonish them and all who were there; but it would have cost him dear\nhad Don Quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off King\nMarsilio's head and destroyed all his horsemen, as related in the\npreceeding chapter.\n\nSo much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of\nall, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the\ncity of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the\njousts left him enough for all. With this object in view he followed the\nroad and travelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure\nworth committing to writing until on the third day, as he was ascending a\nhill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots. At\nfirst he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to\nsee them he spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill. On reaching the top\nhe saw at the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed\nwith weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds,\nand pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. He descended the\nslope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags,\nmake out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially\none on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in\na very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its\nmouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of\nbraying; and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines--\n\nThey did not bray in vain,\nOur alcaldes twain.\n\nFrom this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from the\nbraying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was\nwritten on the standard. At the same time he observed that the man who\nhad told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who\nbrayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they\nwere alcaldes. To which Sancho replied, \"Senor, there's nothing to stick\nat in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of\ntheir town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it\nhas nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were\nalcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde\nis just as likely to bray as a regidor.\" They perceived, in short,\nclearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle\nwith some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.\n\nDon Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho's uneasiness,\nfor he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that sort. The\nmembers of the troop received him into the midst of them, taking him to\nbe some one who was on their side. Don Quixote, putting up his visor,\nadvanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with the ass,\nand all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look at him,\nstaring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing him\nfor the first time. Don Quixote, seeing them examining him so\nattentively, and that none of them spoke to him or put any question to\nhim, determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own,\nhe lifted up his voice and said, \"Worthy sirs, I entreat you as earnestly\nas I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you, until you\nfind it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, on the\nslightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon\nmy tongue.\"\n\nThey all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to him\nwillingly.\n\nWith this permission Don Quixote went on to say, \"I, sirs, am a\nknight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to\nprotect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in\nneed of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and\nthe cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge\nyourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your\nbusiness in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you\nare mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual\ncannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it\ncollectively as a traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is\nguilty of the treason for which he defies it. Of this we have an example\nin Don Diego Ordonez de Lara, who defied the whole town of Zamora,\nbecause he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the\ntreachery of slaying his king; and therefore he defied them all, and the\nvengeance and the reply concerned all; though, to be sure, Senor Don\nDiego went rather too far, indeed very much beyond the limits of a\ndefiance; for he had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters, or the\nfishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest of it as set forth; but let\nthat pass, for when anger breaks out there's no father, governor, or\nbridle to check the tongue. The case being, then, that no one person can\ninsult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entire community, it is clear\nthere is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an\ninsult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing it would be if the people\nof the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone\nwho called them by that name,--or the Cazoleros, Berengeneros,\nBallenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all the other names and titles\nthat are always in the mouth of the boys and common people! It would be a\nnice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff\nand revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their\nswords in every petty quarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are four things\nfor which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take up arms,\ndraw their swords, and risk their persons, lives, and properties. The\nfirst is to defend the Catholic faith; the second, to defend one's life,\nwhich is in accordance with natural and divine law; the third, in defence\nof one's honour, family, and property; the fourth, in the service of\none's king in a just war; and if to these we choose to add a fifth (which\nmay be included in the second), in defence of one's country. To these\nfive, as it were capital causes, there may be added some others that may\nbe just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take\nthem up for trifles and things to laugh at and he amused by rather than\noffended, looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in common\nsense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there cannot be any just\none) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge, wherein\nwe are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us;\na command which, though it seems somewhat difficult to obey, is only so\nto those who have in them less of God than of the world, and more of the\nflesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ, God and true man, who never\nlied, and could not and cannot lie, said, as our law-giver, that his yoke\nwas easy and his burden light; he would not, therefore, have laid any\ncommand upon us that it was impossible to obey. Thus, sirs, you are bound\nto keep quiet by human and divine law.\"\n\n\"The devil take me,\" said Sancho to himself at this, \"but this master of\nmine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he's as like one as one egg is\nlike another.\"\n\nDon Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was still\npreserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have done so\nhad not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing his master\npause, took the lead, saying, \"My lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, who once\nwas called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but now is called the\nKnight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knows Latin\nand his mother tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that he deals\nwith or advises proceeds like a good soldier, and has all the laws and\nordinances of what they call combat at his fingers' ends; so you have\nnothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says, and on my\nhead be it if it is wrong. Besides which, you have been told that it is\nfolly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was a\nboy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and\nso elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town\nwould bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who\nwere greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by\nmore than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two\nfarthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit\nand listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;\"\nand then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that\nall the valleys around rang again.\n\nOne of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them,\nlifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with\nit that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him so\nroughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but\nso many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. Far\nfrom it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and\nmuskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante round and, as\nfast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them,\ncommending himself to God with all his heart to deliver him out of this\nperil, in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming\nout at his breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it\nhad gone from him. The members of the band, however, were satisfied with\nseeing him take to flight, and did not fire on him. They put up Sancho,\nscarcely restored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his\nmaster; not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but\nDapple followed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain\na moment separated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and\nseeing Sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one\nfollowed him. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as\nthe enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town\nexulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks,\nthey would have erected a trophy on the spot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nOF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE READS\nTHEM WITH ATTENTION\n\n\nWhen the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men to\nreserve themselves for better occasions. This proved to be the case with\nDon Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the\nhostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without a\nthought of Sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him, retreated to\nsuch a distance as he thought made him safe. Sancho, lying across his\nass, followed him, as has been said, and at length came up, having by\nthis time recovered his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off\nDapple at Rocinante's feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. Don Quixote\ndismounted to examine his wounds, but finding him whole from head to\nfoot, he said to him, angrily enough, \"In an evil hour didst thou take to\nbraying, Sancho! Where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention\nthe rope in the house of the man that has been hanged? To the music of\nbrays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels? Give thanks\nto God, Sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick,\nand did not mark thee per signum crucis with a cutlass.\"\n\n\"I'm not equal to answering,\" said Sancho, \"for I feel as if I was\nspeaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get away from this; I'll\nkeep from braying, but not from saying that knights-errant fly and leave\ntheir good squires to be pounded like privet, or made meal of at the\nhands of their enemies.\"\n\n\"He does not fly who retires,\" returned Don Quixote; \"for I would have\nthee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon a foundation\nof prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rash man are to\nbe attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so I own that I\nretired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed the example of\nmany valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; the\nhistories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any good\nto thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.\"\n\nSancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who then\nhimself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take\nshelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.\nEvery now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, and\non Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he replied\nthat, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck, he was so\nsore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.\n\n\"The cause of that soreness,\" said Don Quixote, \"will be, no doubt, that\nthe staff wherewith they smote thee being a very long one, it caught thee\nall down the back, where all the parts that are sore are situated, and\nhad it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said Sancho, \"your worship has relieved me of a great doubt,\nand cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o' me! is the\ncause of my soreness such a mystery that there's any need to tell me I am\nsore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles that pained me\nthere might be something in going divining why they did, but it is not\nmuch to divine that I'm sore where they thrashed me. By my faith, master\nmine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I am discovering more\nand more how little I have to hope for from keeping company with your\nworship; for if this time you have allowed me to be drubbed, the next\ntime, or a hundred times more, we'll have the blanketings of the other\nday over again, and all the other pranks which, if they have fallen on my\nshoulders now, will be thrown in my teeth by-and-by. I would do a great\ndeal better (if I was not an ignorant brute that will never do any good\nall my life), I would do a great deal better, I say, to go home to my\nwife and children and support them and bring them up on what God may\nplease to give me, instead of following your worship along roads that\nlead nowhere and paths that are none at all, with little to drink and\nless to eat. And then when it comes to sleeping! Measure out seven feet\non the earth, brother squire, and if that's not enough for you, take as\nmany more, for you may have it all your own way and stretch yourself to\nyour heart's content. Oh that I could see burnt and turned to ashes the\nfirst man that meddled with knight-errantry or at any rate the first who\nchose to be squire to such fools as all the knights-errant of past times\nmust have been! Of those of the present day I say nothing, because, as\nyour worship is one of them, I respect them, and because I know your\nworship knows a point more than the devil in all you say and think.\"\n\n\"I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that now\nthat you are talking on without anyone to stop you, you don't feel a pain\nin your whole body. Talk away, my son, say whatever comes into your head\nor mouth, for so long as you feel no pain, the irritation your\nimpertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and if you are so anxious\nto go home to your wife and children, God forbid that I should prevent\nyou; you have money of mine; see how long it is since we left our village\nthis third time, and how much you can and ought to earn every month, and\npay yourself out of your own hand.\"\n\n\"When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor Samson\nCarrasco that your worship knows,\" replied Sancho, \"I used to earn two\nducats a month besides my food; I can't tell what I can earn with your\nworship, though I know a knight-errant's squire has harder times of it\nthan he who works for a farmer; for after all, we who work for farmers,\nhowever much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, we have our olla\nsupper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since I have been in\nyour worship's service, if it wasn't the short time we were in Don Diego\nde Miranda's house, and the feast I had with the skimmings I took off\nCamacho's pots, and what I ate, drank, and slept in Basilio's house; all\nthe rest of the time I have been sleeping on the hard ground under the\nopen sky, exposed to what they call the inclemencies of heaven, keeping\nlife in me with scraps of cheese and crusts of bread, and drinking water\neither from the brooks or from the springs we come to on these by-paths\nwe travel.\"\n\n\"I own, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest is true; how\nmuch, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above what Tom\nCarrasco gave thee?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Sancho, \"that if your worship was to add on two reals a\nmonth I'd consider myself well paid; that is, as far as the wages of my\nlabour go; but to make up to me for your worship's pledge and promise to\nme to give me the government of an island, it would be fair to add six\nreals more, making thirty in all.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Don Quixote; \"it is twenty-five days since we left our\nvillage, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wages you have made out\nfor yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion, and pay yourself,\nas I said before, out of your own hand.\"\n\n\"O body o' me!\" said Sancho, \"but your worship is very much out in that\nreckoning; for when it comes to the promise of the island we must count\nfrom the day your worship promised it to me to this present hour we are\nat now.\"\n\n\"Well, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\n\"If I remember rightly,\" said Sancho, \"it must be over twenty years,\nthree days more or less.\"\n\nDon Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laugh\nheartily, and said he, \"Why, I have not been wandering, either in the\nSierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two\nmonths, and thou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since I promised\nthee the island. I believe now thou wouldst have all the money thou hast\nof mine go in thy wages. If so, and if that be thy pleasure, I give it to\nthee now, once and for all, and much good may it do thee, for so long as\nI see myself rid of such a good-for-nothing squire I'll be glad to be\nleft a pauper without a rap. But tell me, thou perverter of the squirely\nrules of knight-errantry, where hast thou ever seen or read that any\nknight-errant's squire made terms with his lord, 'you must give me so\nmuch a month for serving you'? Plunge, scoundrel, rogue, monster--for\nsuch I take thee to be--plunge, I say, into the mare magnum of their\nhistories; and if thou shalt find that any squire ever said or thought\nwhat thou hast said now, I will let thee nail it on my forehead, and give\nme, over and above, four sound slaps in the face. Turn the rein, or the\nhalter, of thy Dapple, and begone home; for one single step further thou\nshalt not make in my company. O bread thanklessly received! O promises\nill-bestowed! O man more beast than human being! Now, when I was about to\nraise thee to such a position, that, in spite of thy wife, they would\ncall thee 'my lord,' thou art leaving me? Thou art going now when I had a\nfirm and fixed intention of making thee lord of the best island in the\nworld? Well, as thou thyself hast said before now, honey is not for the\nmouth of the ass. Ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thou wilt end\nwhen the course of thy life is run; for I know it will come to its close\nbefore thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast.\"\n\nSancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him this\nrating, and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes,\nand in a piteous and broken voice he said to him, \"Master mine, I confess\nthat, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your worship will\nonly fix one on to me, I'll look on it as rightly placed, and I'll serve\nyou as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgive me and have pity\non my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I talk much, it's\nmore from infirmity than malice; but he who sins and mends commends\nhimself to God.\"\n\n\"I should have been surprised, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"if thou hadst\nnot introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech. Well, well, I\nforgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyself in future so\nfond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer and take heart,\nand encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of my promises,\nwhich, by being delayed, does not become impossible.\"\n\nSancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could. They\nthen entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at the foot of an\nelm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind and others\nlike them always have feet but no hands. Sancho passed the night in pain,\nfor with the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the\nmore. Don Quixote passed it in his never-failing meditations; but, for\nall that, they had some winks of sleep, and with the appearance of\ndaylight they pursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous\nEbro, where that befell them which will be told in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nOF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARK\n\n\nBy stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after\nquitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and the\nsight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated and\ngazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, the\ngentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and\nthe pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind. Above\nall, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos; for though\nMaster Pedro's ape had told him that of those things part was true, part\nfalse, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very\nreverse of Sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.\n\nAs they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without\noars or any other gear, that lay at the water's edge tied to the stem of\na tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round, and seeing\nnobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante and bade\nSancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of\na poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the reason of this\nsudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer, \"Thou must know,\nSancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility of any\nalternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to give\naid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who is\nno doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books of\nchivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them. When a\nknight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered\nsave by the hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of\ntwo or three thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either\ntake him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to get into, and\nin less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and\nwhere his help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is placed here for\nthe same purpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one\npasses tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and then in God's hand be it to\nguide us; for I would not hold back from embarking, though barefooted\nfriars were to beg me.\"\n\n\"As that's the case,\" said Sancho, \"and your worship chooses to give in\nto these--I don't know if I may call them absurdities--at every turn,\nthere's nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind the\nproverb, 'Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with him;'\nbut for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn your\nworship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs\nto some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in\nthe world here.\"\n\nAs Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and\nprotection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don Quixote\nbade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, \"for he who would\ncarry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take care\nto feed them.\"\n\n\"I don't understand that logiquous,\" said Sancho, \"nor have I ever heard\nthe word all the days of my life.\"\n\n\"Longinquous,\" replied Don Quixote, \"means far off; but it is no wonder\nthou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to know Latin, like\nsome who pretend to know it and don't.\"\n\n\"Now they are tied,\" said Sancho; \"what are we to do next?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Don Quixote, \"cross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean,\nembark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;\" and the bark\nbegan to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw himself\nsomewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and give\nhimself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing Dapple\nbray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he to his\nmaster, \"Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and Rocinante is\ntrying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends, peace be with\nyou, and may this madness that is taking us away from you, turned into\nsober sense, bring us back to you.\" And with this he fell weeping so\nbitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply and angrily, \"What art\nthou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thou weeping at, heart of\nbutter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou soul of a tame mouse?\nWhat dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart of abundance? Art\nthou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the Riphaean mountains, instead\nof being seated on a bench like an archduke on the tranquil stream of\nthis pleasant river, from which in a short space we shall come out upon\nthe broad sea? But we must have already emerged and gone seven hundred or\neight hundred leagues; and if I had here an astrolabe to take the\naltitude of the pole, I could tell thee how many we have travelled,\nthough either I know little, or we have already crossed or shall shortly\ncross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite poles midway.\"\n\n\"And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,\" said Sancho, \"how\nfar shall we have gone?\"\n\n\"Very far,\" said Don Quixote, \"for of the three hundred and sixty degrees\nthat this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy, the\ngreatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when we\ncome to the line I spoke of.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said Sancho, \"your worship gives me a nice authority for what\nyou say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is.\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon \"computed,\" and\nthe name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, \"Thou must know,\nSancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for the\nEast Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have\npassed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon\neverybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be found\nin the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so, Sancho,\nthou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest upon\nanything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we have\ncrossed.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a bit of it,\" said Sancho; \"still, I'll do as your\nworship bids me; though I don't know what need there is for trying these\nexperiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five\nyards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where the animals\nstand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very same place where we\nleft them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear by all that's good,\nwe are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.\"\n\n\"Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and don't mind\nany other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines, parallels,\nzodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets, signs,\nbearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are\ncomposed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or any portion\nof them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut, what\nsigns we have seen, and what constellations we have left behind and are\nnow leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel and hunt, for I am\ncertain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper.\"\n\nSancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow\nof his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, \"Either the test\nis a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor\nwithin many leagues of it.\"\n\n\"Why, how so?\" asked Don Quixote; \"hast thou come upon aught?\"\n\n\"Ay, and aughts,\" replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his\nwhole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in\nmidstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter,\nbut simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.\n\nThey now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle\nof the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out, \"Seest\nthou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress, where there\nis, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or\nprincess, in whose aid I am brought hither.\"\n\n\"What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking about,\nsenor?\" said Sancho; \"don't you see that those are mills that stand in\nthe river to grind corn?\"\n\n\"Hold thy peace, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"though they look like mills\nthey are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments transform\nthings and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say they really\nchange them from one form into another, but that it seems as though they\ndid, as experience proved in the transformation of Dulcinea, sole refuge\nof my hopes.\"\n\nBy this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to\nmove less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills, when\nthey saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being sucked\nin by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, with\nlong poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garments\ncovered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They raised\nloud shouts, crying, \"Devils of men, where are you going to? Are you mad?\nDo you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these\nwheels?\"\n\n\"Did I not tell thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote at this, \"that we had\nreached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do? See\nwhat ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters oppose\nme; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! You shall soon\nsee, scoundrels!\" And then standing up in the boat he began in a loud\nvoice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, \"Ill-conditioned and\nworse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the person ye\nhold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or of\nwhatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha,\notherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the disposition of\nheaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this adventure;\"\nand so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in the air at the\nmillers, who, hearing but not understanding all this nonsense, strove to\nstop the boat, which was now getting into the rushing channel of the\nwheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to\ndeliver him from such imminent peril; which it did by the activity and\nquickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with their poles,\nstopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing Don Quixote and\nSancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote that he could\nswim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried him twice to\nthe bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged in and\nhoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the pair of\nthem. As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho\nwent down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven,\nprayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the\nrash projects and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of\nthe boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and\nseeing it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment\nfor it from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing\nhad happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for\nthe bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him,\nfree and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that\ncastle of theirs.\n\n\"What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou for\ncarrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" said Don Quixote to himself, \"it would be preaching in\nthe desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any\nvirtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have\nencountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts; one\nprovided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, this world\nis all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the other. I\ncan do no more.\" And then turning towards the mills he said aloud,\n\"Friends, whoe'er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive me that,\nto my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your misery; this\nadventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight.\"\n\nSo saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the\nboat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying,\n\"With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our\nwhole capital.\"\n\nThe fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two\nfigures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were\nwholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions Don\nQuixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were\nmadmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills,\nand the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote and Sancho returned to their\nbeasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the\nenchanted bark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nOF DON QUIXOTE'S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS\n\n\nThey reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knight\nand squire, Sancho particularly, for with him what touched the stock of\nmoney touched his heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as if he\nwas robbed of the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging a word,\nthey mounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed in\nthoughts of his love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, which just\nthen, it seemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool as he\nwas, he saw clearly enough that his master's acts were all or most of\nthem utterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an opportunity of\nretiring from his service and going home some day, without entering into\nany explanations or taking any farewell of him. Fortune, however, ordered\nmatters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated.\n\nIt so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood,\nDon Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it\nobserved some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking\nparty. Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful\nmien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings\nand a silver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also in green, and so\nrichly and splendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in\nher. On her left hand she bore a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote's mind that\nshe must be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party,\nwhich was the fact; so he said to Sancho, \"Run Sancho, my son, and say to\nthat lady on the palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight of the Lions,\nkiss the hands of her exalted beauty, and if her excellence will grant me\nleave I will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her service\nfor aught that may be in my power and her highness may command; and mind,\nSancho, how thou speakest, and take care not to thrust in any of thy\nproverbs into thy message.\"\n\n\"You've got a likely one here to thrust any in!\" said Sancho; \"leave me\nalone for that! Why, this is not the first time in my life I have carried\nmessages to high and exalted ladies.\"\n\n\"Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,\" said Don Quixote, \"I\nknow not that thou hast carried any other, at least in my service.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Sancho; \"but pledges don't distress a good payer,\nand in a house where there's plenty supper is soon cooked; I mean there's\nno need of telling or warning me about anything; for I'm ready for\neverything and know a little of everything.\"\n\n\"That I believe, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"go and good luck to thee,\nand God speed thee.\"\n\nSancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace, and\ncame to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt\nbefore her and said, \"Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the\nKnight of the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his, and\nat home they call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions, who was\ncalled not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me\nto say may it please your highness to give him leave that, with your\npermission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his\nwishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted\nloftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing\nwhich will redound to your honour, and he will receive a most\ndistinguished favour and happiness.\"\n\n\"You have indeed, squire,\" said the lady, \"delivered your message with\nall the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not right\nthat the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance, of\nwhom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his knees; rise,\nmy friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of myself and the\nduke my husband, in a country house we have here.\"\n\nSancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her\nhigh-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said\nabout having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;\nfor if she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because\nhe had so lately taken the name. \"Tell me, brother squire,\" asked the\nduchess (whose title, however, is not known), \"this master of yours, is\nhe not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called 'The\nIngenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,' who has for the lady of\nhis heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?\"\n\n\"He is the same, senora,\" replied Sancho; \"and that squire of his who\nfigures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name of Sancho\nPanza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, I mean in\nthe press.\"\n\n\"I am rejoiced at all this,\" said the duchess; \"go, brother Panza, and\ntell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothing could\nhappen to me that could give me greater pleasure.\"\n\nSancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying\nanswer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to the\nskies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and\nher courtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed\nhimself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and\nwith an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who,\nhaving sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while Don Quixote\nwas approaching all about the message; and as both of them had read the\nFirst Part of this history, and from it were aware of Don Quixote's crazy\nturn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his\nacquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with\neverything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat him as\na knight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry\nthey had read, for they themselves were very fond of them.\n\nDon Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about to\ndismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but in\ngetting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of\nthe ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it,\nand was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. Don\nQuixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,\nfancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threw\nhimself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante's saddle after him, which\nwas no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to the ground;\nnot without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered between his\nteeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot still in the shackles.\nThe duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knight and squire, and\nthey raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his fall; and he, limping,\nadvanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair. This, however,\nthe duke would by no means permit; on the contrary, dismounting from his\nhorse, he went and embraced Don Quixote, saying, \"I am grieved, Sir\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance, that your first experience on my ground\nshould have been such an unfortunate one as we have seen; but the\ncarelessness of squires is often the cause of worse accidents.\"\n\n\"That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,\" replied Don\nQuixote, \"cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had not stopped short of\nthe depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of having seen you would\nhave lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God's curse upon\nhim, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence than in\ntightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however I may\nbe, fallen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall always be at\nyour service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthy\nqueen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy.\"\n\n\"Gently, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" said the duke; \"where my lady\nDona Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should\nbe praised.\"\n\nSancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, and\nbefore his master could answer he said, \"There is no denying, and it must\nbe maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful; but\nthe hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have heard say that\nwhat we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and he\nwho makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred; I\nsay so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my\nmistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.\"\n\nDon Quixote turned to the duchess and said, \"Your highness may conceive\nthat never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a droller\nsquire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say, if your\nhighness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.\"\n\nTo which the duchess made answer, \"that worthy Sancho is droll I consider\na very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for drollery\nand sprightliness, Senor Don Quixote, as you very well know, do not take\nup their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll and sprightly\nI here set him down as shrewd.\"\n\n\"And talkative,\" added Don Quixote.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said the duke, \"for many droll things cannot be\nsaid in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of\nthe Rueful Countenance-\"\n\n\"Of the Lions, your highness must say,\" said Sancho, \"for there is no\nRueful Countenance nor any such character now.\"\n\n\"He of the Lions be it,\" continued the duke; \"I say, let Sir Knight of\nthe Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that\nreception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess\nand I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\"\n\nBy this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante's saddle, and Don\nQuixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they\nplaced the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess\ndesired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in\nlistening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed\nhimself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to\nreceive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS\n\n\nSupreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it\nseemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward\nto finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego's house and in\nBasilio's; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the\nforelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented\nitself. The history informs us, then, that before they reached the\ncountry house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all\nhis servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he\ncame up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries,\nclad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to\ntheir feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before\nhe saw or heard them, said to him, \"Your highness should go and take my\nlady the duchess off her horse.\"\n\nDon Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between\nthe two over the matter; but in the end the duchess's determination\ncarried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey\nexcept in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself\nworthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length\nthe duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court\ntwo fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote's shoulders a\nlarge mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the\ngalleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and\nwomen-servants of the household, crying, \"Welcome, flower and cream of\nknight-errantry!\" while all or most of them flung pellets filled with\nscented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don\nQuixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he\nthoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and\nnot merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as\nhe had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.\n\nSancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle,\nbut feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, he\napproached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receive\nthe duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, \"Senora Gonzalez, or\nhowever your grace may be called-\"\n\n\"I am called Dona Rodriguez de Grijalba,\" replied the duenna; \"what is\nyour will, brother?\" To which Sancho made answer, \"I should be glad if\nyour worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, where\nyou will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him in\nthe stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast is\nrather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.\"\n\n\"If the master is as wise as the man,\" said the duenna, \"we have got a\nfine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him who\nbrought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this\nhouse, are not used to work of that sort.\"\n\n\"Well then, in troth,\" returned Sancho, \"I have heard my master, who is\nthe very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot when\nhe came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon\nhis hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn't change him for Senor\nLancelot's hack.\"\n\n\"If you are a jester, brother,\" said the duenna, \"keep your drolleries\nfor some place where they'll pass muster and be paid for; for you'll get\nnothing from me but a fig.\"\n\n\"At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,\" said Sancho, \"for you won't\nlose the trick in years by a point too little.\"\n\n\"Son of a bitch,\" said the duenna, all aglow with anger, \"whether I'm old\nor not, it's with God I have to reckon, not with you, you garlic-stuffed\nscoundrel!\" and she said it so loud, that the duchess heard it, and\nturning round and seeing the duenna in such a state of excitement, and\nher eyes flaming so, asked whom she was wrangling with.\n\n\"With this good fellow here,\" said the duenna, \"who has particularly\nrequested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gate into\nthe stable, holding it up to me as an example that they did the same I\ndon't know where--that some ladies waited on one Lancelot, and duennas on\nhis hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he called me old.\"\n\n\"That,\" said the duchess, \"I should have considered the greatest affront\nthat could be offered me;\" and addressing Sancho, she said to him, \"You\nmust know, friend Sancho, that Dona Rodriguez is very youthful, and that\nshe wears that hood more for authority and custom's sake than because of\nher years.\"\n\n\"May all the rest of mine be unlucky,\" said Sancho, \"if I meant it that\nway; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great,\nand I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person than\nthe lady Dona Rodriguez.\"\n\nDon Quixote, who was listening, said to him, \"Is this proper conversation\nfor the place, Sancho?\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"every one must mention what he wants wherever\nhe may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had\nthought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.\"\n\nOn which the duke observed, \"Sancho is quite right, and there is no\nreason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart's\ncontent, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself.\"\n\nWhile this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was\nproceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a\nchamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved\nhim of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and\ninstructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how\nthey were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they\nwere treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was removed,\nthere stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois\ndoublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing\neach other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him had\nnot taken care to check their merriment (which was one of the particular\ndirections their master and mistress had given them), they would have\nburst with laughter. They asked him to let himself be stripped that they\nmight put a shirt on him, but he would not on any account, saying that\nmodesty became knights-errant just as much as valour. However, he said\nthey might give the shirt to Sancho; and shutting himself in with him in\na room where there was a sumptuous bed, he undressed and put on the\nshirt; and then, finding himself alone with Sancho, he said to him, \"Tell\nme, thou new-fledged buffoon and old booby, dost thou think it right to\noffend and insult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that\none just now? Was that a time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these\nnoble personages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat\ntheir owners in such elegant style? For God's sake, Sancho, restrain\nthyself, and don't show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse,\nboorish texture thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master\nis the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are;\nand that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men\nis that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost\nthou not see--shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that I\nam!--that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull blockhead,\nthey will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay, nay, Sancho\nfriend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these stumbling-blocks; for he who\nfalls into the way of being a chatterbox and droll, drops into a wretched\nbuffoon the first time he trips; bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh\nthy words before they escape thy mouth, and bear in mind we are now in\nquarters whence, by God's help, and the strength of my arm, we shall come\nforth mightily advanced in fame and fortune.\"\n\nSancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and to\nbite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to\nthe purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind easy\non that point, for it should never be discovered through him what they\nwere.\n\nDon Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw the\nscarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green\nsatin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into\nthe large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the\nsame number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands,\nwhich they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies. Then\ncame twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to dinner, as\nhis hosts were already waiting for him. They placed him in the midst of\nthem, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another\nroom, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The\nduchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and\nwith them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen's houses;\none of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to\nteach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have\nthe greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one\nof those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they\nrule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the\ngrave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don\nQuixote.\n\nA vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking\nDon Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke\npressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he\nrefused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept\nit.\n\nThe ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess\nthose at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement\nat the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons;\nand observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the\nduke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the\ntable, he said, \"If your worship will give me leave I will tell you a\nstory of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\"\n\nThe moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was\nabout to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing his\nthoughts, said, \"Don't be afraid of my going astray, senor, or saying\nanything that won't be pat to the purpose; I haven't forgotten the advice\nyour worship gave me just now about talking much or little, well or ill.\"\n\n\"I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"say what\nthou wilt, only say it quickly.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"what I am going to say is so true that my\nmaster Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from lying.\"\n\n\"Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for\nI am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going to say.\"\n\n\"I have so considered and reconsidered,\" said Sancho, \"that the\nbell-ringer's in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.\"\n\n\"It would be well,\" said Don Quixote, \"if your highnesses would order\nthem to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a heap of nonsense.\"\n\n\"By the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me for a\nmoment,\" said the duchess; \"I am very fond of him, for I know he is very\ndiscreet.\"\n\n\"Discreet be the days of your holiness,\" said Sancho, \"for the good\nopinion you have of my wit, though there's none in me; but the story I\nwant to tell is this. There was an invitation given by a gentleman of my\ntown, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was one of the Alamos\nof Medina del Campo, and married to Dona Mencia de Quinones, the daughter\nof Don Alonso de Maranon, Knight of the Order of Santiago, that was\ndrowned at the Herradura--him there was that quarrel about years ago in\nour village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in, to the best of\nmy belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of Balbastro the smith,\nwas wounded in.--Isn't all this true, master mine? As you live, say so,\nthat these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer.\"\n\n\"So far,\" said the ecclesiastic, \"I take you to be more a chatterer than\na liar; but I don't know what I shall take you for by-and-by.\"\n\n\"Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth; go on,\nand cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to make an end\nfor two days to come.\"\n\n\"He is not to cut it short,\" said the duchess; \"on the contrary, for my\ngratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though he should not\nfinish it these six days; and if he took so many they would be to me the\npleasantest I ever spent.\"\n\n\"Well then, sirs, I say,\" continued Sancho, \"that this same gentleman,\nwhom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it's not a bowshot from my\nhouse to his, invited a poor but respectable labourer-\"\n\n\"Get on, brother,\" said the churchman; \"at the rate you are going you\nwill not stop with your story short of the next world.\"\n\n\"I'll stop less than half-way, please God,\" said Sancho; \"and so I say\nthis labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I spoke of that\ninvited him--rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he died the\ndeath of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, for just at that\ntime I had gone to reap at Tembleque-\"\n\n\"As you live, my son,\" said the churchman, \"make haste back from\nTembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman, unless\nyou want to make more funerals.\"\n\n\"Well then, it so happened,\" said Sancho, \"that as the pair of them were\ngoing to sit down to table--and I think I can see them now plainer than\never-\"\n\nGreat was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation\nthe worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way Sancho had of\ntelling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing with rage and vexation.\n\n\"So, as I was saying,\" continued Sancho, \"as the pair of them were going\nto sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted upon the\ngentleman's taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insisted upon\nthe labourer's taking it, as his orders should be obeyed in his house;\nbut the labourer, who plumed himself on his politeness and good breeding,\nwould not on any account, until the gentleman, out of patience, putting\nhis hands on his shoulders, compelled him by force to sit down, saying,\n'Sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever I sit will be the head to you;\nand that's the story, and, troth, I think it hasn't been brought in amiss\nhere.\"\n\nDon Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled it\ntill it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed their\nlaughter so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw\nthrough Sancho's impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep\nSancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote what\nnews he had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any presents of\ngiants or miscreants lately, for he could not but have vanquished a good\nmany.\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Senora, my misfortunes, though they had a\nbeginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and I have\nsent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her if she\nis enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench that can\nbe imagined?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Sancho Panza; \"to me she seems the fairest creature\nin the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she won't give in to\na tumbler; by my faith, senora duchess, she leaps from the ground on to\nthe back of an ass like a cat.\"\n\n\"Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?\" asked the duke.\n\n\"What, seen her!\" said Sancho; \"why, who the devil was it but myself that\nfirst thought of the enchantment business? She is as much enchanted as my\nfather.\"\n\nThe ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and\nenchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La\nMancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often\nreproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries;\nand becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the\nduke, he said very angrily to him, \"Senor, your excellence will have to\ngive account to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or Don\nSimpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a\nblockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to\nhim to go on with his vagaries and follies.\" Then turning to address Don\nQuixote he said, \"And you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you\nare a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your\nways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and\nbring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and\ngive over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a\nlaughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don't. Where,\nin heaven's name, have you discovered that there are or ever were\nknights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La\nMancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they\ntell about you?\"\n\nDon Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman's words, and\nas soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence\nof the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an\nagitated countenance, and said--But the reply deserves a chapter to\nitself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nOF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVE\nAND DROLL\n\n\nDon Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head to foot\nlike a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice, \"The\nplace I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have and\nalways have had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold\nand bind the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons\nas because I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman's weapon is the\nsame as a woman's, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equal combat\nwith your worship, from whom one might have expected good advice instead\nof foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof requires a different demeanour\nand arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved me in\npublic, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof, for that\ncomes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is not seemly to\ncall the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without knowing anything of\nthe sin that is reproved. Come, tell me, for which of the stupidities you\nhave observed in me do you condemn and abuse me, and bid me go home and\nlook after my house and wife and children, without knowing whether I have\nany? Is nothing more needed than to get a footing, by hook or by crook,\nin other people's houses to rule over the masters (and that, perhaps,\nafter having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary, and\nwithout having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty or\nthirty leagues round), to fit one to lay down the law rashly for\nchivalry, and pass judgment on knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle\noccupation, or is the time ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world\nin quest, not of its enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the\ngood mount upwards to the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great\nlords, nobles, men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take\nit as an irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have\nnever entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish.\nKnight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most\nHigh. Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of\nmean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some\nthat of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of\nknight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but not\nhonour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences,\nvanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for no other\nreason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so; but though I\nam, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste, platonic sort. My\nintentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evil\nto none; and if he who means this, does this, and makes this his practice\ndeserves to be called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O most\nexcellent duke and duchess.\"\n\n\"Good, by God!\" cried Sancho; \"say no more in your own defence, master\nmine, for there's nothing more in the world to be said, thought, or\ninsisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he has, that\nthere are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it any\nwonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, brother,\" said the ecclesiastic, \"you are that Sancho Panza\nthat is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an island?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Sancho, \"and what's more, I am one who deserves it as\nmuch as anyone; I am one of the sort--'Attach thyself to the good, and\nthou wilt be one of them,' and of those, 'Not with whom thou art bred,\nbut with whom thou art fed,' and of those, 'Who leans against a good\ntree, a good shade covers him;' I have leant upon a good master, and I\nhave been for months going about with him, and please God I shall be just\nsuch another; long life to him and long life to me, for neither will he\nbe in any want of empires to rule, or I of islands to govern.\"\n\n\"No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,\" said the duke, \"for in the name of\nSenor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one of no small\nimportance that I have at my disposal.\"\n\n\"Go down on thy knees, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and kiss the feet of\nhis excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.\"\n\nSancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table\ncompletely out of temper, exclaiming, \"By the gown I wear, I am almost\ninclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners.\nNo wonder they are mad, when people who are in their senses sanction\ntheir madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long as they are\nin the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the trouble of\nreproving what I cannot remedy;\" and without uttering another word, or\neating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of the duke and\nduchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the duke said\nmuch to him, for he could not, because of the laughter his uncalled-for\nanger provoked.\n\nWhen he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, \"You have replied on\nyour own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no\noccasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may look\nlike an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence, no\nmore can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and the reason is, that he who is not\nliable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women, children, and\necclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they may receive\noffence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and the insult\nthere is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference: the insult\ncomes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so, and maintains\nit; the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult. To\ntake an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten\nothers come up armed and beat him; he draws his sword and quits himself\nlike a man, but the number of his antagonists makes it impossible for him\nto effect his purpose and avenge himself; this man suffers an offence but\nnot an insult. Another example will make the same thing plain: a man is\nstanding with his back turned, another comes up and strikes him, and\nafter striking him takes to flight, without waiting an instant, and the\nother pursues him but does not overtake him; he who received the blow\nreceived an offence, but not an insult, because an insult must be\nmaintained. If he who struck him, though he did so sneakingly and\ntreacherously, had drawn his sword and stood and faced him, then he who\nhad been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time;\noffence because he was struck treacherously, insult because he who struck\nhim maintained what he had done, standing his ground without taking to\nflight. And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have\nreceived offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children can\nmaintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing their\nground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; for\nthese three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and\nso, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no\nright to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received\noffence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult can\nstill less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I\nfeel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had\nstayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he makes\nin supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any\nknights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his countless\ndescendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not have gone well\nwith his worship.\"\n\n\"I will take my oath of that,\" said Sancho; \"they would have given him a\nslash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a pomegranate or\na ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with jokes of that sort!\nBy my faith, I'm certain if Reinaldos of Montalvan had heard the little\nman's words he would have given him such a spank on the mouth that he\nwouldn't have spoken for the next three years; ay, let him tackle them,\nand he'll see how he'll get out of their hands!\"\n\nThe duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter,\nand in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his\nmaster; and there were a good many just then who were of the same\nopinion.\n\nDon Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the\ncloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin,\nanother with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on\nher shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in\nher white hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of Naples\nsoap. The one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and\nimpudence, thrust it under Don Quixote's chin, who, wondering at such a\nceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the custom of that\ncountry to wash beards instead of hands; he therefore stretched his out\nas far as he could, and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the\ndamsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly, raising snow-flakes, for\nthe soap lather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over\nthe face, and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were\nperforce obliged to keep shut. The duke and duchess, who had not known\nanything about this, waited to see what came of this strange washing. The\nbarber damsel, when she had him a hand's breadth deep in lather,\npretended that there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go\nand fetch some, while Senor Don Quixote waited. She did so, and Don\nQuixote was left the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be\nimagined. All those present, and there were a good many, were watching\nhim, and as they saw him there with half a yard of neck, and that\nuncommonly brown, his eyes shut, and his beard full of soap, it was a\ngreat wonder, and only by great discretion, that they were able to\nrestrain their laughter. The damsels, the concocters of the joke, kept\ntheir eyes down, not daring to look at their master and mistress; and as\nfor them, laughter and anger struggled within them, and they knew not\nwhat to do, whether to punish the audacity of the girls, or to reward\nthem for the amusement they had received from seeing Don Quixote in such\na plight.\n\nAt length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of\nwashing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately\nwiped him and dried him; and all four together making him a profound\nobeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest Don\nQuixote should see through the joke, called out to the one with the basin\nsaying, \"Come and wash me, and take care that there is water enough.\" The\ngirl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as\nshe had done for Don Quixote, and they soon had him well soaped and\nwashed, and having wiped him dry they made their obeisance and retired.\nIt appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not\nwashed him as they had Don Quixote he would have punished them for their\nimpudence, which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well.\n\nSancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to\nhimself, \"God bless me, if it were only the custom in this country to\nwash squires' beards too as well as knights'. For by God and upon my soul\nI want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides I'd\ntake it as a still greater kindness.\"\n\n\"What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?\" asked the duchess.\n\n\"I was saying, senora,\" he replied, \"that in the courts of other princes,\nwhen the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they give water for\nthe hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it is good to live\nlong that you may see much; to be sure, they say too that he who lives a\nlong life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a washing of that\nsort is pleasure rather than pain.\"\n\n\"Don't be uneasy, friend Sancho,\" said the duchess; \"I will take care\nthat my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.\"\n\n\"I'll be content with the beard,\" said Sancho, \"at any rate for the\npresent; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.\"\n\n\"Attend to worthy Sancho's request, seneschal,\" said the duchess, \"and do\nexactly what he wishes.\"\n\nThe seneschal replied that Senor Sancho should be obeyed in everything;\nand with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him,\nwhile the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a\ngreat variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and\nknight-errantry.\n\nThe duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory,\nto describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her\nbeauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay,\nin all La Mancha.\n\nDon Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess's request, and said, \"If I\ncould pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here before\nyour highness's eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of telling what\ncan hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would see her\nportrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and describe in\ndetail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless Dulcinea, the\nburden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprise\nwherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles, and the graver\nof Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it in\nmarble and bronze, and Ciceronian and Demosthenian eloquence to sound its\npraises?\"\n\n\"What does Demosthenian mean, Senor Don Quixote?\" said the duchess; \"it\nis a word I never heard in all my life.\"\n\n\"Demosthenian eloquence,\" said Don Quixote, \"means the eloquence of\nDemosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two most\neloquent orators in the world.\"\n\n\"True,\" said the duke; \"you must have lost your wits to ask such a\nquestion. Nevertheless, Senor Don Quixote would greatly gratify us if he\nwould depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch she\nwill be something to make the fairest envious.\"\n\n\"I would do so certainly,\" said Don Quixote, \"had she not been blurred to\nmy mind's eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time since,\none of such a nature that I am more ready to weep over it than to\ndescribe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a few days back to\nkiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and permission\nfor this third sally, I found her altogether a different being from the\none I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a\npeasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil, from fragrant to\npestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a\njumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso into a coarse\nSayago wench.\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" said the duke aloud at this, \"who can have done the world\nsuch an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it,\nof the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a\nlustre upon it?\"\n\n\"Who?\" replied Don Quixote; \"who could it be but some malignant enchanter\nof the many that persecute me out of envy--that accursed race born into\nthe world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good,\nand glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters have persecuted\nme, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to\npersecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep\nabyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it\nmost. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the\neyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light, of the food whereby\nhe lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I say it now once more,\na knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building\nwithout a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it.\"\n\n\"There is no denying it,\" said the duchess; \"but still, if we are to\nbelieve the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with\ngeneral applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that\nyou never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the\nworld but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth\nto in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you\nchose.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal to be said on that point,\" said Don Quixote; \"God\nknows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she\nis imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must\nnot be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten nor given birth to\nmy lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a lady who contains in\nherself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the world,\nbeautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender and yet\nmodest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from good breeding, and\nlastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forth and excels with a\nhigher degree of perfection upon good blood than in the fair of lowly\nbirth.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the duke; \"but Senor Don Quixote will give me leave\nto say what I am constrained to say by the story of his exploits that I\nhave read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there is a\nDulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the highest\ndegree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards the\nloftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,\nAlastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you well\nknow, the histories abound.\"\n\n\"To that I may reply,\" said Don Quixote, \"that Dulcinea is the daughter\nof her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue\nis more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. Dulcinea, besides,\nhas that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and sceptred\nqueen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of\nperforming greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she has\nin herself higher fortunes.\"\n\n\"I protest, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the duchess, \"that in all you say,\nyou go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth I\nwill believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my house\nbelieves, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcinea in\nEl Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful and\nnobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Senor Don Quixote in her\nservice, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give\nher or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining a doubt, and\nhaving a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is this, that the\naforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza, when he carried a\nletter on your worship's behalf to the said lady Dulcinea, found her\nsifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it was red wheat; a\nthing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage.\"\n\nTo this Don Quixote made answer, \"Senora, your highness must know that\neverything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary\nlimits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it be that it is\ndirected by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of some\njealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or most famous\nknights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof against\nenchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that\nhe cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the twelve peers\nof France, of whom it is related that he could not be wounded except in\nthe sole of his left foot, and that it must be with the point of a stout\npin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever; and so, when Bernardo\ndel Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles, finding that he could not wound him\nwith steel, he lifted him up from the ground in his arms and strangled\nhim, calling to mind seasonably the death which Hercules inflicted on\nAntaeus, the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra. I would\ninfer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some gift of\nthis kind, not that of being invulnerable, because experience has many\ntimes proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable;\nnor that of being proof against enchantment, for I have already seen\nmyself thrust into a cage, in which all the world would not have been\nable to confine me except by force of enchantments. But as I delivered\nmyself from that one, I am inclined to believe that there is no other\nthat can hurt me; and so, these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert\ntheir vile craft against my person, revenge themselves on what I love\nmost, and seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom\nI live; and therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my\nmessage to her, they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in\nsuch a mean occupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however,\nthat that wheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient\npearl. And as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that,\ncoming to El Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to\ndiscover the palace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my\nsquire, saw her in her own proper shape, which is the fairest in the\nworld, to me she appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by\nno means a well-spoken one, she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am\nnot and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that is\nenchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, and transformed; in\nher have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, and for her shall I live\nin ceaseless tears, until I see her in her pristine state. I have\nmentioned this lest anybody should mind what Sancho said about Dulcinea's\nwinnowing or sifting; for, as they changed her to me, it is no wonder if\nthey changed her to him. Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of\none of the gentle families of El Toboso, which are many, ancient, and\ngood. Therein, most assuredly, not small is the share of the peerless\nDulcinea, through whom her town will be famous and celebrated in ages to\ncome, as Troy was through Helen, and Spain through La Cava, though with a\nbetter title and tradition. For another thing; I would have your graces\nunderstand that Sancho Panza is one of the drollest squires that ever\nserved knight-errant; sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute\nthat it is an amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or\nsharp; he has mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering\nways that prove him a booby; he doubts everything and believes\neverything; when I fancy he is on the point of coming down headlong from\nsheer stupidity, he comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to\nthe skies. After all, I would not exchange him for another squire, though\nI were given a city to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will\nbe well to send him to the government your highness has bestowed upon\nhim; though I perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of\ngoverning, so that, with a little trimming of his understanding, he would\nmanage any government as easily as the king does his taxes; and moreover,\nwe know already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness\nor much learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about us\nthat scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons. The main\npoint is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing\nright in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to\nadvise and direct them in what they have to do, like those\nknight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aid\nof an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender\nno right, and I have some other little matters in reserve, that shall be\nproduced in due season for Sancho's benefit and the advantage of the\nisland he is to govern.\"\n\nThe duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their\nconversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace,\nand Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a\nstraining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,\nmore properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom\ncarried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity\nwas plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followed\nhim everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to\nthrust it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to\nwash his beard.\n\n\"What is all this, brothers?\" asked the duchess. \"What is it? What do you\nwant to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a governor-elect?\"\n\nTo which the barber kitchen-boy replied, \"The gentleman will not let\nhimself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the senor his\nmaster have been.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" said Sancho, in a great rage; \"but I'd like it to be with\ncleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there's not so\nmuch difference between me and my master that he should be washed with\nangels' water and I with devil's lye. The customs of countries and\nprinces' palaces are only good so long as they give no annoyance; but the\nway of washing they have here is worse than doing penance. I have a clean\nbeard, and I don't require to be refreshed in that fashion, and whoever\ncomes to wash me or touch a hair of my head, I mean to say my beard, with\nall due respect be it said, I'll give him a punch that will leave my fist\nsunk in his skull; for cirimonies and soapings of this sort are more like\njokes than the polite attentions of one's host.\"\n\nThe duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho's rage and\nheard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him in such\na sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the hangers-on of the\nkitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the duke and duchess, as if\nto ask their permission to speak, he addressed the rout in a dignified\ntone: \"Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth alone, and go back to where\nyou came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is as clean as any\nother person, and those troughs are as bad as narrow thin-necked jars to\nhim; take my advice and leave him alone, for neither he nor I understand\njoking.\"\n\nSancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, \"Nay, let them come\nand try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it's about as likely I'll\nstand them as that it's now midnight! Let them bring me a comb here, or\nwhat they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they get anything\nout of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip me to the\nskin.\"\n\nUpon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, \"Sancho Panza is\nright, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says\nhimself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not please\nhim, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness have\nbeen excessively careless and thoughtless, I don't know if I ought not to\nsay audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen\ndishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of\nholland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are\nill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help\nshowing the grudge you have against the squires of knights-errant.\"\n\nThe impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took\nthe duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the\nstraining-cloth from Sancho's neck, and with something like shame and\nconfusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he, seeing\nhimself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him, ran and\nfell on his knees before the duchess, saying, \"From great ladies great\nfavours may be looked for; this which your grace has done me today cannot\nbe requited with less than wishing I was dubbed a knight-errant, to\ndevote myself all the days of my life to the service of so exalted a\nlady. I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, I am married, I have\nchildren, and I am serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways I can\nserve your highness, I will not be longer in obeying than your grace in\ncommanding.\"\n\n\"It is easy to see, Sancho,\" replied the duchess, \"that you have learned\nto be polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to say it is easy\nto see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Senor Don Quixote, who\nis, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony--or\ncirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunes of such a\nmaster and such a servant, the one the cynosure of knight-errantry, the\nother the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho, my friend; I will\nrepay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to\nyou the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.\"\n\nWith this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to\ntake his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a\nvery great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with\nher and her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though\nhe certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of\nthe day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his\nmight not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience\nto her command, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders\nwith respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without\ndeparting even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the\nstories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nOF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITH\nSANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING\n\n\nThe history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in\norder to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the\nduchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down\nbeside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding,\nwanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down\nas governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even\nthe chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged his\nshoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess's damsels and\nduennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he\nwould say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:\n\n\"Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I\nshould be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts I\nhave, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in\nprint. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote's letter to her, for it\nwas left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to\ninvent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole\nstory being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of\nthe peerless Dulcinea's good name, a thing that is not at all becoming\nthe character and fidelity of a good squire?\"\n\nAt these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his\nchair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his\nlips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he\ncame back to his seat and said, \"Now, senora, that I have seen that there\nis no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer\nwhat you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread.\nAnd the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my\nmaster Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that,\nto my mind, and indeed everybody's that listens to him, are so wise, and\nrun in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said\nthem better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it's my\nfirm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can\nventure to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like\nthat affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight\ndays ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of the\nenchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him believe she is enchanted,\nthough there's no more truth in it than over the hills of Ubeda.\"\n\nThe duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so\nSancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers\nwere not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, \"In\nconsequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my\nmind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, 'If Don\nQuixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows it,\nand, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his\nempty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier\nthan his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, senora\nduchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he\nwho does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?'\"\n\n\"By God, senora,\" said Sancho, \"but that doubt comes timely; but your\ngrace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know what\nyou say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master long\nago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can't help it, I must\nfollow him; we're from the same village, I've eaten his bread, I'm fond\nof him, I'm grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all I'm\nfaithful; so it's quite impossible for anything to separate us, except\nthe pickaxe and shovel. And if your highness does not like to give me the\ngovernment you promised, God made me without it, and maybe your not\ngiving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, for fool as I\nam I know the proverb 'to her hurt the ant got wings,' and it may be that\nSancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor.\n'They make as good bread here as in France,' and 'by night all cats are\ngrey,' and 'a hard case enough his, who hasn't broken his fast at two in\nthe afternoon,' and 'there's no stomach a hand's breadth bigger than\nanother,' and the same can be filled 'with straw or hay,' as the saying\nis, and 'the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and\ncaterer,' and 'four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer than four of\nSegovia broad-cloth,' and 'when we quit this world and are put\nunderground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the journeyman,'\nand 'the Pope's body does not take up more feet of earth than the\nsacristan's,' for all that the one is higher than the other; for when we\ngo to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make ourselves small, or\nrather they pack us up and make us small in spite of us, and then--good\nnight to us. And I say once more, if your ladyship does not like to give\nme the island because I'm a fool, like a wise man I will take care to\ngive myself no trouble about it; I have heard say that 'behind the cross\nthere's the devil,' and that 'all that glitters is not gold,' and that\nfrom among the oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman\nwas taken to be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and\npleasures, and riches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if\nthe verses of the old ballads don't lie.\"\n\n\"To be sure they don't lie!\" exclaimed Dona Rodriguez, the duenna, who\nwas one of the listeners. \"Why, there's a ballad that says they put King\nRodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards, and\nthat two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice, cried\nout from within the tomb--\n\nThey gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,\nThere where I most did sin.\n\nAnd according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would\nrather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.\"\n\nThe duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or\nwondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,\n\"Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise\nhe strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord and\nhusband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less a\nknight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised island,\nin spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be of good\ncheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on the\nthrone of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of his\ngovernment that he may discard it for another of three-bordered brocade.\nThe charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his vassals,\nbearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.\"\n\n\"As to governing them well,\" said Sancho, \"there's no need of charging me\nto do that, for I'm kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion for\nthe poor; there's no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and bakes;'\nand by my faith it won't do to throw false dice with me; I am an old dog,\nand I know all about 'tus, tus;' I can be wide-awake if need be, and I\ndon't let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches\nme; I say so, because with me the good will have support and protection,\nand the bad neither footing nor access. And it seems to me that, in\ngovernments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having\nbeen governor a fortnight, I'll take kindly to the work and know more\nabout it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\"\n\n\"You are right, Sancho,\" said the duchess, \"for no one is born ready\ntaught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to\nreturn to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the\nlady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than\nevident, that Sancho's idea of practising a deception upon his master,\nmaking him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did\nnot recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device\nof one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and\nearnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who\njumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy\nSancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is\ndeceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,\nthan of anything else we never saw. Senor Sancho Panza must know that we\ntoo have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what\ngoes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or\ndeception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is\nDulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore\nher; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper\nform, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at\npresent.\"\n\n\"All that's very possible,\" said Sancho Panza; \"and now I'm willing to\nbelieve what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos,\nwhere he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress\nand apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to\nplease myself. It must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship\nsays; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a\ncunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I think my master is\nso mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe\na thing so out of all reason. But, senora, your excellence must not\ntherefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me is not bound to see\ninto the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters. I invented all that\nto escape my master's scolding, and not with any intention of hurting\nhim; and if it has turned out differently, there is a God in heaven who\njudges our hearts.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the duchess; \"but tell me, Sancho, what is this you\nsay about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.\"\n\nSancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said\nalready touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said,\n\"From this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote\nsays he saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El\nToboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active\nand exceedingly busy enchanters about.\"\n\n\"So I say,\" said Sancho, \"and if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so much\nthe worse for her, and I'm not going to pick a quarrel with my master's\nenemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. The truth is that the one I\nsaw was a country wench, and I set her down to be a country wench; and if\nthat was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I be called\nto answer for it or take the consequences. But they must go nagging at me\nat every step--'Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho\nthere,' as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that same Sancho Panza\nthat's now going all over the world in books, so Samson Carrasco told me,\nand he's at any rate one that's a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of\nthat sort can't lie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some\nvery good reason for it. So there's no occasion for anybody to quarrel\nwith me; and then I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master\nsay, 'a good name is better than great riches;' let them only stick me\ninto this government and they'll see wonders, for one who has been a good\nsquire will be a good governor.\"\n\n\"All worthy Sancho's observations,\" said the duchess, \"are Catonian\nsentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verino\nhimself, who florentibus occidit annis. In fact, to speak in his own\nstyle, 'under a bad cloak there's often a good drinker.'\"\n\n\"Indeed, senora,\" said Sancho, \"I never yet drank out of wickedness; from\nthirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite in me; I\ndrink when I'm inclined, or, if I'm not inclined, when they offer it to\nme, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when a friend\ndrinks one's health what heart can be so hard as not to return it? But if\nI put on my shoes I don't dirty them; besides, squires to knights-errant\nmostly drink water, for they are always wandering among woods, forests\nand meadows, mountains and crags, without a drop of wine to be had if\nthey gave their eyes for it.\"\n\n\"So I believe,\" said the duchess; \"and now let Sancho go and take his\nsleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and settle how he\nmay soon go and stick himself into the government, as he says.\"\n\nSancho once more kissed the duchess's hand, and entreated her to let good\ncare be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.\n\n\"What is Dapple?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"My ass,\" said Sancho, \"which, not to mention him by that name, I'm\naccustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care of\nhim when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had said\nshe was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper for\nduennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what a\nspite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!\"\n\n\"He must have been some clown,\" said Dona Rodriguez the duenna; \"for if\nhe had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higher\nthan the horns of the moon.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the duchess; \"no more of this; hush, Dona Rodriguez,\nand let Senor Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of Dapple in my\ncharge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho's, I'll put him on the apple of\nmy eye.\"\n\n\"It will be enough for him to be in the stable,\" said Sancho, \"for\nneither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your\nhighness's eye, and I'd as soon stab myself as consent to it; for though\nmy master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many\nthan a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind\nwhat we are about and keep within due bounds.\"\n\n\"Take him to your government, Sancho,\" said the duchess, \"and there you\nwill be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release him\nfrom work and pension him off.\"\n\n\"Don't think, senora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,\" said\nSancho; \"I have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to\ntake mine with me would be nothing new.\"\n\nSancho's words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement,\nand dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the\nconversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and\narranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and\nentirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised\nseveral upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the\nbest adventures this great history contains.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nWHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANT\nTHE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES\nIN THIS BOOK\n\n\nGreat was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of\nDon Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan they\nhad of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and\nappearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what Don\nQuixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in order to\nplay him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at above all was\nthat Sancho's simplicity could be so great as to make him believe as\nabsolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he himself\nwho had been the enchanter and trickster in the business. Having,\ntherefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, six\ndays afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a retinue of\nhuntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.\n\nThey presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another\nof the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on, saying\nthat he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carry\nwardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what they gave him,\nmeaning to sell it at the first opportunity.\n\nThe appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sancho\narrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give him up\nthough they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst of the\ntroop of huntsmen. The duchess came out splendidly attired, and Don\nQuixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey,\nthough the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached a wood\nthat lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various\nposts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different\npositions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so\nthat, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they\ncould not hear one another. The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp\nboar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were\nin the habit of passing. The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and\nplaced themselves one at each side of her. Sancho took up a position in\nthe rear of all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he dared not desert\nlest some mischief should befall him. Scarcely had they taken their stand\nin a line with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar,\nclosely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making\ntowards them, grinding his teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his\nmouth. As soon as he saw him Don Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm,\nand drawing his sword, advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did\nthe same; but the duchess would have gone in front of them all had not\nthe duke prevented her. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of\nthe mighty beast, took to his heels as hard as he could and strove in\nvain to mount a tall oak. As he was clinging to a branch, however,\nhalf-way up in his struggle to reach the top, the bough, such was his\nill-luck and hard fate, gave way, and caught in his fall by a broken limb\nof the oak, he hung suspended in the air unable to reach the ground.\nFinding himself in this position, and that the green coat was beginning\nto tear, and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might\nbe able to get at him, he began to utter such cries, and call for help so\nearnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must\nbe in the teeth of some wild beast. In the end the tusked boar fell\npierced by the blades of the many spears they held in front of him; and\nDon Quixote, turning round at the cries of Sancho, for he knew by them\nthat it was he, saw him hanging from the oak head downwards, with Dapple,\nwho did not forsake him in his distress, close beside him; and Cide\nHamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panza without seeing Dapple, or\nDapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such was their attachment and loyalty\none to the other. Don Quixote went over and unhooked Sancho, who, as soon\nas he found himself on the ground, looked at the rent in his huntingcoat\nand was grieved to the heart, for he thought he had got a patrimonial\nestate in that suit.\n\nMeanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and\nhaving covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they\nbore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which had\nbeen pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables laid\nand dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy to\nsee the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it. Sancho, as he\nshowed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, \"If we had\nbeen hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe\nfrom being in the plight it's in; I don't know what pleasure one can find\nin lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his tusk if\nhe gets at you. I recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says,\n\n  By bears be thou devoured, as erst\n  Was famous Favila.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Don Quixote, \"was a Gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was\ndevoured by a bear.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Sancho; \"and I would not have kings and princes expose\nthemselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to my mind,\nought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that has done no\nharm whatever.\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,\" said the duke; \"for\nhunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for\nanybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles,\nand crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extreme cold\nand intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep are despised,\nthe bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him who engages in it are\nmade supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which may be followed\nwithout injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many; and the best of it\nis, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of other sorts are, except\nhawking, which also is only for kings and great lords. Reconsider your\nopinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are governor take to hunting, and\nyou will find the good of it.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Sancho, \"the good governor should have a broken leg and keep\nat home;\" it would be a nice thing if, after people had been at the\ntrouble of coming to look for him on business, the governor were to be\naway in the forest enjoying himself; the government would go on badly in\nthat fashion. By my faith, senor, hunting and amusements are more fit for\nidlers than for governors; what I intend to amuse myself with is playing\nall fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundays and holidays; for these\nhuntings don't suit my condition or agree with my conscience.\"\n\n\"God grant it may turn out so,\" said the duke; \"because it's a long step\nfrom saying to doing.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" said Sancho, \"'pledges don't distress a good payer,'\nand 'he whom God helps does better than he who gets up early,' and 'it's\nthe tripes that carry the feet and not the feet the tripes;' I mean to\nsay that if God gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no doubt I'll\ngovern better than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put a finger in my\nmouth, and they'll see whether I can bite or not.\"\n\n\"The curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursed Sancho!\"\nexclaimed Don Quixote; \"when will the day come--as I have often said to\nthee--when I shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark\nwithout proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he\nwill grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs,\ndragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose as--may God\ngrant as much health to him, or to me if I want to listen to them!\"\n\n\"Sancho Panza's proverbs,\" said the duchess, \"though more in number than\nthe Greek Commander's, are not therefore less to be esteemed for the\nconciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can say they give me more\npleasure than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably\nintroduced.\"\n\nIn pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into\nthe wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and\nhiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly or\ntranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was then\nmidsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided the\nproject of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall, and a\nlittle after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four sides\nseemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all sides, a\nvast number of trumpets and other military instruments were heard, as if\nseveral troops of cavalry were passing through the wood. The blaze of the\nfire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and\ndeafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were in\nthe wood. Then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of\nthe Moors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums\nbeat, fifes played, so unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had\nany senses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many\ninstruments. The duke was astounded, the duchess amazed, Don Quixote\nwondering, Sancho Panza trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware\nof the cause were frightened. In their fear, silence fell upon them, and\na postillion, in the guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing,\nin lieu of a bugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse\nnote.\n\n\"Ho there! brother courier,\" cried the duke, \"who are you? Where are you\ngoing? What troops are these that seem to be passing through the wood?\"\n\nTo which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, \"I am the\ndevil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are coming\nthis way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal\ncar the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment,\ntogether with the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to\nDon Quixote as to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.\"\n\n\"If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,\"\nsaid the duke, \"you would have known the said knight Don Quixote of La\nMancha, for you have him here before you.\"\n\n\"By God and upon my conscience,\" said the devil, \"I never observed it,\nfor my mind is occupied with so many different things that I was\nforgetting the main thing I came about.\"\n\n\"This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,\" said Sancho;\n\"for if he wasn't he wouldn't swear by God and his conscience; I feel\nsure now there must be good souls even in hell itself.\"\n\nWithout dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said, \"The\nunfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, the Knight of\nthe Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding me tell thee to\nwait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings with him her whom\nthey call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what is needful in\norder to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need stay no longer;\ndemons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with these gentles;\" and\nso saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and went off without\nwaiting for a reply from anyone.\n\nThey all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;\nSancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it that\nDulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel sure\nwhether what had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true or\nnot; and as he was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, \"Do\nyou mean to wait, Senor Don Quixote?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" replied he; \"here will I wait, fearless and firm, though all\nhell should come to attack me.\"\n\n\"Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like the last,\nI'll wait here as much as in Flanders,\" said Sancho.\n\nNight now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit\nthrough the wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that\nlook like shooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a\nfrightful noise, too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the\nox-carts usually have, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they\nsay, the bears and wolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any\nwhere they are passing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a\nfurther disturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in\ntruth, on all four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were\ngoing on at the same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a\nterrible cannonade, in another numberless muskets were being discharged,\nthe shouts of the combatants sounded almost close at hand, and farther\naway the Moorish lelilies were raised again and again. In a word, the\nbugles, the horns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the cannon, the\nmusketry, and above all the tremendous noise of the carts, all made up\ntogether a din so confused and terrific that Don Quixote had need to\nsummon up all his courage to brave it; but Sancho's gave way, and he fell\nfainting on the skirt of the duchess's robe, who let him lie there and\npromptly bade them throw water in his face. This was done, and he came to\nhimself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels\nreached the spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with\nblack housings; on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper,\nand on the top of the cart was constructed a raised seat, on which sat a\nvenerable old man with a beard whiter than the very snow, and so long\nthat it fell below his waist; he was dressed in a long robe of black\nbuckram; for as the cart was thickly set with a multitude of candles it\nwas easy to make out everything that was on it. Leading it were two\nhideous demons, also clad in buckram, with countenances so frightful that\nSancho, having once seen them, shut his eyes so as not to see them again.\nAs soon as the cart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his\nlofty seat, and standing up said in a loud voice, \"I am the sage\nLirgandeo,\" and without another word the cart then passed on. Behind it\ncame another of the same form, with another aged man enthroned, who,\nstopping the cart, said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first,\n\"I am the sage Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown,\" and\npassed on. Then another cart came by at the same pace, but the occupant\nof the throne was not old like the others, but a man stalwart and robust,\nand of a forbidding countenance, who as he came up said in a voice far\nhoarser and more devilish, \"I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal\nenemy of Amadis of Gaul and all his kindred,\" and then passed on. Having\ngone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise of\ntheir wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, but\nsound of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking\nit to be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not\nstir a step, or for a single instant, \"Senora, where there's music there\ncan't be mischief.\"\n\n\"Nor where there are lights and it is bright,\" said the duchess; to which\nSancho replied, \"Fire gives light, and it's bright where there are\nbonfires, as we see by those that are all round us and perhaps may burn\nus; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Don Quixote, who was listening to all\nthat passed; and he was right, as is shown in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THE\nDISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS\n\n\nThey saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music,\nwhat they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linen\nhousings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white,\nwith a large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twice or,\nperhaps, three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the\nsides stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with\nlighted tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and on a\nraised throne was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver-tissue\nveils with an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over\nthem, that made her appear, if not richly, at least brilliantly,\napparelled. She had her face covered with thin transparent sendal, the\ntexture of which did not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being\ndistinguished, while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her\nbeauty and of her years, which seemed to be not less than seventeen but\nnot to have yet reached twenty. Beside her was a figure in a robe of\nstate, as they call it, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered\nwith a black veil. But the instant the car was opposite the duke and\nduchess and Don Quixote the music of the clarions ceased, and then that\nof the lutes and harps on the car, and the figure in the robe rose up,\nand flinging it apart and removing the veil from its face, disclosed to\ntheir eyes the shape of Death itself, fleshless and hideous, at which\nsight Don Quixote felt uneasy, Sancho frightened, and the duke and\nduchess displayed a certain trepidation. Having risen to its feet, this\nliving death, in a sleepy voice and with a tongue hardly awake, held\nforth as follows:\n\nI am that Merlin who the legends say\nThe devil had for father, and the lie\nHath gathered credence with the lapse of time.\nOf magic prince, of Zoroastric lore\nMonarch and treasurer, with jealous eye\nI view the efforts of the age to hide\nThe gallant deeds of doughty errant knights,\nWho are, and ever have been, dear to me.\n  Enchanters and magicians and their kind\n\nAre mostly hard of heart; not so am I;\nFor mine is tender, soft, compassionate,\nAnd its delight is doing good to all.\nIn the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis,\nWhere, tracing mystic lines and characters,\nMy soul abideth now, there came to me\nThe sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,\nThe peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\nI knew of her enchantment and her fate,\nFrom high-born dame to peasant wench transformed\nAnd touched with pity, first I turned the leaves\nOf countless volumes of my devilish craft,\nAnd then, in this grim grisly skeleton\nMyself encasing, hither have I come\nTo show where lies the fitting remedy\nTo give relief in such a piteous case.\n  O thou, the pride and pink of all that  I wear\n\nThe adamantine steel! O shining light,\nO beacon, polestar, path and guide of all\nWho, scorning slumber and the lazy down,\nAdopt the toilsome life of bloodstained arms!\nTo thee, great hero who all praise transcends,\nLa Mancha's lustre and Iberia's star,\nDon Quixote, wise as brave, to thee I say--\nFor peerless Dulcinea del Toboso\nHer pristine form and beauty to regain,\n'T is needful that thy esquire Sancho shall,\nOn his own sturdy buttocks bared to heaven,\nThree thousand and three hundred lashes lay,\nAnd that they smart and sting and hurt him well.\nThus have the authors of her woe resolved.\nAnd this is, gentles, wherefore I have come.\n\n\"By all that's good,\" exclaimed Sancho at this, \"I'll just as soon give\nmyself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand,\nlashes. The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don't see what my\nbackside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Senor Merlin has not\nfound out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea del Toboso,\nshe may go to her grave enchanted.\"\n\n\"But I'll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth,\nand give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand\nsix hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won't be got rid of if\nyou try three thousand three hundred times; don't answer me a word or\nI'll tear your soul out.\"\n\nOn hearing this Merlin said, \"That will not do, for the lashes worthy\nSancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not by\nforce, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no fixed limit\nassigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to commute by half\nthe pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand of another,\nthough it may be somewhat weighty.\"\n\n\"Not a hand, my own or anybody else's, weighty or weighable, shall touch\nme,\" said Sancho. \"Was it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcinea del\nToboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes? My master,\nindeed, that's a part of her--for, he's always calling her 'my life' and\n'my soul,' and his stay and prop--may and ought to whip himself for her\nand take all the trouble required for her disenchantment. But for me to\nwhip myself! Abernuncio!\"\n\nAs soon as Sancho had done speaking the nymph in silver that was at the\nside of Merlin's ghost stood up, and removing the thin veil from her face\ndisclosed one that seemed to all something more than exceedingly\nbeautiful; and with a masculine freedom from embarrassment and in a voice\nnot very like a lady's, addressing Sancho directly, said, \"Thou wretched\nsquire, soul of a pitcher, heart of a cork tree, with bowels of flint and\npebbles; if, thou impudent thief, they bade thee throw thyself down from\nsome lofty tower; if, enemy of mankind, they asked thee to swallow a\ndozen of toads, two of lizards, and three of adders; if they wanted thee\nto slay thy wife and children with a sharp murderous scimitar, it would\nbe no wonder for thee to show thyself stubborn and squeamish. But to make\na piece of work about three thousand three hundred lashes, what every\npoor little charity-boy gets every month--it is enough to amaze,\nastonish, astound the compassionate bowels of all who hear it, nay, all\nwho come to hear it in the course of time. Turn, O miserable,\nhard-hearted animal, turn, I say, those timorous owl's eyes upon these of\nmine that are compared to radiant stars, and thou wilt see them weeping\ntrickling streams and rills, and tracing furrows, tracks, and paths over\nthe fair fields of my cheeks. Let it move thee, crafty, ill-conditioned\nmonster, to see my blooming youth--still in its teens, for I am not yet\ntwenty--wasting and withering away beneath the husk of a rude peasant\nwench; and if I do not appear in that shape now, it is a special favour\nSenor Merlin here has granted me, to the sole end that my beauty may\nsoften thee; for the tears of beauty in distress turn rocks into cotton\nand tigers into ewes. Lay on to that hide of thine, thou great untamed\nbrute, rouse up thy lusty vigour that only urges thee to eat and eat, and\nset free the softness of my flesh, the gentleness of my nature, and the\nfairness of my face. And if thou wilt not relent or come to reason for\nme, do so for the sake of that poor knight thou hast beside thee; thy\nmaster I mean, whose soul I can this moment see, how he has it stuck in\nhis throat not ten fingers from his lips, and only waiting for thy\ninflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or go back\nagain into his stomach.\"\n\nDon Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke he\nsaid, \"By God, senor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck here in my\nthroat like the nut of a crossbow.\"\n\n\"What say you to this, Sancho?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"I say, senora,\" returned Sancho, \"what I said before; as for the lashes,\nabernuncio!\"\n\n\"Abrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,\" said the duke.\n\n\"Let me alone, your highness,\" said Sancho. \"I'm not in a humour now to\nlook into niceties or a letter more or less, for these lashes that are to\nbe given me, or I'm to give myself, have so upset me, that I don't know\nwhat I'm saying or doing. But I'd like to know of this lady, my lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, where she learned this way she has of asking\nfavours. She comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and she calls\nme soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string of foul names\nthat the devil is welcome to. Is my flesh brass? or is it anything to me\nwhether she is enchanted or not? Does she bring with her a basket of fair\nlinen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks-not that wear any--to coax me? No,\nnothing but one piece of abuse after another, though she knows the\nproverb they have here that 'an ass loaded with gold goes lightly up a\nmountain,' and that 'gifts break rocks,' and 'praying to God and plying\nthe hammer,' and that 'one \"take\" is better than two \"I'll give thee's.\"'\nThen there's my master, who ought to stroke me down and pet me to make me\nturn wool and carded cotton; he says if he gets hold of me he'll tie me\nnaked to a tree and double the tale of lashes on me. These tender-hearted\ngentry should consider that it's not merely a squire, but a governor they\nare asking to whip himself; just as if it was 'drink with cherries.' Let\nthem learn, plague take them, the right way to ask, and beg, and behave\nthemselves; for all times are not alike, nor are people always in good\nhumour. I'm now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn,\nand they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I having as\nlittle fancy for it as for turning cacique.\"\n\n\"Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,\" said the duke, \"that unless you\nbecome softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get hold of the government.\nIt would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders a cruel governor\nwith flinty bowels, who won't yield to the tears of afflicted damsels or\nto the prayers of wise, magisterial, ancient enchanters and sages. In\nshort, Sancho, either you must be whipped by yourself, or they must whip\nyou, or you shan't be governor.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"won't two days' grace be given me in which to\nconsider what is best for me?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" said Merlin; \"here, this minute, and on the spot,\nthe matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave of\nMontesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or else in her\npresent form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she will\nremain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.\"\n\n\"Now then, Sancho!\" said the duchess, \"show courage, and gratitude for\nyour master Don Quixote's bread that you have eaten; we are all bound to\noblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry.\nConsent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the devil, and leave\nfear to milksops, for 'a stout heart breaks bad luck,' as you very well\nknow.\"\n\nTo this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing\nMerlin, he made to him, \"Will your worship tell me, Senor Merlin--when\nthat courier devil came up he gave my master a message from Senor\nMontesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to\narrange how the lady Dona Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted; but\nup to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like him.\"\n\nTo which Merlin made answer, \"The devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and a\ngreat scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with a\nmessage from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his cave\nexpecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment; for\nthere's the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you anything, or\nyou have any business to transact with him, I'll bring him to you and put\nhim where you choose; but for the present make up your mind to consent to\nthis penance, and believe me it will be very good for you, for soul as\nwell for body--for your soul because of the charity with which you\nperform it, for your body because I know that you are of a sanguine habit\nand it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.\"\n\n\"There are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters are\ndoctors,\" said Sancho; \"however, as everybody tells me the same\nthing--though I can't see it myself--I say I am willing to give myself\nthe three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I am to lay them on\nwhenever I like, without any fixing of days or times; and I'll try and\nget out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world may enjoy the beauty\nof the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems, contrary to what I thought,\nthat she is beautiful after all. It must be a condition, too, that I am\nnot to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that if any of the\nlashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count. Item, that, in case I\nshould make any mistake in the reckoning, Senor Merlin, as he knows\neverything, is to keep count, and let me know how many are still wanting\nor over the number.\"\n\n\"There will be no need to let you know of any over,\" said Merlin,\n\"because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcinea will at once,\nand that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in her gratitude to\nseek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even reward him for the\ngood work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too many or\ntoo few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair of his head.\"\n\n\"Well then, in God's hands be it,\" said Sancho; \"in the hard case I'm in\nI give in; I say I accept the penance on the conditions laid down.\"\n\nThe instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions\nstruck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and Don\nQuixote hung on Sancho's neck kissing him again and again on the forehead\nand cheeks. The duchess and the duke expressed the greatest satisfaction,\nthe car began to move on, and as it passed the fair Dulcinea bowed to the\nduke and duchess and made a low curtsey to Sancho.\n\nAnd now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field,\nrevived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks,\nmurmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tribute\nto the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the fresh\nbreeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day that came\ntreading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright. The duke and\nduchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so\ncleverly and successfully, returned to their castle resolved to follow up\ntheir joke; for to them there was no reality that could afford them more\namusement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE\nDISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTER\nWHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA\n\n\nThe duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and he it\nwas that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements for the\nlate adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to represent\nDulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his master and mistress, he got\nup another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be\nimagined.\n\nThe duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with his\npenance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.\nHe said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight.\n\nThe duchess asked him what he had given them with.\n\nHe said with his hand.\n\n\"That,\" said the duchess, \"is more like giving oneself slaps than lashes;\nI am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with such tenderness;\nworthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a cat-o'-nine tails,\nthat will make itself felt; for it's with blood that letters enter, and\nthe release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not be granted so\ncheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho, that works of\ncharity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are without merit and of\nno avail.\"\n\nTo which Sancho replied, \"If your ladyship will give me a proper scourge\nor cord, I'll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too much; for you\nmust know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp, and it won't\ndo for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else.\"\n\n\"So be it by all means,\" said the duchess; \"tomorrow I'll give you a\nscourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate itself\nto the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.\"\n\nThen said Sancho, \"Your highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that I\nhave a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an account of\nall that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in my bosom,\nand there's nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I'd be glad if\nyour discretion would read it, for I think it runs in the governor style;\nI mean the way governors ought to write.\"\n\n\"And who dictated it?\" asked the duchess.\n\n\"Who should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"And did you write it yourself?\" said the duchess.\n\n\"That I didn't,\" said Sancho; \"for I can neither read nor write, though I\ncan sign my name.\"\n\n\"Let us see it,\" said the duchess, \"for never fear but you display in it\nthe quality and quantity of your wit.\"\n\nSancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, taking\nit, found it ran in this fashion:\n\n\nSANCHO PANZA'S LETTER TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA\n\nIf I was well whipped I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got a\ngood government it is at the cost of a good whipping. Thou wilt not\nunderstand this just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it\nmeans. I may tell thee, Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that is\na matter of importance, because every other way of going is going on\nall-fours. Thou art a governor's wife; take care that nobody speaks evil\nof thee behind thy back. I send thee here a green hunting suit that my\nlady the duchess gave me; alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice\nfor our daughter. Don Quixote, my master, if I am to believe what I hear\nin these parts, is a madman of some sense, and a droll blockhead, and I\nam no way behind him. We have been in the cave of Montesinos, and the\nsage Merlin has laid hold of me for the disenchantment of Dulcinea del\nToboso, her that is called Aldonza Lorenzo over there. With three\nthousand three hundred lashes, less five, that I'm to give myself, she\nwill be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that bore her. Say\nnothing of this to anyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some will\nsay they are white and others will say they are black. I shall leave this\nin a few days for my government, to which I am going with a mighty great\ndesire to make money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the\nsame desire; I will feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou\nart to come and live with me or not. Dapple is well and sends many\nremembrances to thee; I am not going to leave him behind though they took\nme away to be Grand Turk. My lady the duchess kisses thy hands a thousand\ntimes; do thou make a return with two thousand, for as my master says,\nnothing costs less or is cheaper than civility. God has not been pleased\nto provide another valise for me with another hundred crowns, like the\none the other day; but never mind, my Teresa, the bell-ringer is in safe\nquarters, and all will come out in the scouring of the government; only\nit troubles me greatly what they tell me--that once I have tasted it I\nwill eat my hands off after it; and if that is so it will not come very\ncheap to me; though to be sure the maimed have a benefice of their own in\nthe alms they beg for; so that one way or another thou wilt be rich and\nin luck. God give it to thee as he can, and keep me to serve thee. From\nthis castle, the 20th of July, 1614.\n\nThy husband, the governor.\n\nSANCHO PANZA\n\n\nWhen she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, \"On two\npoints the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or\nhinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes\nthat he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that\nwhen my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a\nthing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very\ncovetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for 'covetousness\nbursts the bag,' and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.\"\n\n\"I don't mean it that way, senora,\" said Sancho; \"and if you think the\nletter doesn't run as it ought to do, it's only to tear it up and make\nanother; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said the duchess, \"this one will do, and I wish the duke to see\nit.\"\n\nWith this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and\nthe duchess showed Sancho's letter to the duke, who was highly delighted\nwith it. They dined, and after the cloth had been removed and they had\namused themselves for a while with Sancho's rich conversation, the\nmelancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drum made itself heard.\nAll seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused, martial harmony,\nespecially Don Quixote, who could not keep his seat from pure\ndisquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove him to\nhis usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed and\nin truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one.\nWhile they were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them\nthrough the garden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing\nthat they trailed upon the ground. As they marched they beat two great\ndrums which were likewise draped in black, and beside them came the fife\nplayer, black and sombre like the others. Following these came a\npersonage of gigantic stature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of the\ndeepest black, the skirt of which was of prodigious dimensions. Over the\ngown, girdling or crossing his figure, he had a broad baldric which was\nalso black, and from which hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and\nfurniture. He had his face covered with a transparent black veil, through\nwhich might be descried a very long beard as white as snow. He came on\nkeeping step to the sound of the drums with great gravity and dignity;\nand, in short, his stature, his gait, the sombreness of his appearance\nand his following might well have struck with astonishment, as they did,\nall who beheld him without knowing who he was. With this measured pace\nand in this guise he advanced to kneel before the duke, who, with the\nothers, awaited him standing. The duke, however, would not on any account\nallow him to speak until he had risen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed,\nand standing up, removed the veil from his face and disclosed the most\nenormous, the longest, the whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes\nhad ever beheld until that moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous\nvoice from the depths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes\non the duke, he said:\n\n\"Most high and mighty senor, my name is Trifaldin of the White Beard; I\nam squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed\nDuenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness, which is that\nyour magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave and permission to\ncome and tell you her trouble, which is one of the strangest and most\nwonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the world could\nhave imagined; but first she desires to know if the valiant and never\nvanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is in this your castle, for\nshe has come in quest of him on foot and without breaking her fast from\nthe kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; a thing which may and ought to\nbe regarded as a miracle or set down to enchantment; she is even now at\nthe gate of this fortress or plaisance, and only waits for your\npermission to enter. I have spoken.\" And with that he coughed, and\nstroked down his beard with both his hands, and stood very tranquilly\nwaiting for the response of the duke, which was to this effect: \"Many\ndays ago, worthy squire Trifaldin of the White Beard, we heard of the\nmisfortune of my lady the Countess Trifaldi, whom the enchanters have\ncaused to be called the Distressed Duenna. Bid her enter, O stupendous\nsquire, and tell her that the valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha is\nhere, and from his generous disposition she may safely promise herself\nevery protection and assistance; and you may tell her, too, that if my\naid be necessary it will not be withheld, for I am bound to give it to\nher by my quality of knight, which involves the protection of women of\nall sorts, especially widowed, wronged, and distressed dames, such as her\nladyship seems to be.\"\n\nOn hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a sign\nto the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched out of the\ngarden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he entered, leaving\nthem all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turning to Don Quixote, the\nduke said, \"After all, renowned knight, the mists of malice and ignorance\nare unable to hide or obscure the light of valour and virtue. I say so,\nbecause your excellence has been barely six days in this castle, and\nalready the unhappy and the afflicted come in quest of you from lands far\ndistant and remote, and not in coaches or on dromedaries, but on foot and\nfasting, confident that in that mighty arm they will find a cure for\ntheir sorrows and troubles; thanks to your great achievements, which are\ncirculated all over the known earth.\"\n\n\"I wish, senor duke,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that blessed ecclesiastic,\nwho at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitter spite against\nknights-errant, were here now to see with his own eyes whether knights of\nthe sort are needed in the world; he would at any rate learn by\nexperience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction or sorrow,\nin extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for a remedy\nto the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to the knight who has\nnever attempted to pass the bounds of his own town, or to the indolent\ncourtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of, instead of\nstriving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and record. Relief\nin distress, help in need, protection for damsels, consolation for\nwidows, are to be found in no sort of persons better than in\nknights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am one, and\nregard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the pursuit of\nso honourable a calling as endured to good purpose. Let this duenna come\nand ask what she will, for I will effect her relief by the might of my\narm and the dauntless resolution of my bold heart.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA\n\n\nThe duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixote\nfell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, \"I hope\nthis senora duenna won't be putting any difficulties in the way of the\npromise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, who\ntalked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing\ngood could happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same apothecary!\nAnd so what I'm thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort or\ncondition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must they be that\nare distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or Three-tails!--for in\nmy country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it's all one.\"\n\n\"Hush, friend Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"since this lady duenna comes in\nquest of me from such a distant land she cannot be one of those the\napothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and when countesses serve\nas duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses, for in their own\nhouses they are mistresses paramount and have other duennas to wait on\nthem.\"\n\nTo this Dona Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, \"My lady the\nduchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was the\nwill of fortune; 'but laws go as kings like;' let nobody speak ill of\nduennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not one\nmyself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over one\nthat is a widow; but 'he who clipped us has kept the scissors.'\"\n\n\"For all that,\" said Sancho, \"there's so much to be clipped about\nduennas, so my barber said, that 'it will be better not to stir the rice\neven though it sticks.'\"\n\n\"These squires,\" returned Dona Rodriguez, \"are always our enemies; and as\nthey are the haunting spirits of the antechambers and watch us at every\nstep, whenever they are not saying their prayers (and that's often\nenough) they spend their time in tattling about us, digging up our bones\nand burying our good name. But I can tell these walking blocks that we\nwill live in spite of them, and in great houses too, though we die of\nhunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not, with widow's weeds, as\none covers or hides a dunghill on a procession day. By my faith, if it\nwere permitted me and time allowed, I could prove, not only to those here\npresent, but to all the world, that there is no virtue that is not to be\nfound in a duenna.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" said the duchess, \"that my good Dona Rodriguez is\nright, and very much so; but she had better bide her time for fighting\nher own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as to crush the\ncalumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice in the great\nSancho Panza's mind.\"\n\nTo which Sancho replied, \"Ever since I have sniffed the governorship I\nhave got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don't care a wild fig for\nall the duennas in the world.\"\n\nThey would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heard\nthe notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded that\nthe Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. The duchess asked the duke\nif it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess and\na person of rank.\n\n\"In respect of her being a countess,\" said Sancho, before the duke could\nreply, \"I am for your highnesses going out to receive her; but in respect\nof her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should not stir a step.\"\n\n\"Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Who, senor?\" said Sancho; \"I meddle for I have a right to meddle, as a\nsquire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your\nworship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of\ncourtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, as\nmuch is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one who has\nhis ears open, few words.\"\n\n\"Sancho is right,\" said the duke; \"we'll see what the countess is like,\nand by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.\"\n\nAnd now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the\nauthor brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, following\nup the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nWHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA'S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES\n\n\nFollowing the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as\ntwelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes\napparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that\nthey allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the\nCountess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by\nthe hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a\nnap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail,\nor skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which\nwere borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning,\nforming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by\nthe three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that\nit must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it\nwere Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that\nby her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred\nin great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been\nfoxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the\ncustom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing\nor things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in\nhonour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up\nTrifaldi.\n\nThe twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces\nbeing covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin's,\nbut so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon\nas the band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and Don\nQuixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-moving\nprocession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which the\nDistressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On seeing this\nthe duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward to\nmeet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse and\nrough, rather than fine and delicate, \"May it please your highnesses not\nto offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to this your\nhandmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able to make a\nproper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune has carried\noff my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long way off, for\nthe more I look for them the less I find them.\"\n\n\"He would be wanting in wits, senora countess,\" said the duke, \"who did\nnot perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance it may be seen it\ndeserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of polite usage;\" and\nraising her up by the hand he led her to a seat beside the duchess, who\nlikewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixote remained silent,\nwhile Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldi and one or two of\nher many duennas; but there was no possibility of it until they\nthemselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.\n\nAll kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which the\nDistressed Duenna did in these words: \"I am confident, most mighty lord,\nmost fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserable misery\nwill be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generous and\ncondolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough to\nmelt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardened\nhearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to say\nyour ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in this\nsociety, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote de\nla Manchissima, and his squirissimus Panza.\"\n\n\"The Panza is here,\" said Sancho, before anyone could reply, \"and Don\nQuixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima, you may say\nwhat you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you any\nservissimus.\"\n\nOn this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said, \"If\nyour sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relief from the\nvalour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which, feeble and\nlimited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to your service. I am\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid to the needy of\nall sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you, senora, to\nmake any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only to tell your\nwoes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers that will know\nhow, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.\"\n\nOn hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throw\nherself at Don Quixote's feet, and actually did fall before them and\nsaid, as she strove to embrace them, \"Before these feet and legs I cast\nmyself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, the foundations\nand pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss, for upon\ntheir steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune, O\nvalorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipse\nthe fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!\" Then\nturning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, she\nsaid, \"O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant in this\npresent age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than the beard\nof Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boast thyself\nthat, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summed up in\none, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in the world. I\nconjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, that thou\nwilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he speedily give\naid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.\"\n\nTo this Sancho made answer, \"As to my goodness, senora, being as long and\nas great as your squire's beard, it matters very little to me; may I have\nmy soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quit this life,\nthat's the point; about beards here below I care little or nothing; but\nwithout all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg my master (for I\nknow he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just now for a certain\nbusiness) to help and aid your worship as far as he can; unpack your woes\nand lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them, for we'll be all\nof one mind.\"\n\nThe duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of this\nadventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and between\nthemselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who,\nreturning to her seat, said, \"Queen Dona Maguncia reigned over the famous\nkingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and the Southern\nSea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of King\nArchipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue\nthe Princess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess\nAntonomasia was reared and brought up under my care and direction, I\nbeing the oldest and highest in rank of her mother's duennas. Time\npassed, and the young Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a\nperfection of beauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it\nmust not be supposed her intelligence was childish; she was as\nintelligent as she was fair, and she was fairer than all the world; and\nis so still, unless the envious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have\ncut for her the thread of life. But that they have not, for Heaven will\nnot suffer so great a wrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the\ngrapes of the fairest vineyard on its surface. Of this beauty, to which\nmy poor feeble tongue has failed to do justice, countless princes, not\nonly of that country, but of others, were enamoured, and among them a\nprivate gentleman, who was at the court, dared to raise his thoughts to\nthe heaven of so great beauty, trusting to his youth, his gallant\nbearing, his numerous accomplishments and graces, and his quickness and\nreadiness of wit; for I may tell your highnesses, if I am not wearying\nyou, that he played the guitar so as to make it speak, and he was,\nbesides, a poet and a great dancer, and he could make birdcages so well,\nthat by making them alone he might have gained a livelihood, had he found\nhimself reduced to utter poverty; and gifts and graces of this kind are\nenough to bring down a mountain, not to say a tender young girl. But all\nhis gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all his graces and accomplishments, would\nhave been of little or no avail towards gaining the fortress of my pupil,\nhad not the impudent thief taken the precaution of gaining me over first.\nFirst, the villain and heartless vagabond sought to win my good-will and\npurchase my compliance, so as to get me, like a treacherous warder, to\ndeliver up to him the keys of the fortress I had in charge. In a word, he\ngained an influence over my mind, and overcame my resolutions with I know\nnot what trinkets and jewels he gave me; but it was some verses I heard\nhim singing one night from a grating that opened on the street where he\nlived, that, more than anything else, made me give way and led to my\nfall; and if I remember rightly they ran thus:\n\n  From that sweet enemy of mine\n  My bleeding heart hath had its wound;\n  And to increase the pain I'm bound\n  To suffer and to make no sign.\n\nThe lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; and\nafterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune into\nwhich I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought\nto be banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones,\nfor they write verses, not like those of 'The Marquis of Mantua,' that\ndelight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointed\nconceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightning\nstrike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:\n\n  Come Death, so subtly veiled that I\n  Thy coming know not, how or when,\n  Lest it should give me life again\n  To find how sweet it is to die.\n\n--and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when\nsung and fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to\ncompose a sort of verse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which\nthey call seguidillas! Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks\nforth, and the body grows restless and all the senses turn quicksilver.\nAnd so I say, sirs, that these troubadours richly deserve to be banished\nto the isles of the lizards. Though it is not they that are in fault, but\nthe simpletons that extol them, and the fools that believe in them; and\nhad I been the faithful duenna I should have been, his stale conceits\nwould have never moved me, nor should I have been taken in by such\nphrases as 'in death I live,' 'in ice I burn,' 'in flames I shiver,'\n'hopeless I hope,' 'I go and stay,' and paradoxes of that sort which\ntheir writings are full of. And then when they promise the Phoenix of\nArabia, the crown of Ariadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the\nSouth, the gold of Tibar, and the balsam of Panchaia! Then it is they\ngive a loose to their pens, for it costs them little to make promises\nthey have no intention or power of fulfilling. But where am I wandering\nto? Woe is me, unfortunate being! What madness or folly leads me to speak\nof the faults of others, when there is so much to be said about my own?\nAgain, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was not verses that conquered me,\nbut my own simplicity; it was not music made me yield, but my own\nimprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution opened the way and\ncleared the path for Don Clavijo's advances, for that was the name of the\ngentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between, he\nfound his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia\n(deceived not by him but by me) under the title of a lawful husband; for,\nsinner though I was, would not have allowed him to approach the edge of\nher shoe-sole without being her husband. No, no, not that; marriage must\ncome first in any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there\nwas one hitch in this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don\nClavijo being a private gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I\nsaid, heiress to the kingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a\nsecret, kept hidden by my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a\ncertain expansion of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it,\nthe dread of which made us all there take counsel together, and it was\nagreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand\nAntonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to\nmarry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding\nterms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary\nsteps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady's\nconfession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into the\ncustody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.\"\n\n\"Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,\" said Sancho at this,\n\"and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is the same all\nover! But make haste, Senora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I am dying to\nknow the end of this long story.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied the countess.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nIN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORY\n\n\nBy every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as\nDon Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, and\nthe Distressed One went on to say: \"At length, after much questioning and\nanswering, as the princess held to her story, without changing or varying\nher previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decision in favour of Don\nClavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife; which the\nQueen Dona Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia's mother, so took to heart,\nthat within the space of three days we buried her.\"\n\n\"She died, no doubt,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Trifaldin; \"they don't bury living people in Kandy,\nonly the dead.\"\n\n\"Senor Squire,\" said Sancho, \"a man in a swoon has been known to be\nburied before now, in the belief that he was dead; and it struck me that\nQueen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died; because with life\na great many things come right, and the princess's folly was not so great\nthat she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had married some page of\nhers, or some other servant of the house, as many another has done, so I\nhave heard say, then the mischief would have been past curing. But to\nmarry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now\ndescribed to us--indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was not such a\ngreat one as you think; for according to the rules of my master here--and\nhe won't allow me to lie--as of men of letters bishops are made, so of\ngentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings and emperors may be\nmade.\"\n\n\"Thou art right, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for with a knight-errant, if\nhe has but two fingers' breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards to\nbecome the mightiest lord on earth. But let senora the Distressed One\nproceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part of this\nso far sweet story.\"\n\n\"The bitter is indeed to come,\" said the countess; \"and such bitter that\ncolocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The queen, then,\nbeing dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly had we covered\nher with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells, when, quis talia\nfando temperet a lachrymis? over the queen's grave there appeared,\nmounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno, Maguncia's first\ncousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and he, to revenge the\ndeath of his cousin, punish the audacity of Don Clavijo, and in wrath at\nthe contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both enchanted by his art on the\ngrave itself; she being changed into an ape of brass, and he into a\nhorrible crocodile of some unknown metal; while between the two there\nstands a pillar, also of metal, with certain characters in the Syriac\nlanguage inscribed upon it, which, being translated into Kandian, and now\ninto Castilian, contain the following sentence: 'These two rash lovers\nshall not recover their former shape until the valiant Manchegan comes to\ndo battle with me in single combat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled\nadventure for his mighty valour alone.' This done, he drew from its\nsheath a huge broad scimitar, and seizing me by the hair he made as\nthough he meant to cut my throat and shear my head clean off. I was\nterror-stricken, my voice stuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest\ndistress; nevertheless I summoned up my strength as well as I could, and\nin a trembling and piteous voice I addressed such words to him as induced\nhim to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused all\nthe duennas of the palace, those that are here present, to be brought\nbefore him; and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and\ndenounced duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues,\nlaying to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would\nnot visit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature\nwhich would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he\nceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking\nus, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our hands up to our\nfaces and found ourselves in the state you now see.\"\n\nHere the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with which\nthey were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards,\nsome red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectacle\nthe duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder. Don Quixote\nand Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost in\nastonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say: \"Thus did that\nmalevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness and\nsoftness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would to heaven that he\nhad swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring\nthe light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us! For\nif we look into the matter, sirs (and what I am now going to say I would\nsay with eyes flowing like fountains, only that the thought of our\nmisfortune and the oceans they have already wept, keep them as dry as\nbarley spears, and so I say it without tears), where, I ask, can a duenna\nwith a beard to to? What father or mother will feel pity for her? Who\nwill help her? For, if even when she has a smooth skin, and a face\ntortured by a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get\nanybody to love her, what will she do when she shows a countenace turned\ninto a thicket? Oh duennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment\nwhen we were born and an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!\" And\nas she said this she showed signs of being about to faint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nOF MATTERS RELATING AND BELONGING TO THIS ADVENTURE AND TO THIS MEMORABLE\nHISTORY\n\n\nVerily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this ought\nshow their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for the\nscrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minute particulars,\nnot leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that he does not make\nclear and plain. He portrays the thoughts, he reveals the fancies, he\nanswers implied questions, clears up doubts, sets objections at rest,\nand, in a word, makes plain the smallest points the most inquisitive can\ndesire to know. O renowned author! O happy Don Quixote! O famous famous\ndroll Sancho! All and each, may ye live countless ages for the delight\nand amusement of the dwellers on earth!\n\nThe history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed One faint\nhe exclaimed: \"I swear by the faith of an honest man and the shades of\nall my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of, nor has my\nmaster related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure as this. A\nthousand devils--not to curse thee--take thee, Malambruno, for an\nenchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishment for\nthese sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better--it would\nhave been better for them--to have taken off half their noses from the\nmiddle upwards, even though they'd have snuffled when they spoke, than to\nhave put beards on them? I'll bet they have not the means of paying\nanybody to shave them.\"\n\n\"That is the truth, senor,\" said one of the twelve; \"we have not the\nmoney to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us, taken to using\nsticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for by applying them to\nour faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are left as bare and\nsmooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure, women in\nKandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and trim\neyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the\nduennas of my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a\nflavour of agents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not\nrelieved by Senor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with\nbeards.\"\n\n\"I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,\" said Don Quixote, \"if\nI don't cure yours.\"\n\nAt this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, \"The\nchink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of my\nswoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses;\nand so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable sir, to\nlet your gracious promises be turned into deeds.\"\n\n\"There shall be no delay on my part,\" said Don Quixote. \"Bethink you,\nsenora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" replied the Distressed One, \"it is five thousand leagues,\na couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, if you go by\nland; but if you go through the air and in a straight line, it is three\nthousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know, too, that\nMalambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our deliverer,\nhe himself would send him a steed far better and with less tricks than a\npost-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on which the valiant\nPierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said horse is guided by a\npeg he has in his forehead that serves for a bridle, and flies through\nthe air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devils were\ncarrying him. This horse, according to ancient tradition, was made by\nMerlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was a friend of his, and who made\nlong journeys with him, and, as has been said, carried off the fair\nMagalona, bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who\nbeheld them from the earth gape with astonishment; and he never lent him\nsave to those whom he loved or those who paid him well; and since the\ngreat Pierres we know of no one having mounted him until now. From him\nMalambruno stole him by his magic art, and he has him now in his\npossession, and makes use of him in his journeys which he constantly\nmakes through different parts of the world; he is here to-day, to-morrow\nin France, and the next day in Potosi; and the best of it is the said\nhorse neither eats nor sleeps nor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling\npace through the air without wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon\nhim can carry a cup full of water in his hand without spilling a drop, so\nsmoothly and easily does he go, for which reason the fair Magalona\nenjoyed riding him greatly.\"\n\n\"For going smoothly and easily,\" said Sancho at this, \"give me my Dapple,\nthough he can't go through the air; but on the ground I'll back him\nagainst all the amblers in the world.\"\n\nThey all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: \"And this same horse,\nif so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our sufferings,\nwill be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half an hour;\nfor he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby I might\nknow that I had found the knight I was in quest of, would be to send me\nthe horse wherever he might be, speedily and promptly.\"\n\n\"And how many is there room for on this horse?\" asked Sancho.\n\n\"Two,\" said the Distressed One, \"one in the saddle, and the other on the\ncroup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there is no\ndamsel that's being carried off.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know, Senora Distressed One,\" said Sancho, \"what is the name\nof this horse?\"\n\n\"His name,\" said the Distressed One, \"is not the same as Bellerophon's\nhorse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great's, called\nBucephalus, or Orlando Furioso's, the name of which was Brigliador, nor\nyet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino like\nRuggiero's, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sun were\ncalled, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on which the unfortunate\nRodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battle where he lost his\nlife and his kingdom.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" said Sancho, \"that as they have given him none of these\nfamous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him the name\nof my master's Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that have\nbeen mentioned.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the bearded countess, \"still it fits him very well,\nfor he is called Clavileno the Swift, which name is in accordance with\nhis being made of wood, with the peg he has in his forehead, and with the\nswift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as name goes, he may\ncompare with the famous Rocinante.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say against his name,\" said Sancho; \"but with what\nsort of bridle or halter is he managed?\"\n\n\"I have said already,\" said the Trifaldi, \"that it is with a peg, by\nturning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makes him\ngo as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming and almost\nsweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is sought and\nfollowed in all well-regulated proceedings.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see him,\" said Sancho; \"but to fancy I'm going to mount him,\neither in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elm tree. A\ngood joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seat upon Dapple, and on a\npack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they'd have me hold on upon\nhaunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort! Gad, I have no\nnotion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone's beard; let each one\nshave himself as best he can; I'm not going to accompany my master on any\nsuch long journey; besides, I can't give any help to the shaving of these\nbeards as I can to the disenchantment of my lady Dulcinea.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can, my friend,\" replied the Trifaldi; \"and so much, that\nwithout you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.\"\n\n\"In the king's name!\" exclaimed Sancho, \"what have squires got to do with\nthe adventures of their masters? Are they to have the fame of such as\nthey go through, and we the labour? Body o' me! if the historians would\nonly say, 'Such and such a knight finished such and such an adventure,\nbut with the help of so and so, his squire, without which it would have\nbeen impossible for him to accomplish it;' but they write curtly, \"Don\nParalipomenon of the Three Stars accomplished the adventure of the six\nmonsters;' without mentioning such a person as his squire, who was there\nall the time, just as if there was no such being. Once more, sirs, I say\nmy master may go alone, and much good may it do him; and I'll stay here\nin the company of my lady the duchess; and maybe when he comes back, he\nwill find the lady Dulcinea's affair ever so much advanced; for I mean in\nleisure hours, and at idle moments, to give myself a spell of whipping\nwithout so much as a hair to cover me.\"\n\n\"For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,\" said the\nduchess, \"for they are worthy folk who ask you; and the faces of these\nladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idle fears;\nthat would be a hard case indeed.\"\n\n\"In the king's name, once more!\" said Sancho; \"If this charitable work\nwere to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or charity-girls,\na man might expose himself to some hardships; but to bear it for the sake\nof stripping beards off duennas! Devil take it! I'd sooner see them all\nbearded, from the highest to the lowest, and from the most prudish to the\nmost affected.\"\n\n\"You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,\" said the duchess; \"you\nincline very much to the opinion of the Toledo apothecary. But indeed you\nare wrong; there are duennas in my house that may serve as patterns of\nduennas; and here is my Dona Rodriguez, who will not allow me to say\notherwise.\"\n\n\"Your excellence may say it if you like,\" said the Rodriguez; \"for God\nknows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are good or bad,\nbearded or smooth, we are our mothers' daughters like other women; and as\nGod sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and on his mercy I rely,\nand not on anybody's beard.\"\n\n\"Well, Senora Rodriguez, Senora Trifaldi, and present company,\" said Don\nQuixote, \"I trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon your\ntroubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only let Clavileno come and\nlet me find myself face to face with Malambruno, and I am certain no\nrazor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shave Malambruno's\nhead off his shoulders; for 'God bears with the wicked, but not for\never.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the Distressed One at this, \"may all the stars of the\ncelestial regions look down upon your greatness with benign eyes, valiant\nknight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon your heart, that it may\nbe the shield and safeguard of the abused and downtrodden race of\nduennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at by squires, and made game\nof by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flower of her youth would\nnot sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunate beings that we are, we\nduennas! Though we may be descended in the direct male line from Hector\nof Troy himself, our mistresses never fail to address us as 'you' if they\nthink it makes queens of them. O giant Malambruno, though thou art an\nenchanter, thou art true to thy promises. Send us now the peerless\nClavileno, that our misfortune may be brought to an end; for if the hot\nweather sets in and these beards of ours are still there, alas for our\nlot!\"\n\nThe Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from\nthe eyes of all and even Sancho's filled up; and he resolved in his heart\nto accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if so be the\nremoval of the wool from those venerable countenances depended upon it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nOF THE ARRIVAL OF CLAVILENO AND THE END OF THIS PROTRACTED ADVENTURE\n\n\nAnd now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the\nfamous horse Clavileno, the non-appearance of which was already beginning\nto make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as Malambruno was so\nlong about sending it, either he himself was not the knight for whom the\nadventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not dare to meet him in\nsingle combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men\nall clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse.\nThey placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said,\n\"Let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine.\"\n\nHere Sancho exclaimed, \"I don't mount, for neither have I the heart nor\nam I a knight.\"\n\n\"And let the squire, if he has one,\" continued the wild-man, \"take his\nseat on the croup, and let him trust the valiant Malambruno; for by no\nsword save his, nor by the malice of any other, shall he be assailed. It\nis but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck, and he will bear them\nthrough the air to where Malambruno awaits them; but lest the vast\nelevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must be\ncovered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their having\ncompleted their journey.\"\n\nWith these words, leaving Clavileno behind them, they retired with easy\ndignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse,\nalmost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, \"Valiant knight, the\npromise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our\nbeards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to\nshave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making\na happy beginning with your new journey.\"\n\n\"That I will, Senora Countess Trifaldi,\" said Don Quixote, \"most gladly\nand with right goodwill, without stopping to take a cushion or put on my\nspurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to see you and all these\nduennas shaved clean.\"\n\n\"That I won't,\" said Sancho, \"with good-will or bad-will, or any way at\nall; and if this shaving can't be done without my mounting on the croup,\nmy master had better look out for another squire to go with him, and\nthese ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth; I'm no\nwitch to have a taste for travelling through the air. What would my\nislanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about\non the winds? And another thing, as it is three thousand and odd leagues\nfrom this to Kandy, if the horse tires, or the giant takes huff, we'll be\nhalf a dozen years getting back, and there won't be isle or island in the\nworld that will know me: and so, as it is a common saying 'in delay\nthere's danger,' and 'when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter,'\nthese ladies' beards must excuse me; 'Saint Peter is very well in Rome;'\nI mean I am very well in this house where so much is made of me, and I\nhope for such a good thing from the master as to see myself a governor.\"\n\n\"Friend Sancho,\" said the duke at this, \"the island that I have promised\nyou is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it has roots so\ndeeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easy matter\nto pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as well as I do\nthat there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtained by\na bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that which I look to\nreceive for this government is that you go with your master Don Quixote,\nand bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you\nreturn on Clavileno as quickly as his speed seems to promise, or adverse\nfortune brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to\nhostel and from inn to inn, you will always find your island on your\nreturn where you left it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they\nhave always had to receive you as their governor, and my good-will will\nremain the same; doubt not the truth of this, Senor Sancho, for that\nwould be grievously wronging my disposition to serve you.\"\n\n\"Say no more, senor,\" said Sancho; \"I am a poor squire and not equal to\ncarrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandage my eyes and\ncommit me to God's care, and tell me if I may commend myself to our Lord\nor call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering up there.\"\n\nTo this the Trifaldi made answer, \"Sancho, you may freely commend\nyourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is a\nChristian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection, taking\nvery good care not to fall out with anyone.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"God and the most holy Trinity of Gaeta give me\nhelp!\"\n\n\"Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"I have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were I as\nsuperstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little\ntrepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of these\ngentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;\" and drawing Sancho\naside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands he said,\n\"Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have before us, and God\nknows when we shall return, or what leisure or opportunities this\nbusiness will allow us; I wish thee therefore to retire now to thy\nchamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something required for the\nroad, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five hundred lashes on\naccount of the three thousand three hundred to which thou art bound; it\nwill be all to the good, and to make a beginning with a thing is to have\nit half finished.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said Sancho, \"but your worship must be out of your senses! This\nis like the common saying, 'You see me with child, and you want me a\nvirgin.' Just as I'm about to go sitting on a bare board, your worship\nwould have me score my backside! Indeed, your worship is not reasonable.\nLet us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return I promise on my\nword to make such haste to wipe off all that's due as will satisfy your\nworship; I can't say more.\"\n\n\"Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,\" replied\nDon Quixote, \"and I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeed though stupid\nthou art veracious.\"\n\n\"I'm not voracious,\" said Sancho, \"only peckish; but even if I was a\nlittle, still I'd keep my word.\"\n\nWith this they went back to mount Clavileno, and as they were about to do\nso Don Quixote said, \"Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for one who\nsends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for the\nsake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who trust\nin him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I hope, no malice\nwill be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit.\"\n\n\"Let us be off, senor,\" said Sancho, \"for I have taken the beards and\ntears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan't eat a bit to relish\nit until I have seen them restored to their former smoothness. Mount,\nyour worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup, it\nis plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his\npocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes very carefully;\nbut after having them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying, \"If my\nmemory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the Palladium of\nTroy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddess Pallas, which was\nbig with armed knights, who were afterwards the destruction of Troy; so\nit would be as well to see, first of all, what Clavileno has in his\nstomach.\"\n\n\"There is no occasion,\" said the Distressed One; \"I will be bail for him,\nand I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him;\nyou may mount without any fear, Senor Don Quixote; on my head be it if\nany harm befalls you.\"\n\nDon Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his\nsafety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so,\nwithout more words, he mounted Clavileno, and tried the peg, which turned\neasily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like\nnothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered\non a Flemish tapestry.\n\nMuch against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and,\nafter settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found it rather\nhard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be possible to\noblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off the\ncouch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as the\nhaunches of that horse were more like marble than wood. On this the\nTrifaldi observed that Clavileno would not bear any kind of harness or\ntrappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman,\nas in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.\n\nSancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to be\nbandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking\ntenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in his\npresent strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God might\nprovide some one to say as many for them, whenever they found themselves\nin a similar emergency.\n\nAt this Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Art thou on the gallows, thief, or at thy\nlast moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly, spiritless\ncreature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona occupied, and\nfrom which she descended, not into the grave, but to become Queen of\nFrance; unless the histories lie? And I who am here beside thee, may I\nnot put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres, who pressed this very\nspot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject animal,\nand let not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence.\"\n\n\"Blindfold me,\" said Sancho; \"as you won't let me commend myself or be\ncommended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid there is a region of\ndevils about here that will carry us off to Peralvillo?\"\n\nThey were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled to\nhis satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his fingers\non it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices\nexclaiming, \"God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee, intrepid\nsquire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an arrow! Now\nye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from the earth!\nTake care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mind thou fall not, for\nthy fall will be worse than that rash youth's who tried to steer the\nchariot of his father the Sun!\"\n\nAs Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding\nhis arms round him, he said, \"Senor, how do they make out we are going up\nso high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking quite\nclose to us?\"\n\n\"Don't mind that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for as affairs of this\nsort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, you\ncan see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don't\nsqueeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not what\nthou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I never\nmounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancy\nwe never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeed\neverything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"for such a strong wind comes against me on\nthis side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a thousand\npair of bellows;\" which was the case; they were puffing at him with a\ngreat pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well planned by the\nduke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make\nit perfectly successful.\n\nDon Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, \"Beyond a doubt, Sancho, we\nmust have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail\nand snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderbolts\nare engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at this\nrate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and I know not how\nto regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned.\"\n\nAnd now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that\ncould be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a\ncane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, \"May I die if we are not already\nin that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard has been\nsinged, and I have a mind, senor, to uncover and see whereabouts we are.\"\n\n\"Do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"remember the true story of\nthe licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying through the air\nriding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Rome\nand dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and saw\nthe whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back in\nMadrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen; and\nhe said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devil bade him\nopen his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the body of the\nmoon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of it with his\nhand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he should be\nseized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us to uncover\nourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us; and\nperhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to\ndescend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon does\non the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though it\nseems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we must\nhave travelled a great distance.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that may be,\" said Sancho; \"all I know is that if the\nSenora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she could\nnot have been very tender of flesh.\"\n\nThe duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the\nconversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and\nnow, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and\nwell-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavileno's tail with\nsome tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately\nblew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza\nto the ground half singed. By this time the bearded band of duennas, the\nTrifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained\nlay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got\nup rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at\nfinding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and\nseeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their\nastonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived\na tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of\ngreen silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following\ninscription in large gold letters: \"The illustrious knight Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the\nadventure of the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed\nDuenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the\nduennas are now smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen\nAntonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation\nshall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered\nfrom the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of\nher beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin,\narch-enchanter of enchanters.\"\n\nAs soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he\nperceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and\nreturning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger\nachieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the\ncountenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and\nduchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the\nhand he said, \"Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it's\nnothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as\nthe inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.\"\n\nThe duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness\nafter a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate\nabout the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and\namazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they\npretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The duke\nread the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixote\nwith open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had ever been\nseen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed One, to see\nwhat her face was like without the beard, and if she was as fair as her\nelegant person promised; but they told him that, the instant Clavileno\ndescended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band\nof duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved\nand without a stump left.\n\nThe duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, to which\nSancho replied, \"I felt, senora, that we were flying through the region\nof fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes for a bit;\nbut my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would not let me;\nbut as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a desire to know\nwhat is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without anyone seeing me\nI drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to\nmy nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to\nme that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and\nthat the men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts; so you may\nsee how high we must have got to then.\"\n\nTo this the duchess said, \"Sancho, my friend, mind what you are saying;\nit seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men walking on\nit; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed, and each\nman like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the whole earth.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"but for all that I got a glimpse of a bit\nof one side of it, and saw it all.\"\n\n\"Take care, Sancho,\" said the duchess, \"with a bit of one side one does\nnot see the whole of what one looks at.\"\n\n\"I don't understand that way of looking at things,\" said Sancho; \"I only\nknow that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we were\nflying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth and all the\nmen by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won't believe this,\nno more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to the eyebrows,\nI saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm and a half\nbetween me and it; and by everything that I can swear by, senora, it is\nmighty great! And it so happened we came by where the seven goats are,\nand by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in my own\ncountry, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among them for a\nlittle, and if I had not given way to it I think I'd have burst. So I\ncome and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to anybody, not\neven to my master, softly and quietly I got down from Clavileno and\namused myself with the goats--which are like violets, like flowers--for\nnigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileno never stirred or moved from\none spot.\"\n\n\"And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,\" said the\nduke, \"how did Senor Don Quixote amuse himself?\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"As all these things and such like\noccurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder\nthat Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did\nnot uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or\nsea or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of\nthe air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther\nI cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the\nmoon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that\nheaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned;\nand as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.\"\n\n\"I am neither lying nor dreaming,\" said Sancho; \"only ask me the tokens\nof those same goats, and you'll see by that whether I'm telling the truth\nor not.\"\n\n\"Tell us them then, Sancho,\" said the duchess.\n\n\"Two of them,\" said Sancho, \"are green, two blood-red, two blue, and one\na mixture of all colours.\"\n\n\"An odd sort of goat, that,\" said the duke; \"in this earthly region of\nours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.\"\n\n\"That's very plain,\" said Sancho; \"of course there must be a difference\nbetween the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Sancho,\" said the duke, \"did you see any he-goat among those\ngoats?\"\n\n\"No, senor,\" said Sancho; \"but I have heard say that none ever passed the\nhorns of the moon.\"\n\nThey did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they\nsaw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an\naccount of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred\nfrom the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the\nDistressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not\nonly for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to\ntalk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close\nto his ear, said to him, \"Sancho, as you would have us believe what you\nsaw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave\nof Montesinos; I say no more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nOF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT TO\nGOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS\n\n\nThe duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll\nresult of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to\ncarry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for\nmaking it all pass for reality. So having laid their plans and given\ninstructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his\ngovernment of the promised island, the next day, that following\nClavileno's flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go\nand be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as\nfor the showers of May.\n\nSancho made him an obeisance, and said, \"Ever since I came down from\nheaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it\nis, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me;\nfor what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or\nwhat dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as\nhazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole\nearth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a\nbit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I'd rather have it\nthan the best island in the world.\"\n\n\"Recollect, Sancho,\" said the duke, \"I cannot give a bit of heaven, no\nnot so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours of\nthat sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you, and\nthat is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and\nuncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your\nopportunities, you may, with the help of the world's riches, gain those\nof heaven.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"let the island come; and I'll try and be such\na governor, that in spite of scoundrels I'll go to heaven; and it's not\nfrom any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself, but\nfrom the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a governor.\"\n\n\"If you once make trial of it, Sancho,\" said the duke, \"you'll eat your\nfingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and\nbe obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor (as he\nwill beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it will be\nno easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore and\nsorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"it is my belief it's a good thing to be in\ncommand, if it's only over a drove of cattle.\"\n\n\"May I be buried with you, Sancho,\" said the duke, \"but you know\neverything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity\npromises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow is\nthe day you must set out for the government of the island, and this\nevening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear, and\nall things requisite for your departure.\"\n\n\"Let them dress me as they like,\" said Sancho; \"however I'm dressed I'll\nbe Sancho Panza.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said the duke; \"but one's dress must be suited to the\noffice or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress like\na soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You, Sancho, shall go partly as a\nlawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am giving you, arms are\nneeded as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.\"\n\n\"Of letters I know but little,\" said Sancho, \"for I don't even know the A\nB C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to be a\ngood governor. As for arms, I'll handle those they give me till I drop,\nand then, God be my help!\"\n\n\"With so good a memory,\" said the duke, \"Sancho cannot go wrong in\nanything.\"\n\nHere Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon\nSancho was to go to his government, he with the duke's permission took\nhim by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of\ngiving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. As\nsoon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, and\nalmost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone thus\naddressed him: \"I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho, that,\nbefore I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward to meet\nthee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense of\nthy services, find myself still waiting for advancement, while thou,\nbefore the time, and contrary to all reasonable expectation, seest\nthyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires. Some will bribe, beg,\nsolicit, rise early, entreat, persist, without attaining the object of\ntheir suit; while another comes, and without knowing why or wherefore,\nfinds himself invested with the place or office so many have sued for;\nand here it is that the common saying, 'There is good luck as well as bad\nluck in suits,' applies. Thou, who, to my thinking, art beyond all doubt\na dullard, without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble,\nwith the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee,\nseest thyself without more ado governor of an island, as though it were a\nmere matter of course. This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the\nfavour thou hast received to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven\nthat disposes matters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great\npower the profession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart,\nthen, inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to\nthy Cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to\ndirect and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou\nart about to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are nothing\nelse but a mighty gulf of troubles.\n\n\"First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him is\nwisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.\n\n\"Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to know\nthyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. If\nthou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like\nthe frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost,\nthe recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as\nthe ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.\"\n\n\"That's the truth,\" said Sancho; \"but that was when I was a boy;\nafterwards when I was something more of a man it was geese I kept, not\npigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all who are\ngovernors don't come of a kingly stock.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Don Quixote, \"and for that reason those who are not of noble\norigin should take care that the dignity of the office they hold be\naccompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will save them from\nthe sneers of malice that no station escapes.\n\n\"Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of saying thou art\npeasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one will set\nhimself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather upon being one\nof lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who, born of mean\nparentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontifical and imperial,\nand of the truth of this I could give thee instances enough to weary\nthee.\n\n\"Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride in doing\nvirtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have princely\nand lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue an acquisition,\nand virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not possess.\n\n\"This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to see\nthee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slight him,\nbut on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make much of him;\nfor in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is not pleased\nthat any should despise what it hath made), and wilt comply with the laws\nof well-ordered nature.\n\n\"If thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for those that\nadminister governments to be long without their wives), teach and\ninstruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for all\nthat may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorish\nstupid wife.\n\n\"If perchance thou art left a widower--a thing which may happen--and in\nvirtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not one\nto serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy\n'won't have it;' for verily, I tell thee, for all the judge's wife\nreceives, the husband will be held accountable at the general calling to\naccount; where he will have repay in death fourfold, items that in life\nhe regarded as naught.\n\n\"Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant men who\nplume themselves on cleverness.\n\n\"Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but not\nmore justice, than the pleadings of the rich.\n\n\"Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presents of\nthe rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.\n\n\"When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmost\nrigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the stern\njudge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.\n\n\"If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it be\nnot by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.\n\n\"If it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of one who is\nthine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on the\njustice of the case.\n\n\"Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man's cause; for the\nerrors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable; or if\nnot, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of thy\nfortune.\n\n\"If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thine eyes\nfrom her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and consider\ndeliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thy\nreason swept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.\n\n\"Abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the pain of\npunishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of thine\nobjurgations.\n\n\"Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is but a\nmiserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature, and\nso far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing; for\nthough the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes that of mercy is\nbrighter and loftier than that of justice.\n\n\"If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will be\nlong, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable;\nthou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy grandchildren\nwill bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men; and,\nwhen life draws to a close, death will come to thee in calm and ripe old\nage, and the light and loving hands of thy great-grandchildren will close\nthine eyes.\n\n\"What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the\nadornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the\nbody.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nOF THE SECOND SET OF COUNSELS DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA\n\n\nWho, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have set\nhim down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude of\npurpose? But, as has been frequently observed in the course of this great\nhistory, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and in\ndiscussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassed\nunderstanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to his\nintellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of these second\ncounsels that he gave Sancho, he showed himself to have a lively turn of\nhumour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also his folly.\n\nSancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to fix\nhis counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them and by\ntheir means bring the full promise of his government to a happy issue.\nDon Quixote, then, went on to say:\n\n\"With regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy person and thy\nhouse, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to be clean, and\nto cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whose ignorance makes\nthem fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands, as if those\nexcrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not the talons of a\nlizard-catching kestrel--a filthy and unnatural abuse.\n\n\"Go not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign of an\nunstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to be set\ndown to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of Julius Caesar.\n\n\"Ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it will allow\nthee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable and\nserviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between thy\nservants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six pages,\nclothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages for heaven\nand pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this new mode of\ngiving liveries.\n\n\"Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin by the\nsmell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as to\nmake it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is bad.\n\n\"Dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of the whole\nbody is forged in the workshop of the stomach.\n\n\"Be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keeps\nneither secrets nor promises.\n\n\"Take care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct in\nanybody's presence.\"\n\n\"Eruct!\" said Sancho; \"I don't know what that means.\"\n\n\"To eruct, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"means to belch, and that is one of\nthe filthiest words in the Spanish language, though a very expressive\none; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to the Latin, and instead\nof belch say eruct, and instead of belches say eructations; and if some\ndo not understand these terms it matters little, for custom will bring\nthem into use in the course of time, so that they will be readily\nunderstood; this is the way a language is enriched; custom and the public\nare all-powerful there.\"\n\n\"In truth, senor,\" said Sancho, \"one of the counsels and cautions I mean\nto bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I'm constantly doing\nit.\"\n\n\"Eruct, Sancho, not belch,\" said Don Quixote.\n\n\"Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,\" said\nSancho.\n\n\"Likewise, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou must not mingle such a\nquantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; for though proverbs\nare short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by the head and\nshoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.\"\n\n\"God alone can cure that,\" said Sancho; \"for I have more proverbs in me\nthan a book, and when I speak they come so thick together into my mouth\nthat they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that's why my\ntongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat to the\npurpose. But I'll take care henceforward to use such as befit the dignity\nof my office; for 'in a house where there's plenty, supper is soon\ncooked,' and 'he who binds does not wrangle,' and 'the bell-ringer's in a\nsafe berth,' and 'giving and keeping require brains.'\"\n\n\"That's it, Sancho!\" said Don Quixote; \"pack, tack, string proverbs\ntogether; nobody is hindering thee! 'My mother beats me, and I go on with\nmy tricks.' I am bidding thee avoid proverbs, and here in a second thou\nhast shot out a whole litany of them, which have as much to do with what\nwe are talking about as 'over the hills of Ubeda.' Mind, Sancho, I do not\nsay that a proverb aptly brought in is objectionable; but to pile up and\nstring together proverbs at random makes conversation dull and vulgar.\n\n\"When thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body on the\nback of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from the\nhorse's belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thou wert on\nDapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and grooms of\nothers.\n\n\"Be moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does not get\nthe benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the mother of\ngood fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained the object\nof an honest ambition.\n\n\"The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend to bodily\nimprovement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory, for I\nbelieve it will be no less useful to thee than those I have given thee\nalready, and it is this--never engage in a dispute about families, at\nleast in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily one\nof those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be hated\nby the one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shape from the\none thou hast exalted.\n\n\"Thy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloak a\ntrifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becoming neither\nfor gentlemen nor for governors.\n\n\"For the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me to advise\nthee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shall follow,\nif thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"I see well enough that all these things your\nworship has said to me are good, holy, and profitable; but what use will\nthey be to me if I don't remember one of them? To be sure that about not\nletting my nails grow, and marrying again if I have the chance, will not\nslip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle, and jumble--I don't\nand can't recollect any more of it than of last year's clouds; so it must\nbe given me in writing; for though I can't either read or write, I'll\ngive it to my confessor, to drive it into me and remind me of it whenever\nit is necessary.\"\n\n\"Ah, sinner that I am!\" said Don Quixote, \"how bad it looks in governors\nnot to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee, Sancho, when a\nman knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues one of two\nthings; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowly parents,\nor that he himself was so incorrigible and ill-conditioned that neither\ngood company nor good teaching could make any impression on him. It is a\ngreat defect that thou labourest under, and therefore I would have thee\nlearn at any rate to sign thy name.\" \"I can sign my name well enough,\"\nsaid Sancho, \"for when I was steward of the brotherhood in my village I\nlearned to make certain letters, like the marks on bales of goods, which\nthey told me made out my name. Besides I can pretend my right hand is\ndisabled and make some one else sign for me, for 'there's a remedy for\neverything except death;' and as I shall be in command and hold the\nstaff, I can do as I like; moreover, 'he who has the alcalde for his\nfather-,' and I'll be governor, and that's higher than alcalde. Only come\nand see! Let them make light of me and abuse me; 'they'll come for wool\nand go back shorn;' 'whom God loves, his house is known to Him;' 'the\nsilly sayings of the rich pass for saws in the world;' and as I'll be\nrich, being a governor, and at the same time generous, as I mean to be,\nno fault will be seen in me. 'Only make yourself honey and the flies will\nsuck you;' 'as much as thou hast so much art thou worth,' as my\ngrandmother used to say; and 'thou canst have no revenge of a man of\nsubstance.'\"\n\n\"Oh, God's curse upon thee, Sancho!\" here exclaimed Don Quixote; \"sixty\nthousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs! For the last hour\nthou hast been stringing them together and inflicting the pangs of\ntorture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs will bring thee to\nthe gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will take the\ngovernment from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me, where\ndost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them, thou\nblockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, I have\nto sweat and labour as if I were digging.\"\n\n\"By God, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"your worship is making a fuss about\nvery little. Why the devil should you be vexed if I make use of what is\nmy own? And I have got nothing else, nor any other stock in trade except\nproverbs and more proverbs; and here are three just this instant come\ninto my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in a basket; but I won't\nrepeat them, for 'sage silence is called Sancho.'\"\n\n\"That, Sancho, thou art not,\" said Don Quixote; \"for not only art thou\nnot sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate and perversity; still I\nwould like to know what three proverbs have just now come into thy\nmemory, for I have been turning over mine own--and it is a good one--and\nnone occurs to me.\"\n\n\"What can be better,\" said Sancho, \"than 'never put thy thumbs between\ntwo back teeth;' and 'to \"get out of my house\" and \"what do you want with\nmy wife?\" there is no answer;' and 'whether the pitcher hits the stove,\nor the stove the pitcher, it's a bad business for the pitcher;' all which\nfit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor, or him in\nauthority over him, because he will come off the worst, as he does who\nputs his finger between two back and if they are not back teeth it makes\nno difference, so long as they are teeth; and to whatever the governor\nmay say there's no answer, any more than to 'get out of my house' and\n'what do you want with my wife?' and then, as for that about the stone\nand the pitcher, a blind man could see that. So that he 'who sees the\nmote in another's eye had need to see the beam in his own,' that it be\nnot said of himself, 'the dead woman was frightened at the one with her\nthroat cut;' and your worship knows well that 'the fool knows more in his\nown house than the wise man in another's.'\"\n\n\"Nay, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"the fool knows nothing, either in his\nown house or in anybody else's, for no wise structure of any sort can\nstand on a foundation of folly; but let us say no more about it, Sancho,\nfor if thou governest badly, thine will be the fault and mine the shame;\nbut I comfort myself with having done my duty in advising thee as\nearnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I am released from my\nobligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, and govern thee in\nthy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thou wilt\nturn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily prevent by\nexplaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that fat\nlittle person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs and\nsauciness.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho, \"if your worship thinks I'm not fit for this\ngovernment, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail of\nmy soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just as well,\nsimple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridges and\ncapons; and what's more, while we're asleep we're all equal, great and\nsmall, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into it, you will see it\nwas your worship alone that put me on to this business of governing; for\nI know no more about the government of islands than a buzzard; and if\nthere's any reason to think that because of my being a governor the devil\nwill get hold of me, I'd rather go Sancho to heaven than governor to\nhell.\"\n\n\"By God, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for those last words thou hast\nuttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand\nislands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which no knowledge is\nworth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swerve in the\npursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim and fixed\npurpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heaven\nalways helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for I think my\nlord and lady are waiting for us.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nHOW SANCHO PANZA WAS CONDUCTED TO HIS GOVERNMENT, AND OF THE STRANGE\nADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE\n\n\nIt is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that when\nCide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translate\nit as he wrote it--that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor made against\nhimself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so little variety\nas this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to speak perpetually\nof him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressions and\nepisodes more serious and more interesting. He said, too, that to go on,\nmind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject, and\nspeaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerable\ndrudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author's labour, and\nthat to avoid this he had in the First Part availed himself of the device\nof novels, like \"The Ill-advised Curiosity,\" and \"The Captive Captain,\"\nwhich stand, as it were, apart from the story; the others are given there\nbeing incidents which occurred to Don Quixote himself and could not be\nomitted. He also thought, he says, that many, engrossed by the interest\nattaching to the exploits of Don Quixote, would take none in the novels,\nand pass them over hastily or impatiently without noticing the elegance\nand art of their composition, which would be very manifest were they\npublished by themselves and not as mere adjuncts to the crazes of Don\nQuixote or the simplicities of Sancho. Therefore in this Second Part he\nthought it best not to insert novels, either separate or interwoven, but\nonly episodes, something like them, arising out of the circumstances the\nfacts present; and even these sparingly, and with no more words than\nsuffice to make them plain; and as he confines and restricts himself to\nthe narrow limits of the narrative, though he has ability; capacity, and\nbrains enough to deal with the whole universe, he requests that his\nlabours may not be despised, and that credit be given him, not alone for\nwhat he writes, but for what he has refrained from writing.\n\nAnd so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave\nthe counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to\nhim in writing so that he might get some one to read them to him. They\nhad scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they\nfell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they\nwere both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote. To carry\non the joke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large\nfollowing to the village that was to serve him for an island. It happened\nthat the person who had him in charge was a majordomo of the duke's, a\nman of great discretion and humour--and there can be no humour without\ndiscretion--and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldi in\nthe comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified, and\ninstructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he\ncarried out their scheme admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as\nSancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of\nthe Trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, \"Senor, either\nthe devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing,\nor your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the\nduke's here is the very face of the Distressed One.\"\n\nDon Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said\nto Sancho, \"There is no reason why the devil should carry thee off,\nSancho, either righteous or believing--and what thou meanest by that I\nknow not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, but\nfor all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his being so\nwould involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going\ninto questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an\ninextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly to\nour Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters.\"\n\n\"It is no joke, senor,\" said Sancho, \"for before this I heard him speak,\nand it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi was sounding in my\nears. Well, I'll hold my peace; but I'll take care to be on the look-out\nhenceforth for any sign that may be seen to confirm or do away with this\nsuspicion.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt do well, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and thou wilt let me know\nall thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thy government.\"\n\nSancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He was\ndressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet\nover all and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta\nupon a mule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke's orders, followed\nDapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from time\nto time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well pleased to have\nhim with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor of\nGermany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess and\ngot his master's blessing, which Don Quixote gave him with tears, and he\nreceived blubbering.\n\nLet worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; and\nlook out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he behaved\nhimself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thy attention to\nwhat happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh\nthereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for Don\nQuixote's adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with\nlaughter.\n\nIt is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt\nhis loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate\nand take away the government from him he would have done so. The duchess\nobserved his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, she\nsaid, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, and\ndamsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction.\n\n\"The truth is, senora,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that I do feel the loss of\nSancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the\noffers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with which\nthey are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your excellence to\npermit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the duchess, \"that must not be; four of\nmy damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.\"\n\n\"To me,\" said Don Quixote, \"they will not be flowers, but thorns to\npierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my\nchamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further,\nthough I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself\nin my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my\nvirtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your\nhighness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will sleep\nin my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.\"\n\n\"Say no more, Senor Don Quixote, say no more,\" said the duchess; \"I\nassure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel,\nshall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine the propriety of\nSenor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the one\nthat is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship may undress and\ndress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you please,\nfor there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you will find\nall the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who sleeps with his\ndoor locked, to the end that no natural needs compel you to open it. May\nthe great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand years, and may her fame\nextend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to be loved by\na knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into\nthe heart of our governor Sancho Panza to finish off his discipline\nspeedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a\nlady.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Your highness has spoken like what you\nare; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcinea\nwill be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise of\nyour highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth\ncould bestow upon her.\"\n\n\"Well, well, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the duchess, it is nearly supper-time,\nand the duke is probably waiting; come let us go to supper, and retire\nto rest early, for the journey you made yesterday from Kandy was not such\na short one but that it must have caused you some fatigue.\"\n\n\"I feel none, senora,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I would go so far as to\nswear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounted a quieter\nbeast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileno; and I don't know what\ncould have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and so gentle,\nand burn it so recklessly as he did.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said the duchess, \"repenting of the evil he had done to the\nTrifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he must have committed\nas a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away with all the\ninstruments of his craft; and so burned Clavileno as the chief one, and\nthat which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land; and by\nits ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great Don\nQuixote of La Mancha is established for ever.\"\n\nDon Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retired\nto his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to wait\non him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead or\ndrive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady Dulcinea; for he had\nalways present to his mind the virtue of Amadis, that flower and mirror\nof knights-errant. He locked the door behind him, and by the light of two\nwax candles undressed himself, but as he was taking off his stockings--O\ndisaster unworthy of such a personage!--there came a burst, not of sighs,\nor anything belying his delicacy or good breeding, but of some two dozen\nstitches in one of his stockings, that made it look like a\nwindow-lattice. The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and\nat that moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a\ndrachm of green silk there; I say green silk, because the stockings were\ngreen.\n\nHere Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, \"O poverty, poverty! I know\nnot what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee 'holy\ngift ungratefully received.' Although a Moor, I know well enough from the\nintercourse I have had with Christians that holiness consists in charity,\nhumility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for all that, I say he must\nhave a great deal of godliness who can find any satisfaction in being\npoor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty one of their greatest\nsaints refers to, saying, 'possess all things as though ye possessed them\nnot;' which is what they call poverty in spirit. But thou, that other\npoverty--for it is of thee I am speaking now--why dost thou love to fall\nout with gentlemen and men of good birth more than with other people? Why\ndost thou compel them to smear the cracks in their shoes, and to have the\nbuttons of their coats, one silk, another hair, and another glass? Why\nmust their ruffs be always crinkled like endive leaves, and not crimped\nwith a crimping iron?\" (From this we may perceive the antiquity of starch\nand crimped ruffs.) Then he goes on: \"Poor gentleman of good family!\nalways cockering up his honour, dining miserably and in secret, and\nmaking a hypocrite of the toothpick with which he sallies out into the\nstreet after eating nothing to oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say,\nwith his nervous honour, fancying they perceive a league off the patch on\nhis shoe, the sweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and\nthe hunger of his stomach!\"\n\nAll this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his stitches;\nhowever, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had left behind a\npair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the next day. At last\nhe went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he\nmissed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings,\nthe stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another\ncolour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can\nshow in the course of his never-failing embarrassments. He put out the\ncandles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep; he rose from his\nbed and opened slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful\ngarden, and as he did so he perceived and heard people walking and\ntalking in the garden. He set himself to listen attentively, and those\nbelow raised their voices so that he could hear these words:\n\n\"Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this\nstranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but\nonly weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I\nwould not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and\neven if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain,\nif this strange AEneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me,\nsleeps on and wakens not to hear it.\"\n\n\"Heed not that, dear Altisidora,\" replied a voice; \"the duchess is no\ndoubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and\ndisturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated\nwindow of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a\nlow sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the duchess\nhears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.\"\n\n\"That is not the point, Emerencia,\" replied Altisidora, \"it is that I\nwould not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should be\nthought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power\nof love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in\nthe heart;\" and here a harp softly touched made itself heard. As he\nlistened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless amazement,\nfor immediately the countless adventures like this, with windows,\ngratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings, that he had\nread of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind. He at once\nconcluded that some damsel of the duchess's was in love with him, and\nthat her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. He trembled lest\nhe should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and\ncommending himself with all his might and soul to his lady Dulcinea he\nmade up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he was\nthere he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little\ndelighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hear them. So\nhaving tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand across the strings,\nbegan this ballad:\n\nO thou that art above in bed,\n  Between the holland sheets,\nA-lying there from night till morn,\n  With outstretched legs asleep;\n\nO thou, most valiant knight of all\n  The famed Manchegan breed,\nOf purity and virtue more\n  Than gold of Araby;\n\nGive ear unto a suffering maid,\n  Well-grown but evil-starr'd,\nFor those two suns of thine have lit\n  A fire within her heart.\n\nAdventures seeking thou dost rove,\n  To others bringing woe;\nThou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm\n  To heal them dost withhold!\n\nSay, valiant youth, and so may God\n  Thy enterprises speed,\nDidst thou the light mid Libya's sands\n  Or Jaca's rocks first see?\n\nDid scaly serpents give thee suck?\n  Who nursed thee when a babe?\nWert cradled in the forest rude,\n  Or gloomy mountain cave?\n\nO Dulcinea may be proud,\n  That plump and lusty maid;\nFor she alone hath had the power\n  A tiger fierce to tame.\n\nAnd she for this shall famous be\n  From Tagus to Jarama,\nFrom Manzanares to Genil,\n  From Duero to Arlanza.\n\nFain would I change with her, and give\n  A petticoat to boot,\nThe best and bravest that I have,\n  All trimmed with gold galloon.\n\nO for to be the happy fair\n  Thy mighty arms enfold,\nOr even sit beside thy bed\n  And scratch thy dusty poll!\n\nI rave,--to favours such as these\n  Unworthy to aspire;\nThy feet to tickle were enough\n  For one so mean as I.\n\nWhat caps, what slippers silver-laced,\n  Would I on thee bestow!\nWhat damask breeches make for thee;\n  What fine long holland cloaks!\n\nAnd I would give thee pearls that should\n  As big as oak-galls show;\nSo matchless big that each might well\n  Be called the great \"Alone.\"\n\nManchegan Nero, look not down\n  From thy Tarpeian Rock\nUpon this burning heart, nor add\n  The fuel of thy wrath.\n\nA virgin soft and young am I,\n  Not yet fifteen years old;\n(I'm only three months past fourteen,\n  I swear upon my soul).\n\nI hobble not nor do I limp,\n  All blemish I'm without,\nAnd as I walk my lily locks\n  Are trailing on the ground.\n\nAnd though my nose be rather flat,\n  And though my mouth be wide,\nMy teeth like topazes exalt\n  My beauty to the sky.\n\nThou knowest that my voice is sweet,\n  That is if thou dost hear;\nAnd I am moulded in a form\n  Somewhat below the mean.\n\nThese charms, and many more, are thine,\n  Spoils to thy spear and bow all;\nA damsel of this house am I,\n  By name Altisidora.\n\nHere the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while the\nwarmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he\nsaid to himself, \"O that I should be such an unlucky knight that no\ndamsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that the peerless\nDulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my\nincomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, ye queens? Why\ndo ye persecute her, ye empresses? Why ye pursue her, ye virgins of from\nfourteen to fifteen? Leave the unhappy being to triumph, rejoice and\nglory in the lot love has been pleased to bestow upon her in surrendering\nmy heart and yielding up my soul to her. Ye love-smitten host, know that\nto Dulcinea only I am dough and sugar-paste, flint to all others; for her\nI am honey, for you aloes. For me Dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise,\nvirtuous, graceful, and high-bred, and all others are ill-favoured,\nfoolish, light, and low-born. Nature sent me into the world to be hers\nand no other's; Altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they\nbelaboured me in the castle of the enchanted Moor may give way to\ndespair, but I must be Dulcinea's, boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and\nchaste, in spite of all the magic-working powers on earth.\" And with that\nhe shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of\nsorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on\nhis bed, where we will leave him for the present, as the great Sancho\nPanza, who is about to set up his famous government, now demands our\nattention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nOF HOW THE GREAT SANCHO PANZA TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ISLAND, AND OF HOW\nHE MADE A BEGINNING IN GOVERNING\n\n\nO perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye of\nheaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers! Thimbraeus here, Phoebus\nthere, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music;\nthou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never settest!\nTo thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I appeal to help\nme and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able to proceed with\nscrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great Sancho Panza's\ngovernment; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble, and uncertain.\n\nTo come to the point, then--Sancho with all his attendants arrived at a\nvillage of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke\npossessed. They informed him that it was called the island of Barataria,\neither because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of the\njoke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. On\nreaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipality\ncame forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitants\nshowed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp they\nconducted him to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then\nwith burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town,\nand acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria.\nThe costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor\nastonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were,\nand they were not a few. Finally, leading him out of the church they\ncarried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke's\nmajordomo said to him, \"It is an ancient custom in this island, senor\ngovernor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is\nbound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must be a\nsomewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the\nmeasure of their new governor's wit, and hail with joy or deplore his\narrival accordingly.\"\n\nWhile the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several\nlarge letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could\nnot read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer\nwas, \"Senor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship\ntook possession of this island, and the inscription says, 'This day, the\nso-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Senor Don Sancho Panza took\npossession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.'\"\n\n\"And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?\" asked Sancho.\n\n\"Your lordship,\" replied the majordomo; \"for no other Panza but the one\nwho is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.\"\n\n\"Well then, let me tell you, brother,\" said Sancho, \"I haven't got the\n'Don,' nor has any one of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho\nPanza, and Sancho was my father's name, and Sancho was my grandfather's\nand they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Donas tacked on; I suspect\nthat in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God\nknows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days I'll weed\nout these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges,\nthey're so plenty. Let the majordomo go on with his question, and I'll\ngive the best answer I can, whether the people deplore or not.\"\n\nAt this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane by\nway of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, \"Senor, some\ntime ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify him and\ndo him a service, on the condition that he was to return them to me\nwhenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked for\nthem, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them than\nhe was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing careless\nabout payment I asked for them once and several times; and not only will\nhe not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and says I never\nlent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid them; and I have no\nwitnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for he never paid me; I\nwant your worship to put him to his oath, and if he swears he returned\nthem to me I forgive him the debt here and before God.\"\n\n\"What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?\" said Sancho.\n\nTo which the old man replied, \"I admit, senor, that he lent them to me;\nbut let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,\nI'll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.\"\n\nThe governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had the\nstick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he swore, as\nif he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the cross of the\nstaff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him\nhad been lent him; but that he had with his own hand given them back into\nthe hand of the other, and that he, not recollecting it, was always\nasking for them.\n\nSeeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to\nmake to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had told\nthe truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good Christian,\nand he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back the\ncrowns; and that from that time forth he would make no further demand\nupon him.\n\nThe debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.\nObserving this, and how, without another word, he made off, and observing\ntoo the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head in his bosom\nand remained for a short space in deep thought, with the forefinger of\nhis right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his head and bade\nthem call back the old man with the stick, for he had already taken his\ndeparture. They brought him back, and as soon as Sancho saw him he said,\n\"Honest man, give me that stick, for I want it.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said the old man; \"here it is senor,\" and he put it into his\nhand.\n\nSancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, \"Go,\nand God be with you; for now you are paid.\"\n\n\"I, senor!\" returned the old man; \"why, is this cane worth ten\ngold-crowns?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the governor, \"or if not I am the greatest dolt in the world;\nnow you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a whole\nkingdom;\" and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in the\npresence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they found ten\ngold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their\ngovernor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the\nconclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that\nobserving how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while\nhe was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given him\nthe crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the\nstick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside\nit; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides\nthose who govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools;\nbesides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention just such\nanother case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he\nforgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be such a memory\nin all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen,\nand the other in high contentment, all who were present were astonished,\nand he who was recording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could\nnot make up his mind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as\na fool or as a man of sense.\n\nAs soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman\nholding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle\ndealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming,\n\"Justice, senor governor, justice! and if I don't get it on earth I'll go\nlook for it in heaven. Senor governor of my soul, this wicked man caught\nme in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it was an\nill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept these\nthree-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and\nChristians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and\nkeeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the\nbrambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle\nme!\"\n\n\"It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,\"\nsaid Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he had to say in\nanswer to the woman's charge.\n\nHe all in confusion made answer, \"Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and this\nmorning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) four pigs, and\nbetween dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than the worth\nof them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on the road with this\ngood dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out of everything,\nyoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she not contented laid hold of\nme and never let go until she brought me here; she says I forced her, but\nshe lies by the oath I swear or am ready to swear; and this is the whole\ntruth and every particle of it.\"\n\nThe governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him;\nhe said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. The\ngovernor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyed\ntrembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and\npraying to God for the long life and health of the senor governor who had\nsuch regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of court\nwith the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however, to see\nif the money it contained was silver.\n\nAs soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears\nwere already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse,\n\"Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her, by force\neven, and come back with it here;\" and he did not say it to one who was a\nfool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning, and ran to\ndo as he was bid.\n\nAll the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and\npresently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before,\nshe with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and he\nstruggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout was\nthe woman's defence, she all the while crying out, \"Justice from God and\nthe world! see here, senor governor, the shamelessness and boldness of\nthis villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle of the street,\nwanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him give me.\"\n\n\"And did he take it?\" asked the governor.\n\n\"Take it!\" said the woman; \"I'd let my life be taken from me sooner than\nthe purse. A pretty child I'd be! It's another sort of cat they must\nthrow in my face, and not that poor scurvy knave. Pincers and hammers,\nmallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, nor lions'\nclaws; the soul from out of my body first!\"\n\n\"She is right,\" said the man; \"I own myself beaten and powerless; I\nconfess I haven't the strength to take it from her;\" and he let go his\nhold of her.\n\nUpon this the governor said to the woman, \"Let me see that purse, my\nworthy and sturdy friend.\" She handed it to him at once, and the governor\nreturned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress of force,\n\"Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spirit and\nvigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that purse,\nthe strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off, and God speed\nyou, and bad luck to you, and don't show your face in all this island, or\nwithin six leagues of it on any side, under pain of two hundred lashes;\nbe off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.\"\n\nThe woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; and\nthe governor said to the man, \"Honest man, go home with your money, and\nGod speed you; and for the future, if you don't want to lose it, see that\nyou don't take it into your head to yoke with anybody.\" The man thanked\nhim as clumsily as he could and went his way, and the bystanders were\nagain filled with admiration at their new governor's judgments and\nsentences.\n\nNext, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor,\nfor he had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves before him,\nand the tailor said, \"Senor governor, this labourer and I come before\nyour worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday\n(for saving everybody's presence I'm a passed tailor, God be thanked),\nand putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me, 'Senor, will\nthere be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?' Measuring the cloth I\nsaid there would. He probably suspected--as I supposed, and I supposed\nright--that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think so by his\nown roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors; and he told me to\nsee if there would be enough for two. I guessed what he would be at, and\nI said 'yes.' He, still following up his original unworthy notion, went\non adding cap after cap, and I 'yes' after 'yes,' until we got as far as\nfive. He has just this moment come for them; I gave them to him, but he\nwon't pay me for the making; on the contrary, he calls upon me to pay\nhim, or else return his cloth.\"\n\n\"Is all this true, brother?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man; \"but will your worship make him show the five\ncaps he has made me?\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the tailor; and drawing his hand from under his\ncloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it, and said,\n\"there are the caps this good man asks for; and by God and upon my\nconscience I haven't a scrap of cloth left, and I'll let the work be\nexamined by the inspectors of the trade.\"\n\nAll present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit;\nSancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, \"It seems to me\nthat in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-winded arguments,\nbut only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and so my\ndecision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth,\nand that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there be no\nmore about it.\"\n\nIf the previous decision about the cattle dealer's purse excited the\nadmiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, the\ngovernor's orders were after all executed. All this, having been taken\ndown by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was\nlooking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good\nSancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora's music,\nhas pressing claims upon us now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nOF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE OF\nTHE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA'S WOOING\n\n\nWe left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the\nenamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them,\nand just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment's rest,\nand the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time is\nfleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours,\nand morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft\ndown, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put\non his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw\nover him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet\ntrimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with\nhis good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried\nwith him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the\nantechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting\nfor him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other\ndamsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant\nAltisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in\nher lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.\n\nDon Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, \"I know very well\nwhat this seizure arises from.\"\n\n\"I know not from what,\" replied the friend, \"for Altisidora is the\nhealthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard her complain\nall the time I have known her. A plague on all the knights-errant in the\nworld, if they be all ungrateful! Go away, Senor Don Quixote; for this\npoor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here.\"\n\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \"Do me the favour, senora, to let a lute\nbe placed in my chamber to-night; and I will comfort this poor maiden to\nthe best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt\ndisillusion is an approved remedy;\" and with this he retired, so as not\nto be remarked by any who might see him there.\n\nHe had scarcely withdrawn when Altisidora, recovering from her swoon,\nsaid to her companion, \"The lute must be left, for no doubt Don Quixote\nintends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad.\"\n\nThey went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the\nlute Don Quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted\nwith the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be\namusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came\nquickly as the day had come; and as for the day, the duke and duchess\nspent it in charming conversation with Don Quixote.\n\nWhen eleven o'clock came, Don Quixote found a guitar in his chamber; he\ntried it, opened the window, and perceived that some persons were walking\nin the garden; and having passed his fingers over the frets of the guitar\nand tuned it as well as he could, he spat and cleared his chest, and then\nwith a voice a little hoarse but full-toned, he sang the following\nballad, which he had himself that day composed:\n\nMighty Love the hearts of maidens\n  Doth unsettle and perplex,\nAnd the instrument he uses\n  Most of all is idleness.\n\nSewing, stitching, any labour,\n  Having always work to do,\nTo the poison Love instilleth\n  Is the antidote most sure.\n\nAnd to proper-minded maidens\n  Who desire the matron's name\nModesty's a marriage portion,\n  Modesty their highest praise.\n\nMen of prudence and discretion,\n  Courtiers gay and gallant knights,\nWith the wanton damsels dally,\n  But the modest take to wife.\n\nThere are passions, transient, fleeting,\n  Loves in hostelries declar'd,\nSunrise loves, with sunset ended,\n  When the guest hath gone his way.\n\nLove that springs up swift and sudden,\n  Here to-day, to-morrow flown,\nPasses, leaves no trace behind it,\n  Leaves no image on the soul.\n\nPainting that is laid on painting\n  Maketh no display or show;\nWhere one beauty's in possession\n  There no other can take hold.\n\nDulcinea del Toboso\n  Painted on my heart I wear;\nNever from its tablets, never,\n  Can her image be eras'd.\n\nThe quality of all in lovers\n  Most esteemed is constancy;\n'T is by this that love works wonders,\n  This exalts them to the skies.\n\nDon Quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,\nAltisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,\nwhen all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his\nwindow they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to\nit, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats,\nwhich also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. Such was the\ndin of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and\nduchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while\nDon Quixote stood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or\nthree of the cats made their way in through the grating of his chamber,\nand flying from one side to the other, made it seem as if there was a\nlegion of devils at large in it. They extinguished the candles that were\nburning in the room, and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the\ncord with the large bells never ceased rising and falling; and most of\nthe people of the castle, not knowing what was really the matter, were at\ntheir wits' end with astonishment. Don Quixote sprang to his feet, and\ndrawing his sword, began making passes at the grating, shouting out,\n\"Avaunt, malignant enchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not\nnor have any power.\" And turning upon the cats that were running about\nthe room, he made several cuts at them. They dashed at the grating and\nescaped by it, save one that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes\nof Don Quixote's sword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth\nand nail, with the pain of which he began to shout his loudest. The duke\nand duchess hearing this, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to\nhis room, and as the poor gentleman was striving with all his might to\ndetach the cat from his face, they opened the door with a master-key and\nwent in with lights and witnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran\nforward to part the combatants, but Don Quixote cried out aloud, \"Let no\none take him from me; leave me hand to hand with this demon, this wizard,\nthis enchanter; I will teach him, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha\nis.\" The cat, however, never minding these threats, snarled and held on;\nbut at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window. Don\nQuixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not\nin very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him\nfinish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an\nenchanter. They sent for some oil of John's wort, and Altisidora herself\nwith her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so\nshe said to him in a low voice. \"All these mishaps have befallen thee,\nhardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and\nGod grant thy squire Sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that\ndearly beloved Dulcinea of thine may never be released from her\nenchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while I who\nadore thee am alive.\"\n\nTo all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, and\nthen stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for\ntheir kindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing\nrabble of enchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good\nintentions in coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to\nrepose and withdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the\njoke; as they never thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on\nDon Quixote or cost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement\nto his bed, during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the\nlate one, which his chronicler will not relate just now in order that he\nmay turn his attention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great\ndiligence and drollery in his government.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nWHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW SANCHO PANZA CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN\nHIS GOVERNMENT\n\n\nThe history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to a\nsumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid out\nwith royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the room,\nand four pages came forward to present him with water for his hands,\nwhich Sancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, and Sancho\nseated himself at the head of the table, for there was only that seat\nplaced, and no more than one cover laid. A personage, who it appeared\nafterwards was a physician, placed himself standing by his side with a\nwhalebone wand in his hand. They then lifted up a fine white cloth\ncovering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different sorts; one who\nlooked like a student said grace, and a page put a laced bib on Sancho,\nwhile another who played the part of head carver placed a dish of fruit\nbefore him. But hardly had he tasted a morsel when the man with the wand\ntouched the plate with it, and they took it away from before him with the\nutmost celerity. The carver, however, brought him another dish, and\nSancho proceeded to try it; but before he could get at it, not to say\ntaste it, already the wand had touched it and a page had carried it off\nwith the same promptitude as the fruit. Sancho seeing this was puzzled,\nand looking from one to another asked if this dinner was to be eaten\nafter the fashion of a jugglery trick.\n\nTo this he with the wand replied, \"It is not to be eaten, senor governor,\nexcept as is usual and customary in other islands where there are\ngovernors. I, senor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in this\nisland to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regard\nfor their health than for my own, studying day and night and making\nmyself acquainted with the governor's constitution, in order to be able\nto cure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is to attend\nat his dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be\nfit for him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm and be\ninjurious to his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of fruit to\nbe removed as being too moist, and that other dish I ordered to be\nremoved as being too hot and containing many spices that stimulate\nthirst; for he who drinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture\nwherein life consists.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"that dish of roast partridges there that seems\nso savoury will not do me any harm.\"\n\nTo this the physician replied, \"Of those my lord the governor shall not\neat so long as I live.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"Because,\" replied the doctor, \"our master Hippocrates, the polestar and\nbeacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms omnis saturatio mala,\nperdicis autem pessima, which means 'all repletion is bad, but that of\npartridge is the worst of all.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho, \"let senor doctor see among the dishes that\nare on the table what will do me most good and least harm, and let me eat\nit, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life of the governor,\nand so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I'm dying of hunger; and in\nspite of the doctor and all he may say, to deny me food is the way to\ntake my life instead of prolonging it.\"\n\n\"Your worship is right, senor governor,\" said the physician; \"and\ntherefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of those stewed\nrabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that veal were not\nroasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is out of the\nquestion.\"\n\n\"That big dish that is smoking farther off,\" said Sancho, \"seems to me to\nbe an olla podrida, and out of the diversity of things in such ollas, I\ncan't fail to light upon something tasty and good for me.\"\n\n\"Absit,\" said the doctor; \"far from us be any such base thought! There is\nnothing in the world less nourishing than an olla podrida; to canons, or\nrectors of colleges, or peasants' weddings with your ollas podridas, but\nlet us have none of them on the tables of governors, where everything\nthat is present should be delicate and refined; and the reason is, that\nalways, everywhere and by everybody, simple medicines are more esteemed\nthan compound ones, for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple,\nwhile in the compound we may, by merely altering the quantity of the\nthings composing them. But what I am of opinion the governor should eat\nnow in order to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of\nwafer cakes and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces, which will\nsettle his stomach and help his digestion.\"\n\nSancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the\ndoctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and\nwhere he had studied.\n\nHe replied, \"My name, senor governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I\nam a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel and\nAlmodovar del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree of\ndoctor from the university of Osuna.\"\n\nTo which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, \"Then let Doctor\nPedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that's on the\nright-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodovar del Campo, graduate\nof Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I'll take\na cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I'll not leave a\ndoctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant; for\nas to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and\nhonour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of this\nor I'll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his head. And\nif they call me to account for it, I'll clear myself by saying I served\nGod in killing a bad doctor--a general executioner. And now give me\nsomething to eat, or else take your government; for a trade that does not\nfeed its master is not worth two beans.\"\n\nThe doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and\nhe would have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same\ninstant a post-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his\nhead out of the window turned round and said, \"It's a courier from my\nlord the duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.\"\n\nThe courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from\nhis bosom, placed it in the governor's hands. Sancho handed it to the\nmajordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus: To Don\nSancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own hands or\nthose of his secretary. Sancho when he heard this said, \"Which of you is\nmy secretary?\" \"I am, senor,\" said one of those present, \"for I can read\nand write, and am a Biscayan.\" \"With that addition,\" said Sancho, \"you\nmight be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and see what\nit says.\" The new-born secretary obeyed, and having read the contents\nsaid the matter was one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered the\nchamber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so\nthe doctor and the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the\nletter, which was as follows:\n\n\nIt has come to my knowledge, Senor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies\nof mine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some\nnight, I know not when. It behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch,\nthat they surprise you not. I also know by trustworthy spies that four\npersons have entered the town in disguise in order to take your life,\nbecause they stand in dread of your great capacity; keep your eyes open\nand take heed who approaches you to address you, and eat nothing that is\npresented to you. I will take care to send you aid if you find yourself\nin difficulty, but in all things you will act as may be expected of your\njudgment. From this place, the Sixteenth of August, at four in the\nmorning.\n\nYour friend,\n\nTHE DUKE\n\n\nSancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so too,\nand turning to the majordomo he said to him, \"What we have got to do\nfirst, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the\nlock-up; for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death and\nthe worst of all, which is hunger.\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" said the carver, \"it is my opinion your worship should not\neat anything that is on this table, for the whole was a present from some\nnuns; and as they say, 'behind the cross there's the devil.'\"\n\n\"I don't deny it,\" said Sancho; \"so for the present give me a piece of\nbread and four pounds or so of grapes; no poison can come in them; for\nthe fact is I can't go on without eating; and if we are to be prepared\nfor these battles that are threatening us we must be well provisioned;\nfor it is the tripes that carry the heart and not the heart the tripes.\nAnd you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his\ncommands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me to\nmy lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her not to\nforget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a\nmessenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to\nserve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it\nyou may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he may\nsee I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan you\nmay add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now take\naway this cloth and give me something to eat, and I'll be ready to meet\nall the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against me or my\nisland.\"\n\nAt this instant a page entered saying, \"Here is a farmer on business, who\nwants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he\nsays.\"\n\n\"It's very odd,\" said Sancho, \"the ways of these men on business; is it\npossible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is\nno hour for coming on business? We who govern and we who are judges--are\nwe not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to be allowed the time\nrequired for taking rest, unless they'd have us made of marble? By God\nand on my conscience, if the government remains in my hands (which I have\na notion it won't), I'll bring more than one man on business to order.\nHowever, tell this good man to come in; but take care first of all that\nhe is not some spy or one of my assassins.\"\n\n\"No, my lord,\" said the page, \"for he looks like a simple fellow, and\neither I know very little or he is as good as good bread.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be afraid of,\" said the majordomo, \"for we are all\nhere.\"\n\n\"Would it be possible, carver,\" said Sancho, \"now that Doctor Pedro Recio\nis not here, to let me eat something solid and substantial, if it were\neven a piece of bread and an onion?\"\n\n\"To-night at supper,\" said the carver, \"the shortcomings of the dinner\nshall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully contented.\"\n\n\"God grant it,\" said Sancho.\n\nThe farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousand\nleagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he said\nwas, \"Which is the lord governor here?\"\n\n\"Which should it be,\" said the secretary, \"but he who is seated in the\nchair?\"\n\n\"Then I humble myself before him,\" said the farmer; and going on his\nknees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and bade him\nstand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said, \"I am\na farmer, senor, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues from\nCiudad Real.\"\n\n\"Another Tirteafuera!\" said Sancho; \"say on, brother; I know Miguelturra\nvery well I can tell you, for it's not very far from my own town.\"\n\n\"The case is this, senor,\" continued the farmer, \"that by God's mercy I\nam married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic Church;\nI have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to become\nbachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my wife\ndied, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on my hands,\ngiving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had pleased God\nthat the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put him to\nstudy for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and\nthe licentiate.\"\n\n\"So that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would not\nnow be a widower,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"No, senor, certainly not,\" said the farmer.\n\n\"We've got that much settled,\" said Sancho; \"get on, brother, for it's\nmore bed-time than business-time.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said the farmer, \"this son of mine who is going to be a\nbachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called Clara\nPerlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this\nname of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but\nbecause all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call\nthem Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an\nOriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on the\nright side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an eye\nthat she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and deeply\npitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there, but the\ngraves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so cleanly that\nnot to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as they say, so that\none would fancy it was running away from her mouth; and with all this she\nlooks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth; and but for wanting ten\nor a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with the\ncomeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are so fine and thin that,\nif lips might be reeled, one might make a skein of them; but being of a\ndifferent colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful, for they are\nmottled, blue, green, and purple--let my lord the governor pardon me for\npainting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will be my\ndaughter; for I love her, and I don't find her amiss.\"\n\n\"Paint what you will,\" said Sancho; \"I enjoy your painting, and if I had\ndined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your portrait.\"\n\n\"That I have still to furnish,\" said the farmer; \"but a time will come\nwhen we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you, senor, if I\ncould paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would astonish you;\nbut that is impossible because she is bent double with her knees up to\nher mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she could stand up\nshe'd knock her head against the ceiling; and she would have given her\nhand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can't stretch it out, for\nit's contracted; but still one can see its elegance and fine make by its\nlong furrowed nails.\"\n\n\"That will do, brother,\" said Sancho; \"consider you have painted her from\nhead to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the point without all this\nbeating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.\"\n\n\"I want your worship, senor,\" said the farmer, \"to do me the favour of\ngiving me a letter of recommendation to the girl's father, begging him to\nbe so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not ill-matched\neither in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell the truth, senor\ngovernor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is not a day but the\nevil spirits torment him three or four times; and from having once fallen\ninto the fire, he has his face puckered up like a piece of parchment, and\nhis eyes watery and always running; but he has the disposition of an\nangel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling himself he'd be a\nsaint.\"\n\n\"Is there anything else you want, good man?\" said Sancho.\n\n\"There's another thing I'd like,\" said the farmer, \"but I'm afraid to\nmention it; however, out it must; for after all I can't let it be rotting\nin my breast, come what may. I mean, senor, that I'd like your worship to\ngive me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my bachelor's\nportion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, in short, live\nby themselves, without being subject to the interferences of their\nfathers-in-law.\"\n\n\"Just see if there's anything else you'd like,\" said Sancho, \"and don't\nhold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.\"\n\n\"No, indeed there is not,\" said the farmer.\n\nThe moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizing the\nchair he had been sitting on exclaimed, \"By all that's good, you\nill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don't get out of this at once and\nhide yourself from my sight, I'll lay your head open with this chair. You\nwhoreson rascal, you devil's own painter, and is it at this hour you come\nto ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I have them, you stinking\nbrute? And why should I give them to you if I had them, you knave and\nblockhead? What have I to do with Miguelturra or the whole family of the\nPerlerines? Get out I say, or by the life of my lord the duke I'll do as\nI said. You're not from Miguelturra, but some knave sent here from hell\nto tempt me. Why, you villain, I have not yet had the government half a\nday, and you want me to have six hundred ducats already!\"\n\nThe carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room, which he did with\nhis head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governor should\ncarry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well how to play\nhis part.\n\nBut let us leave Sancho in his wrath, and peace be with them all; and let\nus return to Don Quixote, whom we left with his face bandaged and\ndoctored after the cat wounds, of which he was not cured for eight days;\nand on one of these there befell him what Cide Hamete promises to relate\nwith that exactitude and truth with which he is wont to set forth\neverything connected with this great history, however minute it may be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nOF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH DONA RODRIGUEZ, THE DUCHESS'S DUENNA,\nTOGETHER WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY OF RECORD AND ETERNAL REMEMBRANCE\n\n\nExceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, with\nhis face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws of\na cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.\n\nSix days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay\nawake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora's pursuit of him, he\nperceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key, and\nhe at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make\nan assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the\nfidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. \"No,\" said he, firmly\npersuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud enough to be\nheard), \"the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me\nrenounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved in the core\nof my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady mine,\ntransformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of golden Tagus\nweaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos hold thee\ncaptive where they will; whereer thou art, thou art mine, and where'er I\nam, must be thine.\" The very instant he had uttered these words, the door\nopened. He stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow\nsatin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his face and his moustaches\ntied up, his face because of the scratches, and his moustaches to keep\nthem from drooping and falling down, in which trim he looked the most\nextraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived. He kept his eyes fixed\non the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten and\nunhappy Altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most venerable\nduenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from\nhead to foot. Between the fingers of her left hand she held a short\nlighted candle, while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from\nher eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she\nadvanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly.\n\nDon Quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her\ncostume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witch\nor sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief,\nand he began crossing himself at a great rate. The spectre still\nadvanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the\nenergy with which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he was scared\nby seeing such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight of his;\nfor the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the\nbandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming,\n\"Jesus! what's this I see?\" let fall the candle in her fright, and then\nfinding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling on\nher skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mighty\nfall.\n\nDon Quixote in his trepidation began saying, \"I conjure thee, phantom, or\nwhatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with me.\nIf thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can do I\nwill do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do good to\nall the world, and to this end I have embraced the order of\nknight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to doing\ngood even to souls in purgatory.\"\n\nThe unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fear\nguessed Don Quixote's and in a low plaintive voice answered, \"Senor Don\nQuixote--if so be you are indeed Don Quixote--I am no phantom or spectre\nor soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Dona Rodriguez, duenna of\nhonour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with one of those\ngrievances your worship is wont to redress.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Senora Dona Rodriguez,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you perchance\ncome to transact any go-between business? Because I must tell you I am\nnot available for anybody's purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my\nlady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Senora Dona Rodriguez, if you will\nleave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your\ncandle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you have for\nme and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, all seductive\ncommunications.\"\n\n\"I carry nobody's messages, senor,\" said the duenna; \"little you know me.\nNay, I'm not far enough advanced in years to take to any such childish\ntricks. God be praised I have a soul in my body still, and all my teeth\nand grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, so common in\nthis Aragon country, have robbed me of. But wait a little, while I go and\nlight my candle, and I will return immediately and lay my sorrows before\nyou as before one who relieves those of all the world;\" and without\nstaying for an answer she quitted the room and left Don Quixote\ntranquilly meditating while he waited for her. A thousand thoughts at\nonce suggested themselves to him on the subject of this new adventure,\nand it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in him to expose\nhimself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to his lady; and\nsaid he to himself, \"Who knows but that the devil, being wily and\ncunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, having failed with\nempresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses? Many a time\nhave I heard it said by many a man of sense that he will sooner offer you\na flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed one; and who knows but this\nprivacy, this opportunity, this silence, may awaken my sleeping desires,\nand lead me in these my latter years to fall where I have never tripped?\nIn cases of this sort it is better to flee than to await the battle. But\nI must be out of my senses to think and utter such nonsense; for it is\nimpossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duenna could stir up or\nexcite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in the world. Is\nthere a duenna on earth that has fair flesh? Is there a duenna in the\nworld that escapes being ill-tempered, wrinkled, and prudish? Avaunt,\nthen, ye duenna crew, undelightful to all mankind. Oh, but that lady did\nwell who, they say, had at the end of her reception room a couple of\nfigures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if at work, and\nthose statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety to the\nroom as if they had been real duennas.\"\n\nSo saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not\nallow Senora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it Senora\nRodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of\nDon Quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and night-cap,\nshe was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, \"Am\nI safe, sir knight? for I don't look upon it as a sign of very great\nvirtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.\"\n\n\"I may well ask the same, senora,\" said Don Quixote; \"and I do ask\nwhether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?\"\n\n\"Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?\" said\nthe duenna.\n\n\"Of you and against you I ask it,\" said Don Quixote; \"for I am not\nmarble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o'clock in the morning, but\nmidnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room more secluded\nand retired than the cave could have been where the treacherous and\ndaring AEneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. But give me your hand,\nsenora; I require no better protection than my own continence, and my own\nsense of propriety; as well as that which is inspired by that venerable\nhead-dress;\" and so saying he kissed her right hand and took it in his\nown, she yielding it to him with equal ceremoniousness. And here Cide\nHamete inserts a parenthesis in which he says that to have seen the pair\nmarching from the door to the bed, linked hand in hand in this way, he\nwould have given the best of the two tunics he had.\n\nDon Quixote finally got into bed, and Dona Rodriguez took her seat on a\nchair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off her\nspectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped the\nbedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing\nbut his face visible, and as soon as they had both regained their\ncomposure he broke silence, saying, \"Now, Senora Dona Rodriguez, you may\nunbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart\nand afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste\nears, and aided by compassionate exertions.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" replied the duenna; \"from your worship's gentle and\nwinning presence only such a Christian answer could be expected. The fact\nis, then, Senor Don Quixote, that though you see me seated in this chair,\nhere in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in the attire of a\ndespised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo, and of a\nfamily with which many of the best of the province are connected by\nblood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, I\nknow not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to the\ncourt of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes,\nmy parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality,\nand I would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never been\nsurpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service and returned\nto their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to heaven,\nfor they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an orphan\nwith nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given\nto servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time, without any\nencouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the household fell in\nlove with me, a man somewhat advanced in years, full-bearded and\npersonable, and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself, for he\ncame of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our loves with such secrecy\nbut that they came to the knowledge of my lady, and she, not to have any\nfuss about it, had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother\nRoman Catholic Church, of which marriage a daughter was born to put an\nend to my good fortune, if I had any; not that I died in childbirth, for\nI passed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly\nafterwards my husband died of a certain shock he received, and had I time\nto tell you of it I know your worship would be surprised;\" and here she\nbegan to weep bitterly and said, \"Pardon me, Senor Don Quixote, if I am\nunable to control myself, for every time I think of my unfortunate\nhusband my eyes fill up with tears. God bless me, with what an air of\ndignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as\njet! for in those days they did not use coaches or chairs, as they say\nthey do now, and ladies rode behind their squires. This much at least I\ncannot help telling you, that you may observe the good breeding and\npunctiliousness of my worthy husband. As he was turning into the Calle de\nSantiago in Madrid, which is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the\nCourt, with two alguacils before him, was coming out of it, and as soon\nas my good squire saw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he\nwould turn and accompany him. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to\nhim in a low voice, 'What are you about, you sneak, don't you see that I\nam here?' The alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to\nhim, 'Proceed, senor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my lady\nDona Casilda'--for that was my mistress's name. Still my husband, cap in\nhand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this my\nlady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I rather\nthink, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and drove it into his back with\nsuch force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to the\nground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to rise her up, and the\nalcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all in\ncommotion--I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back on\nfoot, and my husband hurried away to a barber's shop protesting that he\nwas run right through the guts. The courtesy of my husband was noised\nabroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him no peace in the street;\nand on this account, and because he was somewhat shortsighted, my lady\ndismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyond a doubt\nthat brought on his death. I was left a helpless widow, with a daughter\non my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length, however,\nas I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, my lady the\nduchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered to take me with\nher to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, and here as time\nwent by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in the world; she\nsings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots it like a gipsy, reads\nand writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like a miser; of her\nneatness I say nothing, for the running water is not purer, and her age\nis now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five months and three days,\none more or less. To come to the point, the son of a very rich farmer,\nliving in a village of my lord the duke's not very far from here, fell in\nlove with this girl of mine; and in short, how I know not, they came\ntogether, and under the promise of marrying her he made a fool of my\ndaughter, and will not keep his word. And though my lord the duke is\naware of it (for I have complained to him, not once but many and many a\ntime, and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my daughter), he\nturns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reason being that as\nthe deceiver's father is so rich, and lends him money, and is constantly\ngoing security for his debts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in\nany way. Now, senor, I want your worship to take it upon yourself to\nredress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the\nworld says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and\nhelp the unfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected\ncondition of my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said\nshe possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the\ndamsels my lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her\nshoe, and the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and\ngayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come within\ntwo leagues of her. For I would have you know, senor, all is not gold\nthat glitters, and that same little Altisidora has more forwardness than\ngood looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides being not very\nsound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be\nnear her for a moment; and even my lady the duchess--but I'll hold my\ntongue, for they say that walls have ears.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Dona Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?\" asked\nDon Quixote.\n\n\"Adjured in that way,\" replied the duenna, \"I cannot help answering the\nquestion and telling the whole truth. Senor Don Quixote, have you\nobserved the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion of\nhers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and\ncarmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to\nspurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating health\nwherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may thank, first of\nall God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg, by\nwhich all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full, are\ndischarged.\"\n\n\"Blessed Virgin!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"and is it possible that my lady\nthe duchess has drains of that sort? I would not have believed it if the\nbarefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Dona Rodriguez says so,\nit must be so. But surely such issues, and in such places, do not\ndischarge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now that this\npractice of opening issues is a very important matter for the health.\"\n\nDon Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with a\nloud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Dona Rodriguez let the\ncandle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf's\nmouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize\nher by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while some one\nelse, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her petticoats,\nand with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that\nanyone would have felt pity for her; but although Don Quixote felt it he\nnever stirred from his bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive\nthat his turn for a drubbing might be coming. Nor was the apprehension an\nidle one; for leaving the duenna (who did not dare to cry out) well\nbasted, the silent executioners fell upon Don Quixote, and stripping him\nof the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched him so fast and so hard that\nhe was driven to defend himself with his fists, and all this in\nmarvellous silence. The battle lasted nearly half an hour, and then the\nphantoms fled; Dona Rodriguez gathered up her skirts, and bemoaning her\nfate went out without saying a word to Don Quixote, and he, sorely\npinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained alone, and there we will leave\nhim, wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced\nhim to such a state; but that shall be told in due season, for Sancho\nclaims our attention, and the methodical arrangement of the story demands\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED SANCHO IN MAKING THE ROUND OF HIS ISLAND\n\n\nWe left the great governor angered and irritated by that\nportrait-painting rogue of a farmer who, instructed the majordomo, as the\nmajordomo was by the duke, tried to practise upon him; he however, fool,\nboor, and clown as he was, held his own against them all, saying to those\nround him and to Doctor Pedro Recio, who as soon as the private business\nof the duke's letter was disposed of had returned to the room, \"Now I see\nplainly enough that judges and governors ought to be and must be made of\nbrass not to feel the importunities of the applicants that at all times\nand all seasons insist on being heard, and having their business\ndespatched, and their own affairs and no others attended to, come what\nmay; and if the poor judge does not hear them and settle the\nmatter--either because he cannot or because that is not the time set\napart for hearing them-forthwith they abuse him, and run him down, and\ngnaw at his bones, and even pick holes in his pedigree. You silly, stupid\napplicant, don't be in a hurry; wait for the proper time and season for\ndoing business; don't come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for judges are\nonly flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she naturally demands\nof them; all except myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat,\nthanks to Senor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me\ndie of hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of\nlife may God give him and all his kind--I mean the bad doctors; for the\ngood ones deserve palms and laurels.\"\n\nAll who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly,\nand did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and\ngrave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men's wits. At last Doctor\nPedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him have supper that\nnight though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of\nHippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to\nthe approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though\ntime, to his mind, stood still and made no progress, nevertheless the\nhour he so longed for came, and they gave him a beef salad with onions\nand some boiled calves' feet rather far gone. At this he fell to with\ngreater relish than if they had given him francolins from Milan,\npheasants from Rome, veal from Sorrento, partridges from Moron, or geese\nfrom Lavajos, and turning to the doctor at supper he said to him, \"Look\nhere, senor doctor, for the future don't trouble yourself about giving me\ndainty things or choice dishes to eat, for it will be only taking my\nstomach off its hinges; it is accustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef,\nturnips and onions; and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes,\nit receives them squeamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What the\nhead-carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas\n(and the rottener they are the better they smell); and he can put\nwhatever he likes into them, so long as it is good to eat, and I'll be\nobliged to him, and will requite him some day. But let nobody play pranks\non me, for either we are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and\ngood-fellowship, for when God sends the dawn, he sends it for all. I mean\nto govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let\neveryone keep his eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell\nthem 'the devil's in Cantillana,' and if they drive me to it they'll see\nsomething that will astonish them. Nay! make yourself honey and the flies\neat you.\"\n\n\"Of a truth, senor governor,\" said the carver, \"your worship is in the\nright of it in everything you have said; and I promise you in the name of\nall the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worship with\nall zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind of government you\nhave given a sample of to begin with, leaves them no ground for doing or\nthinking anything to your worship's disadvantage.\"\n\n\"That I believe,\" said Sancho; \"and they would be great fools if they did\nor thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding and my Dapple's\nfor that is the great point and what is most to the purpose; and when the\nhour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my intention to purge this\nisland of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle good-for-nothing\nvagabonds; for I would have you know that lazy idlers are the same thing\nin a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up the honey the industrious\nbees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, to preserve to the gentleman\nhis privileges, to reward the virtuous, and above all to respect religion\nand honour its ministers. What say you to that, my friends? Is there\nanything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?\"\n\n\"There is so much in what your worship says, senor governor,\" said the\nmajordomo, \"that I am filled with wonder when I see a man like your\nworship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have none at all),\nsay such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks, very\ndifferent from what was expected of your worship's intelligence by those\nwho sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see something new in\nthis world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the tables turned\nupon them.\"\n\nNight came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governor\nhad supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started with the\nmajordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged with\nrecording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form a\nfair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as fine\na sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had\nbeen traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords. They\nhastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, who\nseeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them\nexclaimed, \"Help, in the name of God and the king! Are men to be allowed\nto rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the\nvery streets?\"\n\n\"Be calm, my good man,\" said Sancho, \"and tell me what the cause of this\nquarrel is; for I am the governor.\"\n\nSaid the other combatant, \"Senor governor, I will tell you in a very few\nwords. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more\nthan a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knows how.\nI was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour, very\nmuch against what my conscience told me. He made off with his winnings,\nand when I made sure he was going to give me a crown or so at least by\nway of a present, as it is usual and customary to give men of quality of\nmy sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and back up swindles, and\nprevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left the house. Indignant at\nthis I followed him, and speaking him fairly and civilly asked him to\ngive me if it were only eight reals, for he knows I am an honest man and\nthat I have neither profession nor property, for my parents never brought\nme up to any or left me any; but the rogue, who is a greater thief than\nCacus and a greater sharper than Andradilla, would not give me more than\nfour reals; so your worship may see how little shame and conscience he\nhas. But by my faith if you had not come up I'd have made him disgorge\nhis winnings, and he'd have learned what the range of the steel-yard\nwas.\"\n\n\"What say you to this?\" asked Sancho. The other replied that all his\nantagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him more\nthan four reals because he very often gave him money; and that those who\nexpected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with a\ncheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners unless they\nknow them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairly\nwon; and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an\nhonest man than his having refused to give anything; for sharpers always\npay tribute to lookers-on who know them.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the majordomo; \"let your worship consider what is to\nbe done with these men.\"\n\n\"What is to be done,\" said Sancho, \"is this; you, the winner, be you\ngood, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred reals\nat once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; and\nyou who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the island\nin idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the day\nto-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years, and\nunder pain of completing it in another life if you violate the sentence,\nfor I'll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman will by my orders;\nnot a word from either of you, or I'll make him feel my hand.\"\n\nThe one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter quitted\nthe island, while the other went home; and then the governor said,\n\"Either I am not good for much, or I'll get rid of these gambling houses,\nfor it strikes me they are very mischievous.\"\n\n\"This one at least,\" said one of the notaries, \"your worship will not be\nable to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he loses every year\nis beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards. On the\nminor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and it is\nthey that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; for in\nthe houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers dare\nnot attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling has become\ncommon, it is better that men should play in houses of repute than in\nsome tradesman's, where they catch an unlucky fellow in the small hours\nof the morning and skin him alive.\"\n\n\"I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said on that\npoint,\" said Sancho.\n\nAnd now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,\n\"Senor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he saw\nthe officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sure proof\nthat he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not been that\nhe stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.\"\n\n\"What did you run for, fellow?\" said Sancho.\n\nTo which the young man replied, \"Senor, it was to avoid answering all the\nquestions officers of justice put.\"\n\n\"What are you by trade?\"\n\n\"A weaver.\"\n\n\"And what do you weave?\"\n\n\"Lance heads, with your worship's good leave.\"\n\n\"You're facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Very good;\nand where were you going just now?\"\n\n\"To take the air, senor.\"\n\n\"And where does one take the air in this island?\"\n\n\"Where it blows.\"\n\n\"Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth;\nbut take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern, and\nsend you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off; I'll make\nhim sleep there to-night without air.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said the young man, \"your worship will make me sleep in gaol\njust as soon as make me king.\"\n\n\"Why shan't I make thee sleep in gaol?\" said Sancho. \"Have I not the\npower to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?\"\n\n\"All the power your worship has,\" said the young man, \"won't be able to\nmake me sleep in gaol.\"\n\n\"How? not able!\" said Sancho; \"take him away at once where he'll see his\nmistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exert his\ninterested generosity on his behalf; for I'll lay a penalty of two\nthousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from the prison.\"\n\n\"That's ridiculous,\" said the young man; \"the fact is, all the men on\nearth will not make me sleep in prison.\"\n\n\"Tell me, you devil,\" said Sancho, \"have you got any angel that will\ndeliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to put upon\nyou?\"\n\n\"Now, senor governor,\" said the young man in a sprightly manner, \"let us\nbe reasonable and come to the point. Granted your worship may order me to\nbe taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, and to be\nshut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if he lets\nme out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don't choose to sleep,\nand choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye, will your\nworship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I don't choose?\"\n\n\"No, truly,\" said the secretary, \"and the fellow has made his point.\"\n\n\"So then,\" said Sancho, \"it would be entirely of your own choice you\nwould keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?\"\n\n\"No, senor,\" said the youth, \"certainly not.\"\n\n\"Well then, go, and God be with you,\" said Sancho; \"be off home to sleep,\nand God give you sound sleep, for I don't want to rob you of it; but for\nthe future, let me advise you don't joke with the authorities, because\nyou may come across some one who will bring down the joke on your own\nskull.\"\n\nThe young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, and\nshortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and said,\n\"Senor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so, but a\nwoman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man's clothes.\" They raised two or\nthree lanterns to her face, and by their light they distinguished the\nfeatures of a woman to all appearance of the age of sixteen or a little\nmore, with her hair gathered into a gold and green silk net, and fair as\na thousand pearls. They scanned her from head to foot, and observed that\nshe had on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with\ngold and pearl; her breeches were of green and gold stuff, and under an\nopen jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a doublet of the finest white\nand gold cloth; her shoes were white and such as men wear; she carried no\nsword at her belt, but only a richly ornamented dagger, and on her\nfingers she had several handsome rings. In short, the girl seemed fair to\nlook at in the eyes of all, and none of those who beheld her knew her,\nthe people of the town said they could not imagine who she was, and those\nwho were in on the secret of the jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho\nwere the ones who were most surprised, for this incident or discovery had\nnot been arranged by them; and they watched anxiously to see how the\naffair would end.\n\nSancho was fascinated by the girl's beauty, and he asked her who she was,\nwhere she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself in that\ngarb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest confusion,\n\"I cannot tell you, senor, before so many people what it is of such\nconsequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be known, that\nI am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom the power of\njealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to modesty.\"\n\nHearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, \"Make the people stand back,\nsenor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with less\nembarrassment.\"\n\nSancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver, and\nthe secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no more,\nthe damsel went on to say, \"I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez\nMazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very\noften to my father's house.\"\n\n\"That won't do, senora,\" said the majordomo; \"for I know Pedro Perez very\nwell, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter; and\nbesides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he comes\nvery often to your father's house.\"\n\n\"I had already noticed that,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"I am confused just now, sirs,\" said the damsel, \"and I don't know what I\nam saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana,\nwhom you must all know.\"\n\n\"Ay, that will do,\" said the majordomo; \"for I know Diego de la Llana,\nand know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he\nhas a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody in\nall this town can speak of having seen his daughter's face; for he keeps\nher so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of\nseeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the damsel, \"and I am that daughter; whether report\nlies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time,\nas you have seen me;\" and with this she began to weep bitterly.\n\nOn seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver's ear, and\nsaid to him in a low voice, \"Something serious has no doubt happened this\npoor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at\nsuch an hour, and one of her rank too.\" \"There can be no doubt about it,\"\nreturned the carver, \"and moreover her tears confirm your suspicion.\"\nSancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated her to tell them\nwithout any fear what had happened her, as they would all earnestly and\nby every means in their power endeavour to relieve her.\n\n\"The fact is, sirs,\" said she, \"that my father has kept me shut up these\nten years, for so long is it since the earth received my mother. Mass is\nsaid at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I have seen but the\nsun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by night; nor do I\nknow what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or even men, except\nmy father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the wool-farmer; whom,\nbecause he came frequently to our house, I took it into my head to call\nmy father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion and the restrictions\nlaid upon my going out, were it only to church, have been keeping me\nunhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to see the world, or at\nleast the town where I was born, and it did not seem to me that this wish\nwas inconsistent with the respect maidens of good quality should have for\nthemselves. When I heard them talking of bull-fights taking place, and of\njavelin games, and of acting plays, I asked my brother, who is a year\nyounger than myself, to tell me what sort of things these were, and many\nmore that I had never seen; he explained them to me as well as he could,\nbut the only effect was to kindle in me a still stronger desire to see\nthem. At last, to cut short the story of my ruin, I begged and entreated\nmy brother--O that I had never made such an entreaty-\" And once more she\ngave way to a burst of weeping.\n\n\"Proceed, senora,\" said the majordomo, \"and finish your story of what has\nhappened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in\nsuspense.\"\n\n\"I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,\" said the\ndamsel; \"for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.\"\n\nThe maiden's beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver's\nheart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and\nthought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of\nthe meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls\nof them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one\nas her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing\npatience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story, and\ntold her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there\nstill remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.\n\nShe, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, \"My\nmisfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brother\nto dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me some night,\nwhen our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he, overcome by my\nentreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in\nclothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he has not a hair\non his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl), to-night,\nabout an hour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our\nyouthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and\nthen, as we were about to return home, we saw a great troop of people\ncoming, and my brother said to me, 'Sister, this must be the round, stir\nyour feet and put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest\nthey recognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;' and so\nsaying he turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in less\nthan six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came\nup and carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shame\nbefore all these people as whimsical and vicious.\"\n\n\"So then, senora,\" said Sancho, \"no other mishap has befallen you, nor\nwas it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning of\nyour story?\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened me,\" said she, \"nor was it jealousy that brought me\nout, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond\nseeing the streets of this town.\"\n\nThe appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one of\nthem had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully confirmed\nthe truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a rich petticoat\nand a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his head was\nuncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of\ngold, so bright and curly was it. The governor, the majordomo, and the\ncarver went aside with him, and, unheard by his sister, asked him how he\ncame to be in that dress, and he with no less shame and embarrassment\ntold exactly the same story as his sister, to the great delight of the\nenamoured carver; the governor, however, said to them, \"In truth, young\nlady and gentleman, this has been a very childish affair, and to explain\nyour folly and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all\nthese tears and sighs; for if you had said we are so-and-so, and we\nescaped from our father's house in this way in order to ramble about, out\nof mere curiosity and with no other object, there would have been an end\nof the matter, and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest\nof it.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the damsel, \"but you see the confusion I was in was\nso great it did not let me behave as I ought.\"\n\n\"No harm has been done,\" said Sancho; \"come, we will leave you at your\nfather's house; perhaps they will not have missed you; and another time\ndon't be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectable damsel\nshould have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and the hen by\ngadding about are soon lost; and she who is eager to see is also eager to\nbe seen; I say no more.\"\n\nThe youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home, and\nthey directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off. On\nreaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately a\nwoman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to\nthem, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at their\ngrace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night\nand without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to their\nyouth.\n\nThe head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and he\nmade up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her\nfather on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he was\na servant of the duke's; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of marrying\nthe youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he resolved\nto open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no\nhusband could be refused to a governor's daughter. And so the night's\nround came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby\nall his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nWHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS WERE WHO FLOGGED\nTHE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT BEFELL THE PAGE WHO\nCARRIED THE LETTER TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA'S WIFE\n\n\nCide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of this\nveracious history, says that when Dona Rodriguez left her own room to go\nto Don Quixote's, another duenna who slept with her observed her, and as\nall duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she followed her\nso silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as\nthe duenna saw her enter Don Quixote's room, not to fail in a duenna's\ninvariable practice of tattling, she hurried off that instant to report\nto the duchess how Dona Rodriguez was closeted with Don Quixote. The\nduchess told the duke, and asked him to let her and Altisidora go and see\nwhat the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote. The duke gave them leave,\nand the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the door of the room and\nposted themselves so close to it that they could hear all that was said\ninside. But when the duchess heard how the Rodriguez had made public the\nAranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself, nor Altisidora\neither; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance, they burst\ninto the room and tormented Don Quixote and flogged the duenna in the\nmanner already described; for indignities offered to their charms and\nself-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eager for\nrevenge. The duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was much\namused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry and\ndiverting herself with Don Quixote, despatched the page who had played\nthe part of Dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which\nSancho Panza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to\nTeresa Panza his wife with her husband's letter and another from herself,\nand also a great string of fine coral beads as a present.\n\nNow the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager\nto serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho's\nvillage. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a\nbrook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a\nwoman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza, squire to a\nknight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a young girl who\nwas washing stood up and said, \"Teresa Panza is my mother, and that\nSancho is my father, and that knight is our master.\"\n\n\"Well then, miss,\" said the page, \"come and show me where your mother is,\nfor I bring her a letter and a present from your father.\"\n\n\"That I will with all my heart, senor,\" said the girl, who seemed to be\nabout fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing to\none of her companions, and without putting anything on her head or feet,\nfor she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, away she\nskipped in front of the page's horse, saying, \"Come, your worship, our\nhouse is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there, sorrowful\nenough at not having had any news of my father this ever so long.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the page, \"I am bringing her such good news that she will\nhave reason to thank God.\"\n\nAnd then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, but\nbefore going into the house she called out at the door, \"Come out, mother\nTeresa, come out, come out; here's a gentleman with letters and other\nthings from my good father.\" At these words her mother Teresa Panza came\nout spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so short was it one\nwould have fancied \"they to her shame had cut it short\"), a grey bodice\nof the same stuff, and a smock. She was not very old, though plainly past\nforty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried; and seeing her daughter\nand the page on horseback, she exclaimed, \"What's this, child? What\ngentleman is this?\"\n\n\"A servant of my lady, Dona Teresa Panza,\" replied the page; and suiting\nthe action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and with great\nhumility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying, \"Let me kiss\nyour hand, Senora Dona Teresa, as the lawful and only wife of Senor Don\nSancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of Barataria.\"\n\n\"Ah, senor, get up, do that,\" said Teresa; \"for I'm not a bit of a court\nlady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of a clodcrusher, and\nthe wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at all.\"\n\n\"You are,\" said the page, \"the most worthy wife of a most arch-worthy\ngovernor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter and this\npresent;\" and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of\ncoral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and said, \"This\nletter is from his lordship the governor, and the other as well as these\ncoral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to your worship.\"\n\nTeresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and the\ngirl said, \"May I die but our master Don Quixote's at the bottom of this;\nhe must have given father the government or county he so often promised\nhim.\"\n\n\"That is the truth,\" said the page; \"for it is through Senor Don Quixote\nthat Senor Sancho is now governor of the island of Barataria, as will be\nseen by this letter.\"\n\n\"Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?\" said Teresa; \"for though I\ncan spin I can't read, not a scrap.\"\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Sanchica; \"but wait a bit, and I'll go and fetch\nsome one who can read it, either the curate himself or the bachelor\nSamson Carrasco, and they'll come gladly to hear any news of my father.\"\n\n\"There is no need to fetch anybody,\" said the page; \"for though I can't\nspin I can read, and I'll read it;\" and so he read it through, but as it\nhas been already given it is not inserted here; and then he took out the\nother one from the duchess, which ran as follows:\n\nFriend Teresa,--Your husband Sancho's good qualities, of heart as well as\nof head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to give\nhim the government of one of his many islands. I am told he governs like\na gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the duke, of course,\nalso; and I am very thankful to heaven that I have not made a mistake in\nchoosing him for that same government; for I would have Senora Teresa\nknow that a good governor is hard to find in this world and may God make\nme as good as Sancho's way of governing. Herewith I send you, my dear, a\nstring of coral beads with gold clasps; I wish they were Oriental pearls;\nbut \"he who gives thee a bone does not wish to see thee dead;\" a time\nwill come when we shall become acquainted and meet one another, but God\nknows the future. Commend me to your daughter Sanchica, and tell her from\nme to hold herself in readiness, for I mean to make a high match for her\nwhen she least expects it. They tell me there are big acorns in your\nvillage; send me a couple of dozen or so, and I shall value them greatly\nas coming from your hand; and write to me at length to assure me of your\nhealth and well-being; and if there be anything you stand in need of, it\nis but to open your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so God keep\nyou.\n\nFrom this place. Your loving friend, THE DUCHESS.\n\n\"Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!\" said Teresa when she heard the\nletter; \"that I may be buried with ladies of that sort, and not the\ngentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they are gentlewomen\nthe wind must not touch them, and go to church with as much airs as if\nthey were queens, no less, and seem to think they are disgraced if they\nlook at a farmer's wife! And see here how this good lady, for all she's a\nduchess, calls me 'friend,' and treats me as if I was her equal--and\nequal may I see her with the tallest church-tower in La Mancha! And as\nfor the acorns, senor, I'll send her ladyship a peck and such big ones\nthat one might come to see them as a show and a wonder. And now,\nSanchica, see that the gentleman is comfortable; put up his horse, and\nget some eggs out of the stable, and cut plenty of bacon, and let's give\nhim his dinner like a prince; for the good news he has brought, and his\nown bonny face deserve it all; and meanwhile I'll run out and give the\nneighbours the news of our good luck, and father curate, and Master\nNicholas the barber, who are and always have been such friends of thy\nfather's.\"\n\n\"That I will, mother,\" said Sanchica; \"but mind, you must give me half of\nthat string; for I don't think my lady the duchess could have been so\nstupid as to send it all to you.\"\n\n\"It is all for thee, my child,\" said Teresa; \"but let me wear it round my\nneck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart glad.\"\n\n\"You will be glad too,\" said the page, \"when you see the bundle there is\nin this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth, that the\ngovernor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for Senora\nSanchica.\"\n\n\"May he live a thousand years,\" said Sanchica, \"and the bearer as many,\nnay two thousand, if needful.\"\n\nWith this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with the\nstring of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the letters as\nif they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and\nSamson Carrasco she began capering and saying, \"None of us poor now,\nfaith! We've got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine lady tackle\nme, and I'll give her a setting down!\"\n\n\"What's all this, Teresa Panza,\" said they; \"what madness is this, and\nwhat papers are those?\"\n\n\"The madness is only this,\" said she, \"that these are the letters of\nduchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck are fine coral\nbeads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and I am a\ngoverness.\"\n\n\"God help us,\" said the curate, \"we don't understand you, Teresa, or know\nwhat you are talking about.\"\n\n\"There, you may see it yourselves,\" said Teresa, and she handed them the\nletters.\n\nThe curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and he\nregarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read,\nand the bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in reply bade\nthem come with her to her house and they would see the messenger, a most\nelegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth as much\nmore. The curate took the coral beads from her neck and examined them\nagain and again, and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he\nfell to wondering afresh, and said, \"By the gown I wear I don't know what\nto say or think of these letters and presents; on the one hand I can see\nand feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on the other I read how a\nduchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns.\"\n\n\"Square that if you can,\" said Carrasco; \"well, let's go and see the\nmessenger, and from him we'll learn something about this mystery that has\nturned up.\"\n\nThey did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page sifting a\nlittle barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be\npaved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome apparel\npleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him courteously,\nand he them, Samson begged him to give them his news, as well of Don\nQuixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had read the\nletters from Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled\nand could not make out what was meant by Sancho's government, and above\nall of an island, when all or most of those in the Mediterranean belonged\nto his Majesty.\n\nTo this the page replied, \"As to Senor Sancho Panza's being a governor\nthere is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he\ngoverns, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town of\nmore than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may tell\nyou my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that, not to\nspeak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has been\nknown to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her neighbours;\nfor I would have your worships know that the ladies of Aragon, though\nthey are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and haughty as the\nCastilian ladies; they treat people with greater familiarity.\"\n\nIn the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full\nof eggs, and said she to the page, \"Tell me, senor, does my father wear\ntrunk-hose since he has been governor?\"\n\n\"I have not noticed,\" said the page; \"but no doubt he wears them.\"\n\n\"Ah! my God!\" said Sanchica, \"what a sight it must be to see my father in\ntights! Isn't it odd that ever since I was born I have had a longing to\nsee my father in trunk-hose?\"\n\n\"As things go you will see that if you live,\" said the page; \"by God he\nis in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government only\nlasts him two months more.\"\n\nThe curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spoke\nin a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the hunting\nsuit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them) did away\nwith the impression; and they could not help laughing at Sanchica's wish,\nand still more when Teresa said, \"Senor curate, look about if there's\nanybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a hooped petticoat, a\nproper fashionable one of the best quality; for indeed and indeed I must\ndo honour to my husband's government as well as I can; nay, if I am put\nto it and have to, I'll go to Court and set a coach like all the world;\nfor she who has a governor for her husband may very well have one and\nkeep one.\"\n\n\"And why not, mother!\" said Sanchica; \"would to God it were to-day\ninstead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw me\nseated in the coach with my mother, 'See that rubbish, that\ngarlic-stuffed fellow's daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease in a\ncoach as if she was a she-pope!' But let them tramp through the mud, and\nlet me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck to backbiters\nall over the world; 'let me go warm and the people may laugh.' Do I say\nright, mother?\"\n\n\"To be sure you do, my child,\" said Teresa; \"and all this good luck, and\neven more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, my daughter, he\nwon't stop till he has made me a countess; for to make a beginning is\neverything in luck; and as I have heard thy good father say many a time\n(for besides being thy father he's the father of proverbs too), 'When\nthey offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; when they offer thee a\ngovernment, take it; when they would give thee a county, seize it; when\nthey say, \"Here, here!\" to thee with something good, swallow it.' Oh no!\ngo to sleep, and don't answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky\nchances that are knocking at the door of your house!\"\n\n\"And what do I care,\" added Sanchica, \"whether anybody says when he sees\nme holding my head up, 'The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,' and the\nrest of it?\"\n\nHearing this the curate said, \"I do believe that all this family of the\nPanzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one of\nthem; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all times\nand on all occasions.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the page, \"for Senor Governor Sancho utters them at\nevery turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose, still\nthey amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly.\"\n\n\"Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho's government is true,\nsenor,\" said the bachelor, \"and that there actually is a duchess who\nsends him presents and writes to him? Because we, although we have\nhandled the present and read the letters, don't believe it and suspect it\nto be something in the line of our fellow-townsman Don Quixote, who\nfancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason I am\nalmost ready to say that I'd like to touch and feel your worship to see\nwhether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh\nand blood.\"\n\n\"All I know, sirs,\" replied the page, \"is that I am a real ambassador,\nand that Senor Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that my\nlord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this same\ngovernment, and that I have heard it said Sancho Panza bears himself\nvery stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in all this or\nnot, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that's all I know\nby the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parents whom I have\nstill alive, and love dearly.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said the bachelor; \"but dubitat Augustinus.\"\n\n\"Doubt who will,\" said the page; \"what I have told you is the truth, and\nthat will always rise above falsehood as oil above water; if not operibus\ncredite, et non verbis. Let one of you come with me, and he will see with\nhis eyes what he does not believe with his ears.\"\n\n\"It's for me to make that trip,\" said Sanchica; \"take me with you, senor,\nbehind you on your horse; for I'll go with all my heart to see my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Governors' daughters,\" said the page, \"must not travel along the roads\nalone, but accompanied by coaches and litters and a great number of\nattendants.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said Sanchica, \"I can go just as well mounted on a she-ass as\nin a coach; what a dainty lass you must take me for!\"\n\n\"Hush, girl,\" said Teresa; \"you don't know what you're talking about; the\ngentleman is quite right, for 'as the time so the behaviour;' when it was\nSancho it was 'Sancha;' when it is governor it's 'senora;' I don't know\nif I'm right.\"\n\n\"Senora Teresa says more than she is aware of,\" said the page; \"and now\ngive me something to eat and let me go at once, for I mean to return this\nevening.\"\n\n\"Come and do penance with me,\" said the curate at this; \"for Senora\nTeresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest.\"\n\nThe page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and the\ncurate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have an\nopportunity of questioning him at leisure about Don Quixote and his\ndoings. The bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa;\nbut she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she\nthought him somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a couple\nof eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for her two\nletters, one for her husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out\nof her own head, which are not the worst inserted in this great history,\nas will be seen farther on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nOF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO'S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH ENTERTAINING\nMATTERS\n\n\nDay came after the night of the governor's round; a night which the\nhead-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the face and\nair and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent what\nwas left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all Sancho\nsaid and did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings, for\nthere was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and\ndeeds. The senor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio's directions\nthey made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold\nwater, which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and\na bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no help for it, he submitted with\nno little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio having\npersuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and that\nwas what was most essential for persons placed in command and in\nresponsible situations, where they have to employ not only the bodily\npowers but those of the mind also.\n\nBy means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger\nso keen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him who had\ngiven it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve he undertook\nto deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came before him\nwas a question that was submitted to him by a stranger, in the presence\nof the majordomo and the other attendants, and it was in these words:\n\"Senor, a large river separated two districts of one and the same\nlordship--will your worship please to pay attention, for the case is an\nimportant and a rather knotty one? Well then, on this river there was a\nbridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where\nfour judges commonly sat to administer the law which the lord of river,\nbridge and the lordship had enacted, and which was to this effect, 'If\nanyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the other he shall declare\non oath where he is going to and with what object; and if he swears\ntruly, he shall be allowed to pass, but if falsely, he shall be put to\ndeath for it by hanging on the gallows erected there, without any\nremission.' Though the law and its severe penalty were known, many\npersons crossed, but in their declarations it was easy to see at once\nthey were telling the truth, and the judges let them pass free. It\nhappened, however, that one man, when they came to take his declaration,\nswore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that\ngallows that stood there, and nothing else. The judges held a\nconsultation over the oath, and they said, 'If we let this man pass free\nhe has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to die; but if we hang him,\nas he swore he was going to die on that gallows, and therefore swore the\ntruth, by the same law he ought to go free.' It is asked of your worship,\nsenor governor, what are the judges to do with this man? For they are\nstill in doubt and perplexity; and having heard of your worship's acute\nand exalted intellect, they have sent me to entreat your worship on their\nbehalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case.\"\n\nTo this Sancho made answer, \"Indeed those gentlemen the judges that send\nyou to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more of\nthe obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so that\nI may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.\"\n\nThe querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then\nSancho said, \"It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment, and\nin this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but\nif he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted\ndeserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him,\nthen he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.\"\n\n\"It is as the senor governor says,\" said the messenger; \"and as regards a\ncomplete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desire or\nhesitate about.\"\n\n\"Well then I say,\" said Sancho, \"that of this man they should let pass\nthe part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in\nthis way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.\"\n\n\"But then, senor governor,\" replied the querist, \"the man will have to be\ndivided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and\nso none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is\nabsolutely necessary to comply with it.\"\n\n\"Look here, my good sir,\" said Sancho; \"either I'm a numskull or else\nthere is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and\npassing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally\ncondemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to\nthe gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him\nand for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass\nfreely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil;\nthis I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what I\nhave said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many\nprecepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to become\ngovernor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this, that\nwhen there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to\nmercy; and it is God's will that I should recollect it now, for it fits\nthis case as if it was made for it.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the majordomo; \"and I maintain that Lycurgus\nhimself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a\nbetter decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning's\naudience close with this, and I will see that the senor governor has\ndinner entirely to his liking.\"\n\n\"That's all I ask for--fair play,\" said Sancho; \"give me my dinner, and\nthen let it rain cases and questions on me, and I'll despatch them in a\ntwinkling.\"\n\nThe majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to\nkill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have\ndone with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was\ncommissioned to practise upon him.\n\nIt came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to\nthe rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking away\nthe cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for the\ngovernor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if\nthere was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The\nsecretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, \"It may\nwell be read aloud, for what Senor Don Quixote writes to your worship\ndeserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as\nfollows.\"\n\n\nDON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA'S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND\nOF BARATARIA.\n\nWhen I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend\nSancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for\nwhich I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the\ndunghill and of fools to make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern as\nif thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is\nthe humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself. But I would have thee\nbear in mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessary for the\nauthority of office to resist the humility of the heart; for the seemly\narray of one who is invested with grave duties should be such as they\nrequire and not measured by what his own humble tastes may lead him to\nprefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like a stick; I do\nnot say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or that being a\njudge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou shouldst array\nthyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that at the same time it\nbe neat and handsome. To win the good-will of the people thou governest\nthere are two things, among others, that thou must do; one is to be civil\nto all (this, however, I told thee before), and the other to take care\nthat food be abundant, for there is nothing that vexes the heart of the\npoor more than hunger and high prices. Make not many proclamations; but\nthose thou makest take care that they be good ones, and above all that\nthey be observed and carried out; for proclamations that are not observed\nare the same as if they did not exist; nay, they encourage the idea that\nthe prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the\npower to enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come\nto be like the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first,\nbut that in time they despised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue\nand a stepfather to vice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient,\nbut observe a mean between these two extremes, for in that is the aim of\nwisdom. Visit the gaols, the slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for\nthe presence of the governor is of great importance in such places; it\ncomforts the prisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release, it is the\nbugbear of the butchers who have then to give just weight, and it is the\nterror of the market-women for the same reason. Let it not be seen that\nthou art (even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe) covetous, a\nfollower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those that have\ndealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bring\ntheir batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have brought\nthee down to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider, con and\ncon over again the advices and the instructions I gave thee before thy\ndeparture hence to thy government, and thou wilt see that in them, if\nthou dost follow them, thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for\nthee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors at every step.\nWrite to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful to them, for\ningratitude is the daughter of pride, and one of the greatest sins we\nknow of; and he who is grateful to those who have been good to him shows\nthat he will be so to God also who has bestowed and still bestows so many\nblessings upon him.\n\nMy lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another\npresent to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every moment. I\nhave been a little indisposed through a certain scratching I came in for,\nnot very much to the benefit of my nose; but it was nothing; for if there\nare enchanters who maltreat me, there are also some who defend me. Let me\nknow if the majordomo who is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi\nperformance, as thou didst suspect; and keep me informed of everything\nthat happens thee, as the distance is so short; all the more as I am\nthinking of giving over very shortly this idle life I am now leading, for\nI was not born for it. A thing has occurred to me which I am inclined to\nthink will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but though I\nam sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obey my calling\nrather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying, amicus\nPlato, sed magis amica veritas. I quote this Latin to thee because I\nconclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it.\nAdieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone.\n\nThy friend, DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.\n\n\nSancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised\nand considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and\ncalling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and\nwithout putting it off any longer set about answering his master Don\nQuixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him\nwithout adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was\nto the following effect.\n\n\nSANCHO PANZA'S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.\n\nThe pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to\nscratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long-God send\na remedy for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be\nsurprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, well or\nill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger than when we\ntwo were wandering through the woods and wastes.\n\nMy lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies\nhad got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not\nfound out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town\nfor killing all the governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro\nRecio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me\ndread dying under his hands. This doctor says of himself that he does not\ncure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the\nmedicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare\nbones; as if leanness was not worse than fever.\n\nIn short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation;\nfor when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and\nmy drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I\nfind I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don't do it\nwillingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.\n\nSo far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don't know\nwhat to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come\nto this island, before entering it have plenty of money either given to\nthem or lent to them by the people of the town, and that this is the\nusual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments.\n\nLast night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man's clothes,\nand a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in\nlove with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife, so he\nsays, and I have chosen the youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to\nexplain our intentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la\nLlana, a gentleman and an old Christian as much as you please.\n\nI have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and\nyesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to\nhave mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I\nconfiscated the whole for the children of the charity-school, who will\nknow how to distinguish them well enough, and I sentenced her not to come\ninto the market-place for a fortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can\ntell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no\npeople worse than the market-women, for they are all barefaced,\nunconscionable, and impudent, and I can well believe it from what I have\nseen of them in other towns.\n\nI am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa Panza\nand sent her the present your worship speaks of; and I will strive to\nshow myself grateful when the time comes; kiss her hands for me, and tell\nher I say she has not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it, as she\nwill see in the end. I should not like your worship to have any\ndifference with my lord and lady; for if you fall out with them it is\nplain it must do me harm; and as you give me advice to be grateful it\nwill not do for your worship not to be so yourself to those who have\nshown you such kindness, and by whom you have been treated so hospitably\nin their castle.\n\nThat about the scratching I don't understand; but I suppose it must be\none of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship;\nwhen we meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could send your worship\nsomething; but I don't know what to send, unless it be some very curious\nclyster pipes, to work with bladders, that they make in this island; but\nif the office remains with me I'll find out something to send, one way or\nanother. If my wife Teresa Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send\nme the letter, for I have a very great desire to hear how my house and\nwife and children are going on. And so, may God deliver your worship from\nevil-minded enchanters, and bring me well and peacefully out of this\ngovernment, which I doubt, for I expect to take leave of it and my life\ntogether, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats me.\n\nYour worship's servant\n\nSANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.\n\n\nThe secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;\nand those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their\nheads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government.\nSancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to\nthe good government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that\nthere were to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men might\nimport wine into it from any place they pleased, provided they declared\nthe quarter it came from, so that a price might be put upon it according\nto its quality, reputation, and the estimation it was held in; and he\nthat watered his wine, or changed the name, was to forfeit his life for\nit. He reduced the prices of all manner of shoes, boots, and stockings,\nbut of shoes in particular, as they seemed to him to run extravagantly\nhigh. He established a fixed rate for servants' wages, which were\nbecoming recklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavy penalties upon\nthose who sang lewd or loose songs either by day or night. He decreed\nthat no blind man should sing of any miracle in verse, unless he could\nproduce authentic evidence that it was true, for it was his opinion that\nmost of those the blind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the\ntrue ones. He established and created an alguacil of the poor, not to\nharass them, but to examine them and see whether they really were so; for\nmany a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe\ncrippled limb or a sham sore. In a word, he made so many good rules that\nto this day they are preserved there, and are called The constitutions of\nthe great governor Sancho Panza.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND DISTRESSED OR AFFLICTED\nDUENNA, OTHERWISE CALLED DONA RODRIGUEZ\n\n\nCide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratches\nfelt that the life he was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent\nwith the order of chivalry he professed, so he determined to ask the duke\nand duchess to permit him to take his departure for Saragossa, as the\ntime of the festival was now drawing near, and he hoped to win there the\nsuit of armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort. But one day\nat table with the duke and duchess, just as he was about to carry his\nresolution into effect and ask for their permission, lo and behold\nsuddenly there came in through the door of the great hall two women, as\nthey afterwards proved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one\nof whom approaching Don Quixote flung herself at full length at his feet,\npressing her lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so\ndoleful that she put all who heard and saw her into a state of\nperplexity; and though the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke\ntheir servants were playing off upon Don Quixote, still the earnest way\nthe woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel\nuncertain, until Don Quixote, touched with compassion, raised her up and\nmade her unveil herself and remove the mantle from her tearful face. She\ncomplied and disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she\ndisclosed the countenance of Dona Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the\nother female in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of\nby the rich farmer's son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment,\nand the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her a\nsimpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazy\npranks. Dona Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress\nsaid to them, \"Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to\nthis gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in order\nto get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an\nevil-minded clown has involved me?\"\n\nThe duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she might\nspeak with Senor Don Quixote as much as she liked.\n\nShe then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said,\n\"Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of the injustice\nand treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter, the\nunhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to take her part and\nright the wrong that has been done her; but now it has come to my hearing\nthat you are about to depart from this castle in quest of such fair\nadventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore, before you take the\nroad, I would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel him to\nmarry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to become her\nhusband before he seduced her; for to expect that my lord the duke will\ndo me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason I stated\nprivately to your worship; and so may our Lord grant you good health and\nforsake us not.\"\n\nTo these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, \"Worthy\nduenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for I\ntake it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it\nwould have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers'\npromises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly\nperformed; and so, with my lord the duke's leave, I will at once go in\nquest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge him and\nslay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for the chief\nobject of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud; I\nmean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.\"\n\n\"There is no necessity,\" said the duke, \"for your worship to take the\ntrouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains,\nnor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave to challenge him;\nfor I admit him duly challenged, and will take care that he is informed\nof the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it in person to\nthis castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair field, observing\nall the conditions which are usually and properly observed in such\ntrials, and observing too justice to both sides, as all princes who offer\na free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships are bound\nto do.\"\n\n\"Then with that assurance and your highness's good leave,\" said Don\nQuixote, \"I hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood, and\ncome down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of the\nwrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter into\ncombat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, on the\nplea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, who was\na maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shall fulfill\nthe promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or else stake his\nlife upon the question.\"\n\nAnd then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall,\nand the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that he\naccepted the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days\nthence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for\narms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour,\nwith all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any\nsort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field. \"But first of\nall,\" he said, \"it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy\ndamsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of Don Quixote;\nfor otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought\nto a lawful issue.\"\n\n\"I do so place it,\" replied the duenna.\n\n\"And I too,\" added her daughter, all in tears and covered with shame and\nconfusion.\n\nThis declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his own\nmind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and\nthe duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated\nas servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her house to\ndemand justice; so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them\nas they would on strangers, to the consternation of the other\nwomen-servants, who did not know where the folly and imprudence of Dona\nRodriguez and her unlucky daughter would stop.\n\nAnd now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a\nsatisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and\npresents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the\nhall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being\nanxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the\npage said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in\na few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait\nfor a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with\nthese letters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess's\nhand. One bore by way of address, Letter for my lady the Duchess\nSo-and-so, of I don't know where; and the other To my husband Sancho\nPanza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than\nme. The duchess's bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she had\nread her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it might\nbe read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out as\nfollows.\n\n\nTERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS.\n\nThe letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for\nindeed I found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine,\nand my husband's hunting suit does not fall short of it. All this village\nis very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good\nman Sancho; though nobody will believe it, particularly the curate, and\nMaster Nicholas the barber, and the bachelor Samson Carrasco; but I don't\ncare for that, for so long as it is true, as it is, they may all say what\nthey like; though, to tell the truth, if the coral beads and the suit had\nnot come I would not have believed it either; for in this village\neverybody thinks my husband a numskull, and except for governing a flock\nof goats, they cannot fancy what sort of government he can be fit for.\nGod grant it, and direct him according as he sees his children stand in\nneed of it. I am resolved with your worship's leave, lady of my soul, to\nmake the most of this fair day, and go to Court to stretch myself at ease\nin a coach, and make all those I have envying me already burst their eyes\nout; so I beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a small\ntrifle of money, and to let it be something to speak of, because one's\nexpenses are heavy at the Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat thirty\nmaravedis a pound, which is beyond everything; and if he does not want me\nto go let him tell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off;\nand my friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a\nfigure and a brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far\nmore by me than I by him, for of course plenty of people will ask, \"Who\nare those ladies in that coach?\" and some servant of mine will answer,\n\"The wife and daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of\nBarataria;\" and in this way Sancho will become known, and I'll be thought\nwell of, and \"to Rome for everything.\" I am as vexed as vexed can be that\nthey have gathered no acorns this year in our village; for all that I\nsend your highness about half a peck that I went to the wood to gather\nand pick out one by one myself, and I could find no bigger ones; I wish\nthey were as big as ostrich eggs.\n\nLet not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take care\nto answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there may be in\nthis place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your highness in his\nkeeping and not to forget me.\n\nSancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship's hands.\n\nShe who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,\n\nYour servant,\n\nTERESA PANZA.\n\n\nAll were greatly amused by Teresa Panza's letter, but particularly the\nduke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote's opinion whether\nthey might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she\nsuspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them he\nwould open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.\n\n\nTERESA PANZA'S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.\n\nI got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a\nCatholic Christian that I was within two fingers' breadth of going mad I\nwas so happy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou\nwert a governor I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and\nthou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as\nfor Sanchica thy daughter, she leaked from sheer happiness. I had before\nme the suit thou didst send me, and the coral beads my lady the duchess\nsent me round my neck, and the letters in my hands, and there was the\nbearer of them standing by, and in spite of all this I verily believed\nand thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream; for who could\nhave thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of islands? Thou\nknowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that one must live long\nto see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I live longer; for\nI don't expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of taxes or a collector\nof revenue, which are offices where, though the devil carries off those\nwho make a bad use of them, still they make and handle money. My lady the\nduchess will tell thee the desire I have to go to the Court; consider the\nmatter and let me know thy pleasure; I will try to do honour to thee by\ngoing in a coach.\n\nNeither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the\nsacristan, can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the whole\nthing is a delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything belonging\nto thy master Don Quixote; and Samson says he must go in search of thee\nand drive the government out of thy head and the madness out of Don\nQuixote's skull; I only laugh, and look at my string of beads, and plan\nout the dress I am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit. I sent\nsome acorns to my lady the duchess; I wish they had been gold. Send me\nsome strings of pearls if they are in fashion in that island. Here is the\nnews of the village; La Berrueca has married her daughter to a\ngood-for-nothing painter, who came here to paint anything that might turn\nup. The council gave him an order to paint his Majesty's arms over the\ndoor of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him in\nadvance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had nothing\npainted, and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things;\nhe returned the money, and for all that has married on the pretence of\nbeing a good workman; to be sure he has now laid aside his paint-brush\nand taken a spade in hand, and goes to the field like a gentleman. Pedro\nLobo's son has received the first orders and tonsure, with the intention\nof becoming a priest. Minguilla, Mingo Silvato's granddaughter, found it\nout, and has gone to law with him on the score of having given her\npromise of marriage. Evil tongues say she is with child by him, but he\ndenies it stoutly. There are no olives this year, and there is not a drop\nof vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company of soldiers passed\nthrough here; when they left they took away with them three of the girls\nof the village; I will not tell thee who they are; perhaps they will come\nback, and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wives\nwith all their blemishes, good or bad. Sanchica is making bonelace; she\nearns eight maravedis a day clear, which she puts into a moneybox as a\nhelp towards house furnishing; but now that she is a governor's daughter\nthou wilt give her a portion without her working for it. The fountain in\nthe plaza has run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish\nthey all lit there. I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind\nabout my going to the Court; and so, God keep thee longer than me, or as\nlong, for I would not leave thee in this world without me.\n\nThy wife,\n\nTERESA PANZA.\n\n\nThe letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and\nthen, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived,\nbringing the one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read out,\nand it raised some doubts as to the governor's simplicity. The duchess\nwithdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in Sancho's village,\nwhich he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance\nunmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which Teresa had\ngiven him as being particularly good and superior to those of Tronchon.\nThe duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave\nher, to describe the end of the government of the great Sancho Panza,\nflower and mirror of all governors of islands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nOF THE TROUBLOUS END AND TERMINATION SANCHO PANZA'S GOVERNMENT CAME TO\n\n\nTo fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for ever\nin the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it everything\nseems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The spring succeeds the\nsummer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the autumn the winter,\nand the winter the spring, and so time rolls with never-ceasing wheel.\nMan's life alone, swifter than time, speeds onward to its end without any\nhope of renewal, save it be in that other life which is endless and\nboundless. Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan philosopher; for there\nare many that by the light of nature alone, without the light of faith,\nhave a comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this\npresent life and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for;\nbut our author is here speaking of the rapidity with which Sancho's\ngovernment came to an end, melted away, disappeared, vanished as it were\nin smoke and shadow. For as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day\nof his government, sated, not with bread and wine, but with delivering\njudgments and giving opinions and making laws and proclamations, just as\nsleep, in spite of hunger, was beginning to close his eyelids, he heard\nsuch a noise of bell-ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the\nwhole island was going to the bottom. He sat up in bed and remained\nlistening intently to try if he could make out what could be the cause of\nso great an uproar; not only, however, was he unable to discover what it\nwas, but as countless drums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of\nthe bells and shouts, he was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear\nand terror; and getting up he put on a pair of slippers because of the\ndampness of the floor, and without throwing a dressing gown or anything\nof the kind over him he rushed out of the door of his room, just in time\nto see approaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons\nwith lighted torches and naked swords in their hands, all shouting out,\n\"To arms, to arms, senor governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island in\ncountless numbers, and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to\nour support.\"\n\nKeeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho\nstood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they\napproached one of them called out to him, \"Arm at once, your lordship, if\nyou would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.\"\n\n\"What have I to do with arming?\" said Sancho. \"What do I know about arms\nor supports? Better leave all that to my master Don Quixote, who will\nsettle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinner that I am, God help\nme, don't understand these scuffles.\"\n\n\"Ah, senor governor,\" said another, \"what slackness of mettle this is!\nArm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come out to\nthe plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right, for\nyou are our governor.\"\n\n\"Arm me then, in God's name,\" said Sancho, and they at once produced two\nlarge shields they had come provided with, and placed them upon him over\nhis shirt, without letting him put on anything else, one shield in front\nand the other behind, and passing his arms through openings they had\nmade, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there he was walled and\nboarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his knees or stir\na single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which he leant to keep\nhimself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixed they bade\nhim march forward and lead them on and give them all courage; for with\nhim for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure to bring\ntheir business to a successful issue.\n\n\"How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?\" said Sancho, \"when I can't\nstir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound so tight to my body\nwon't let me. What you must do is carry me in your arms, and lay me\nacross or set me upright in some postern, and I'll hold it either with\nthis lance or with my body.\"\n\n\"On, senor governor!\" cried another, \"it is fear more than the boards\nthat keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for there is no\ntime to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts grow louder,\nand the danger is pressing.\"\n\nUrged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an\nattempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that he\nfancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like a tortoise\nenclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two kneading-troughs,\nor a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel any\ncompassion for him when they saw him down; so far from that,\nextinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the\ncalls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at\nhim over the shield with their swords in such a way that, if he had not\ngathered himself together and made himself small and drawn in his head\nbetween the shields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor,\nas, squeezed into that narrow compass, he lay, sweating and sweating\nagain, and commending himself with all his heart to God to deliver him\nfrom his present peril. Some stumbled over him, others fell upon him, and\none there was who took up a position on top of him for some time, and\nfrom thence as if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting\nout, \"Here, our side! Here the enemy is thickest! Hold the breach there!\nShut that gate! Barricade those ladders! Here with your stink-pots of\npitch and resin, and kettles of boiling oil! Block the streets with\nfeather beds!\" In short, in his ardour he mentioned every little thing,\nand every implement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a\ncity is warded off, while the bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and\nsuffered all, was saying to himself, \"O if it would only please the Lord\nto let the island be lost at once, and I could see myself either dead or\nout of this torture!\" Heaven heard his prayer, and when he least expected\nit he heard voices exclaiming, \"Victory, victory! The enemy retreats\nbeaten! Come, senor governor, get up, and come and enjoy the victory, and\ndivide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of that\ninvincible arm.\"\n\n\"Lift me up,\" said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice. They helped\nhim to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, \"The enemy I have\nbeaten you may nail to my forehead; I don't want to divide the spoils of\nthe foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I have one, to give me a\nsup of wine, for I'm parched with thirst, and wipe me dry, for I'm\nturning to water.\"\n\nThey rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and he\nseated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue he\nfainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry\nthey had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away had\ncaused them was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked what\no'clock it was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more, and\nin silence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waiting to see\nwhat the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant.\n\nHe got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorely\nbruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed by\nall who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave him a\nloving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears in his\neyes, \"Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils and\nsorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except\nmending your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my\nhours, my days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the\ntowers of ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles,\nand four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;\" and all the while\nhe was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle on the ass,\nwithout a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he, with great\npain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself to the\nmajordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor and\nseveral others who stood by, he said, \"Make way, gentlemen, and let me go\nback to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raise myself\nup from this present death. I was not born to be a governor or protect\nislands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them. Ploughing\nand digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way than defending\nprovinces or kingdoms. 'Saint Peter is very well at Rome; I mean each of\nus is best following the trade he was born to. A reaping-hook fits my\nhand better than a governor's sceptre; I'd rather have my fill of\ngazpacho' than be subject to the misery of a meddling doctor who\ntortures me with hunger, and I'd rather lie in summer under the shade of\nan oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double sheepskin jacket in\nfreedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and dress in sables under\nthe restraint of a government. God be with your worships, and tell my\nlord the duke that 'naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither\nlose nor gain;' I mean that without a farthing I came into this\ngovernment, and without a farthing I go out of it, very different from\nthe way governors commonly leave other islands. Stand aside and let me\ngo; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every one of my ribs is\ncrushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling over me\nto-night.\"\n\n\"That is unnecessary, senor governor,\" said Doctor Recio, \"for I will\ngive your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon make\nyou as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promise your\nworship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whatever you\nlike.\"\n\n\"You spoke late,\" said Sancho. \"I'd as soon turn Turk as stay any longer.\nThose jokes won't pass a second time. By God I'd as soon remain in this\ngovernment, or take another, even if it was offered me between two\nplates, as fly to heaven without wings. I am of the breed of the Panzas,\nand they are every one of them obstinate, and if they once say 'odds,'\nodds it must be, no matter if it is evens, in spite of all the world.\nHere in this stable I leave the ant's wings that lifted me up into the\nair for the swifts and other birds to eat me, and let's take to level\nground and our feet once more; and if they're not shod in pinked shoes of\ncordovan, they won't want for rough sandals of hemp; 'every ewe to her\nlike,' 'and let no one stretch his leg beyond the length of the sheet;'\nand now let me pass, for it's growing late with me.\"\n\nTo this the majordomo said, \"Senor governor, we would let your worship go\nwith all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you, for your\nwit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it is well\nknown that every governor, before he leaves the place where he has been\ngoverning, is bound first of all to render an account. Let your worship\ndo so for the ten days you have held the government, and then you may go\nand the peace of God go with you.\"\n\n\"No one can demand it of me,\" said Sancho, \"but he whom my lord the duke\nshall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I will render an exact\none; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no other proof\nneeded to show that I have governed like an angel.\"\n\n\"By God the great Sancho is right,\" said Doctor Recio, \"and we should let\nhim go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.\"\n\nThey all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bear\nhim company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or for\nthe journey. Sancho said he did not want anything more than a little\nbarley for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself; for the\ndistance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkier\nprovant. They all embraced him, and he with tears embraced all of them,\nand left them filled with admiration not only at his remarks but at his\nfirm and sensible resolution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nWHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS RELATING TO THIS HISTORY AND NO OTHER\n\n\nThe duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for the\nreason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded with;\nand as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled to escape\nhaving Dona Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to substitute\nfor him a Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all carefully\ninstructing him in all he had to do. Two days later the duke told Don\nQuixote that in four days from that time his opponent would present\nhimself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and would maintain that\nthe damsel lied by half a beard, nay a whole beard, if she affirmed that\nhe had given her a promise of marriage. Don Quixote was greatly pleased\nat the news, and promised himself to do wonders in the lists, and\nreckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should have offered for\nletting his noble hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable\nof; and so in high spirits and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of\nthe four days, which measured by his impatience seemed spinning\nthemselves out into four hundred ages. Let us leave them to pass as we do\nother things, and go and bear Sancho company, as mounted on Dapple, half\nglad, half sad, he paced along on his road to join his master, in whose\nsociety he was happier than in being governor of all the islands in the\nworld. Well then, it so happened that before he had gone a great way from\nthe island of his government (and whether it was island, city, town, or\nvillage that he governed he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw\ncoming along the road he was travelling six pilgrims with staves,\nforeigners of that sort that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near\narranged themselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together\nbegan to sing in their own language something that Sancho could not with\nthe exception of one word which sounded plainly \"alms,\" from which he\ngathered that it was alms they asked for in their song; and being, as\nCide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforias the\nhalf loaf and half cheese he had been provided with, and gave them to\nthem, explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to give them.\nThey received them very gladly, but exclaimed, \"Geld! Geld!\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you want of me, good people,\" said Sancho.\n\nOn this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to\nSancho, by which he comprehended they were asking for money, and putting\nhis thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to\nunderstand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging\nDapple forward he broke through them. But as he was passing, one of them\nwho had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, and flinging\nhis arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish, \"God bless\nme! What's this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms my dear\nfriend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza? But there's no doubt about it,\nfor I'm not asleep, nor am I drunk just now.\"\n\nSancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself\nembraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily without\nspeaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim perceiving\nhis perplexity cried, \"What! and is it possible, Sancho Panza, that thou\ndost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper of thy\nvillage?\"\n\nSancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his\nfeatures, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting off\nthe ass threw his arms round his neck saying, \"Who the devil could have\nknown thee, Ricote, in this mummer's dress thou art in? Tell me, who has\nfrenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, where if\nthey catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with thee?\"\n\n\"If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,\" said the pilgrim, \"I am safe; for\nin this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out of the\nroad into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and rest,\nand thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good fellows; I'll\nhave time enough to tell thee then all that has happened me since I left\nour village in obedience to his Majesty's edict that threatened such\nseverities against the unfortunate people of my nation, as thou hast\nheard.\"\n\nSancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they\nwithdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of\nthe road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim's cloaks\nand remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young\nfellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. They\ncarried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least\nwith things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two\nleagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a\ntablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut,\nscraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were past\ngnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty called,\nthey say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener.\nNor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without any\nseasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But what made the\nbest show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for\neach of them produced his own from his alforjas; even the good Ricote,\nwho from a Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman,\ntook out his, which in size might have vied with the five others. They\nthen began to eat with very great relish and very leisurely, making the\nmost of each morsel--very small ones of everything--they took up on the\npoint of the knife; and then all at the same moment raised their arms and\nbotas aloft, the mouths placed in their mouths, and all eyes fixed on\nheaven just as if they were taking aim at it; and in this attitude they\nremained ever so long, wagging their heads from side to side as if in\nacknowledgment of the pleasure they were enjoying while they decanted the\nbowels of the bottles into their own stomachs.\n\nSancho beheld all, \"and nothing gave him pain;\" so far from that, acting\non the proverb he knew so well, \"when thou art at Rome do as thou seest,\"\nhe asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest of them, and with\nnot less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear being uplifted, but the\nfifth it was all in vain, for they were drier and more sapless than a\nrush by that time, which made the jollity that had been kept up so far\nbegin to flag.\n\nEvery now and then some one of them would grasp Sancho's right hand in\nhis own saying, \"Espanoli y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compano;\" and Sancho\nwould answer, \"Bon compano, jur a Di!\" and then go off into a fit of\nlaughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment of\nanything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have very\nlittle sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the wine\nhaving come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them, and\nthey dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth. Ricote and Sancho\nalone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, and Ricote\ndrawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a beech,\nleaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once falling into\nhis own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pure Castilian:\n\n\"Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how the\nproclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against those of\nmy nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,\ninsomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was\nout, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon my\nchildren. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who knows\nthat at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from him, and\nlooks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I say, to\nleave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to seek out\nsome place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way in\nwhich the others took their departure; for I saw very plainly, and so did\nall the older men among us, that the proclamations were not mere threats,\nas some said, but positive enactments which would be enforced at the\nappointed time; and what made me believe this was what I knew of the base\nand extravagant designs which our people harboured, designs of such a\nnature that I think it was a divine inspiration that moved his Majesty to\ncarry out a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some\nthere were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they\ncould make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent to\ncherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it\nwas with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment,\na mild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible\nthat could be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for\nafter all we were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do\nwe find the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all\nthe parts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and\nwelcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not our\ngood fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost all of\nus have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself know the\nlanguage, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave their\nwives and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and\nnow I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of\none's country.\n\n\"I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they gave\nus a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I crossed\ninto Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might live\nwith more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to\ntrifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in most parts they enjoy\nliberty of conscience. I took a house in a town near Augsburg, and then\njoined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great\nnumbers every year to visit the shrines there, which they look upon as\ntheir Indies and a sure and certain source of gain. They travel nearly\nall over it, and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of\nmeat and drink, as the saying is, and with a real, at least, in money,\nand they come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred\ncrowns saved, which, changed into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom\neither in the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim's\ncloaks or by some device of their own, and carry to their own country in\nspite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched. Now\nmy purpose is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried,\nwhich, as it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, and\nto write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I\nknow are at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some French\nport and thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God's will to\ndo with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter\nand Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not\nso much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always\nmy prayer to God that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show\nme how I am to serve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is\nwhy my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to\nFrance, where they could live as Christians.\"\n\nTo this Sancho replied, \"Remember, Ricote, that may not have been open to\nthem, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife's brother took them, and being a true\nMoor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing I can tell\nthee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what thou hast\nleft buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law and thy wife\na great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they brought to be\npassed.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said Ricote; \"but I know they did not touch my hoard, for\nI did not tell them where it was, for fear of accidents; and so, if thou\nwilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take it away and conceal it, I\nwill give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve thy\nnecessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are many.\"\n\n\"I would do it,\" said Sancho; \"but I am not at all covetous, for I gave\nup an office this morning in which, if I was, I might have made the walls\nof my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months were\nover; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would be guilty of\ntreason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go with thee if\ninstead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me four\nhundred here in hand.\"\n\n\"And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?\" asked Ricote.\n\n\"I have given up being governor of an island,\" said Sancho, \"and such a\none, faith, as you won't find the like of easily.\"\n\n\"And where is this island?\" said Ricote.\n\n\"Where?\" said Sancho; \"two leagues from here, and it is called the island\nof Barataria.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Sancho,\" said Ricote; \"islands are away out in the sea; there\nare no islands on the mainland.\"\n\n\"What? No islands!\" said Sancho; \"I tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it\nthis morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a\nsagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a\ndangerous office, a governor's.\"\n\n\"And what hast thou gained by the government?\" asked Ricote.\n\n\"I have gained,\" said Sancho, \"the knowledge that I am no good for\ngoverning, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are\nto be got by these governments are got at the cost of one's rest and\nsleep, ay and even one's food; for in islands the governors must eat\nlittle, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.\"\n\n\"I don't understand thee, Sancho,\" said Ricote; \"but it seems to me all\nnonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands to govern? Is\nthere any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for\ngovernors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, and\nconsider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take away\ntreasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it is so\nlarge), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told thee.\"\n\n\"And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,\" said Sancho;\n\"let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thy\nway in God's name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gain\nmay be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its owner likewise.\"\n\n\"I will not press thee, Sancho,\" said Ricote; \"but tell me, wert thou in\nour village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?\"\n\n\"I was so,\" said Sancho; \"and I can tell thee thy daughter left it\nlooking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her, and\neverybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She wept as she\nwent, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who came\nout to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God and Our\nLady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me weep\nmyself, though I'm not much given to tears commonly; and, faith, many a\none would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off on the\nroad; but the fear of going against the king's command kept them back.\nThe one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the rich\nyoung heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love with her;\nand since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and we all\nsuspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far nothing has\nbeen heard of it.\"\n\n\"I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my daughter,\"\nsaid Ricote; \"but as I felt sure of my Ricota's virtue it gave me no\nuneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou must have heard it said,\nSancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the\nold Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought more of being a\nChristian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself about the\nattentions of this heir.\"\n\n\"God grant it,\" said Sancho, \"for it would be a bad business for both of\nthem; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I want to reach where my\nmaster Don Quixote is to-night.\"\n\n\"God be with thee, brother Sancho,\" said Ricote; \"my comrades are\nbeginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue our journey;\"\nand then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted Dapple, and Ricote leant\nupon his staff, and so they parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nOF WHAT BEFELL SANCHO ON THE ROAD, AND OTHER THINGS THAT CANNOT BE\nSURPASSED\n\n\nThe length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from reaching\nthe duke's castle that day, though he was within half a league of it when\nnight, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This, however, as it was\nsummer time, did not give him much uneasiness, and he turned aside out of\nthe road intending to wait for morning; but his ill luck and hard fate so\nwilled it that as he was searching about for a place to make himself as\ncomfortable as possible, he and Dapple fell into a deep dark hole that\nlay among some very old buildings. As he fell he commended himself with\nall his heart to God, fancying he was not going to stop until he reached\nthe depths of the bottomless pit; but it did not turn out so, for at\nlittle more than thrice a man's height Dapple touched bottom, and he\nfound himself sitting on him without having received any hurt or damage\nwhatever. He felt himself all over and held his breath to try whether he\nwas quite sound or had a hole made in him anywhere, and finding himself\nall right and whole and in perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to\nGod our Lord for the mercy that had been shown him, for he made sure he\nhad been broken into a thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of\nthe pit with his hands to see if it were possible to get out of it\nwithout help, but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold\nanywhere, at which he was greatly distressed, especially when he heard\nhow pathetically and dolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no\nwonder he complained, nor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he was not\nin a very good case. \"Alas,\" said Sancho, \"what unexpected accidents\nhappen at every step to those who live in this miserable world! Who would\nhave said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne,\ngovernor of an island, giving orders to his servants and his vassals,\nwould see himself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him, or\nservant or vassal to come to his relief? Here must we perish with hunger,\nmy ass and myself, if indeed we don't die first, he of his bruises and\ninjuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I'll not be as lucky as\nmy master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the cave of\nthat enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him than\nif he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a table laid\nout and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasant visions, but\nhere I'll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretch that I am,\nwhat an end my follies and fancies have come to! They'll take up my bones\nout of this, when it is heaven's will that I'm found, picked clean, white\nand polished, and my good Dapple's with them, and by that, perhaps, it\nwill be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho\nPanza never separated from his ass, nor his ass from Sancho Panza.\nUnlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should not let us die\nin our own country and among our own people, where if there was no help\nfor our misfortune, at any rate there would be some one to grieve for it\nand to close our eyes as we passed away! O comrade and friend, how ill\nhave I repaid thy faithful services! Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as\nwell as thou canst, to deliver us out of this miserable strait we are\nboth in; and I promise to put a crown of laurel on thy head, and make\nthee look like a poet laureate, and give thee double feeds.\"\n\nIn this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him,\nbut answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the poor\nbeast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter moanings\nand lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived that it was\nwholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help, and he fell to\nbemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there was\nanyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only crying in the\nwilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to\nhear him, and then at last he gave himself up for dead. Dapple was lying\non his back, and Sancho helped him to his feet, which he was scarcely\nable to keep; and then taking a piece of bread out of his alforjas which\nhad shared their fortunes in the fall, he gave it to the ass, to whom it\nwas not unwelcome, saying to him as if he understood him, \"With bread all\nsorrows are less.\"\n\nAnd now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit\na person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass. Sancho\nmade for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and spacious\non the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight that\npenetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He\nobserved too that it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity;\nseeing which he made his way back to where the ass was, and with a stone\nbegan to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short time he had\nmade room for the beast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him\nby the halter, he proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was\nany outlet at the other end. He advanced, sometimes in the dark,\nsometimes without light, but never without fear; \"God Almighty help me!\"\nsaid he to himself; \"this that is a misadventure to me would make a good\nadventure for my master Don Quixote. He would have been sure to take\nthese depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana,\nand would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment\ninto some blooming meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and\nspiritless, expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to\nopen under my feet and swallow me up for good; 'welcome evil, if thou\ncomest alone.'\"\n\nIn this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have\ntravelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived a dim\nlight that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side, showing\nthat this road, which appeared to him the road to the other world, led to\nsome opening.\n\nHere Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in high\nspirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the\nbattle he was to fight with him who had robbed Dona Rodriguez's daughter\nof her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and\ninjury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then, that having sallied\nforth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he would have\nto do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged in the next\nday, as he was putting Rocinante through his paces or pressing him to the\ncharge, he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for reining him in\ntightly it would have been impossible for him to avoid falling into it.\nHe pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer\nexamined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking at it he\nheard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was\nable to make out that he who uttered them was saying, \"Ho, above there!\nis there any Christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman that\nwill take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned\ngovernor?\"\n\nIt struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,\nwhereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as much\nas he could, he cried out, \"Who is below there? Who is that complaining?\"\n\n\"Who should be here, or who should complain,\" was the answer, \"but the\nforlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the\nisland of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha?\"\n\nWhen Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his\nperturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his mind\nthat Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down there;\nand carried away by this idea he exclaimed, \"I conjure thee by everything\nthat as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me who thou art;\nand if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldst have me do\nfor thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour to those that\nneed it in this world, it will also extend to aiding and succouring the\ndistressed of the other, who cannot help themselves.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" answered the voice, \"your worship who speaks to me must\nbe my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from the tone of the voice it\nis plain it can be nobody else.\"\n\n\"Don Quixote I am,\" replied Don Quixote, \"he whose profession it is to\naid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore\ntell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if\nthou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since the devils have not\ncarried thee off, and thou art by God's mercy in purgatory, our holy\nmother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficient to\nrelease thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my part will plead\nwith her to that end, so far as my substance will go; without further\ndelay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou art.\"\n\n\"By all that's good,\" was the answer, \"and by the birth of whomsoever\nyour worship chooses, I swear, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, that I am\nyour squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all my life; but\nthat, having given up my government for reasons that would require more\ntime to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am now, and\nDapple is witness and won't let me lie, for more by token he is here with\nme.\"\n\nNor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sancho\nsaid, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole cave\nrang again.\n\n\"Famous testimony!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"I know that bray as well as\nif I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Wait while I go to the\nduke's castle, which is close by, and I will bring some one to take thee\nout of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee.\"\n\n\"Go, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"and come back quick for God's sake; for\nI cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and I'm dying of fear.\"\n\nDon Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and\nduchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished\nat it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the\nconfirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there\nfrom time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the\ngovernment without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be\nbrief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of\nmany hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of\nthe darkness into the light of day. A student who saw him remarked,\n\"That's the way all bad governors should come out of their governments,\nas this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger,\npale, and I suppose without a farthing.\"\n\nSancho overheard him and said, \"It is eight or ten days, brother growler,\nsince I entered upon the government of the island they gave me, and all\nthat time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour; doctors\npersecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any opportunity of\ntaking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case, as it is, I\ndon't deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but 'man proposes\nand God disposes;' and God knows what is best, and what suits each one\nbest; and 'as the occasion, so the behaviour;' and 'let nobody say \"I\nwon't drink of this water;\"' and 'where one thinks there are flitches,\nthere are no pegs;' God knows my meaning and that's enough; I say no\nmore, though I could.\"\n\n\"Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience and let them\nsay what they like; for trying to stop slanderers' tongues is like trying\nto put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes out of his government\nrich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes out poor, that he has\nbeen a noodle and a blockhead.\"\n\n\"They'll be pretty sure this time,\" said Sancho, \"to set me down for a\nfool rather than a thief.\"\n\nThus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they reached\nthe castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stood\nwaiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke until he had\nfirst put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had passed a very bad\nnight in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to see his lord and\nlady, and kneeling before them he said, \"Because it was your highnesses'\npleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I went to govern your\nisland of Barataria, which 'I entered naked, and naked I find myself; I\nneither lose nor gain.' Whether I have governed well or ill, I have had\nwitnesses who will say what they think fit. I have answered questions, I\nhave decided causes, and always dying of hunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio\nof Tirteafuera, the island and governor doctor, would have it so. Enemies\nattacked us by night and put us in a great quandary, but the people of\nthe island say they came off safe and victorious by the might of my arm;\nand may God give them as much health as there's truth in what they say.\nIn short, during that time I have weighed the cares and responsibilities\ngoverning brings with it, and by my reckoning I find my shoulders can't\nbear them, nor are they a load for my loins or arrows for my quiver; and\nso, before the government threw me over I preferred to throw the\ngovernment over; and yesterday morning I left the island as I found it,\nwith the same streets, houses, and roofs it had when I entered it. I\nasked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket; and though I\nmeant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I was afraid they\nwould not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make\nthem or not to make them. I quitted the island, as I said, without any\nescort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until\nthis morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a\none but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I'd have\nstayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke and\nduchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he\nhas held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give\nanything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world;\nand that point being settled, kissing your worships' feet, and imitating\nthe game of the boys when they say, 'leap thou, and give me one,' I take\na leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don\nQuixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and\ntrembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I'm\nfull, it's all alike to me whether it's with carrots or with partridges.\"\n\nHere Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been\nthe whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when\nhe found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. The\nduke embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up\nthe government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with\nsome other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The\nduchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good\ncare of, as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse\nbruised.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nOF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON\nQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS IN DEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER\nOF DONA RODRIGUEZ\n\n\nThe duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been\nplayed upon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially as\ntheir majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of\nalmost every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the time;\nand to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the\nisland and Sancho's fright and departure, with which they were not a\nlittle amused. After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed\nfor the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly\ninstructed his lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to\nvanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders to have the\nheads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote that Christian\ncharity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer the battle to be\nfought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he must be content\nwith the offer of a battlefield on his territory (though that was against\nthe decree of the holy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the\nsort) and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme limits. Don\nQuixote bade his excellence arrange all matters connected with the affair\nas he pleased, as on his part he would obey him in everything. The dread\nday, then, having arrived, and the duke having ordered a spacious stand\nto be erected facing the court of the castle for the judges of the field\nand the appellant duennas, mother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from\nall the villages and hamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel\nspectacle of the battle; nobody, dead or alive, in those parts having\never seen or heard of such a one.\n\nThe first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of the\nceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there was\nnothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble or\nfall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in\nmantles covering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no\nslight emotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists. Shortly afterwards,\naccompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed that\nthreatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey Tosilos made his\nappearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor down and stiffly\ncased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse was a manifest\nFrieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a hundred of\nwool hanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatant came well\nprimed by his master the duke as to how he was to bear himself against\nthe valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that he must on no\naccount slay him, but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid\nthe risk of killing him, as he was sure to do if he met him full tilt. He\ncrossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were\nplaced stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal\nof the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in\nthe courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the\nduennas, and asked them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha\nshould do battle for their right. They said they did, and that whatever\nhe should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid.\nBy this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery\ncommanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a\nmultitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled\nencounter. The conditions of the combat were that if Don Quixote proved\nthe victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of Dona Rodriguez;\nbut if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise\nthat was claimed against him and from all obligations to give\nsatisfaction. The master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them,\nand stationed them, each on the spot where he was to stand. The drums\nbeat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth trembled under\nfoot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety, some hoping\nfor a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair,\nand lastly, Don Quixote, commending himself with all his heart to God our\nLord and to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, stood waiting for them to give\nthe necessary signal for the onset. Our lacquey, however, was thinking of\nsomething very different; he only thought of what I am now going to\nmention.\n\nIt seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the\nmost beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blind\nboy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to let slip\nthe chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the list\nof his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen, he drove a dart\ntwo yards long into the poor lacquey's left side and pierced his heart\nthrough and through; which he was able to do quite at his ease, for Love\nis invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes, without anyone\ncalling him to account for what he does. Well then, when they gave the\nsignal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the\nbeauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he\npaid no attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike Don Quixote, who\nwas off the instant he heard it, and, at the highest speed Rocinante was\ncapable of, set out to meet his enemy, his good squire Sancho shouting\nlustily as he saw him start, \"God guide thee, cream and flower of\nknights-errant! God give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy\nside!\" But though Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him he never stirred\na step from the spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called\nloudly to the marshal of the field, to whom when he came up to see what\nhe wanted he said, \"Senor, is not this battle to decide whether I marry\nor do not marry that lady?\" \"Just so,\" was the answer. \"Well then,\" said\nthe lacquey, \"I feel qualms of conscience, and I should lay a-heavy\nburden upon it if I were to proceed any further with the combat; I\ntherefore declare that I yield myself vanquished, and that I am willing\nto marry the lady at once.\"\n\nThe marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of\nTosilos; and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of\nthe affair he knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled up in mid\ncareer when he saw that his enemy was not coming on to the attack. The\nduke could not make out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the\nmarshal of the field hastened to him to let him know what Tosilos said,\nand he was amazed and extremely angry at it. In the meantime Tosilos\nadvanced to where Dona Rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, \"Senora, I\nam willing to marry your daughter, and I have no wish to obtain by strife\nand fighting what I can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life.\"\n\nThe valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, \"As that is the case I am\nreleased and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and\nas 'God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.'\"\n\nThe duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up\nto Tosilos he said to him, \"Is it true, sir knight, that you yield\nyourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to\nmarry this damsel?\"\n\n\"It is, senor,\" replied Tosilos.\n\n\"And he does well,\" said Sancho, \"for what thou hast to give to the\nmouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.\"\n\nTosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them to\ncome to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him, and\nhe could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They removed\nit in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze.\nAt this sight Dona Rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry,\nexclaiming, \"This is a trick! This is a trick! They have put Tosilos, my\nlord the duke's lacquey, upon us in place of the real husband. The\njustice of God and the king against such trickery, not to say roguery!\"\n\n\"Do not distress yourselves, ladies,\" said Don Quixote; \"for this is no\ntrickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the bottom\nof it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who, jealous of\nmy reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your husband's features\ninto those of this person, who you say is a lacquey of the duke's; take\nmy advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him, for\nbeyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a husband.\"\n\nWhen the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of\nlaughter, and he said, \"The things that happen to Senor Don Quixote are\nso extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not\none; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage\nfor, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are\nuncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time he\nmay return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters\nentertain against Senor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as it\nis of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and\ntransformations.\"\n\n\"Oh, senor,\" said Sancho, \"those scoundrels are well used to changing\nwhatever concerns my master from one thing into another. A knight that he\novercame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, they turned\ninto the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and a great\nfriend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turned into a\ncommon country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to live and die\na lacquey all the days of his life.\"\n\nHere the Rodriguez's daughter exclaimed, \"Let him be who he may, this man\nthat claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the same, for I had\nrather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a\ngentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind.\"\n\nTo be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos\nbeing shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All\nhailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and\ndisappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously\nwaiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are\ndisappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come\nout, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. The people\ndispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they locked\nup Tosilos, Dona Rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented\nwhen they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage, and Tosilos\nwanted nothing else.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF HOW DON QUIXOTE TOOK LEAVE OF THE DUKE, AND OF WHAT\nFOLLOWED WITH THE WITTY AND IMPUDENT ALTISIDORA, ONE OF THE DUCHESS'S\nDAMSELS\n\n\nDon Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was\nleading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely\nmissed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the\ncountless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a\nknight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to\nheaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke\nand duchess to grant him permission to take his departure. They gave it,\nshowing at the same time that they were very sorry he was leaving them.\n\nThe duchess gave his wife's letters to Sancho Panza, who shed tears over\nthem, saying, \"Who would have thought that such grand hopes as the news\nof my government bred in my wife Teresa Panza's breast would end in my\ngoing back now to the vagabond adventures of my master Don Quixote of La\nMancha? Still I'm glad to see my Teresa behaved as she ought in sending\nthe acorns, for if she had not sent them I'd have been sorry, and she'd\nhave shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfort to me that they can't call\nthat present a bribe; for I had got the government already when she sent\nthem, and it's but reasonable that those who have had a good turn done\nthem should show their gratitude, if it's only with a trifle. After all I\nwent into the government naked, and I come out of it naked; so I can say\nwith a safe conscience--and that's no small matter--'naked I was born,\nnaked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain.'\"\n\nThus did Sancho soliloquise on the day of their departure, as Don\nQuixote, who had the night before taken leave of the duke and duchess,\ncoming out made his appearance at an early hour in full armour in the\ncourtyard of the castle. The whole household of the castle were watching\nhim from the corridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see\nhim. Sancho was mounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and\nproven, supremely happy because the duke's majordomo, the same that had\nacted the part of the Trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two\nhundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of\nthis Don Quixote knew nothing as yet. While all were, as has been said,\nobserving him, suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the\nimpudent and witty Altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic\ntones:\n\nGive ear, cruel knight;\n  Draw rein; where's the need\nOf spurring the flanks\n  Of that ill-broken steed?\nFrom what art thou flying?\n  No dragon I am,\nNot even a sheep,\n  But a tender young lamb.\nThou hast jilted a maiden\n  As fair to behold\nAs nymph of Diana\n  Or Venus of old.\n\nBireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?\n\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\n\nIn thy claws, ruthless robber,\n  Thou bearest away\nThe heart of a meek\n  Loving maid for thy prey,\nThree kerchiefs thou stealest,\n  And garters a pair,\nFrom legs than the whitest\n  Of marble more fair;\nAnd the sighs that pursue thee\n  Would burn to the ground\nTwo thousand Troy Towns,\n  If so many were found.\n\nBireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?\n\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\n\nMay no bowels of mercy\n  To Sancho be granted,\nAnd thy Dulcinea\n  Be left still enchanted,\nMay thy falsehood to me\n  Find its punishment in her,\nFor in my land the just\n  Often pays for the sinner.\nMay thy grandest adventures\n  Discomfitures prove,\nMay thy joys be all dreams,\n  And forgotten thy love.\n\nBireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?\n\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\n\nMay thy name be abhorred\n  For thy conduct to ladies,\nFrom London to England,\n  From Seville to Cadiz;\nMay thy cards be unlucky,\n  Thy hands contain ne'er a\nKing, seven, or ace\n  When thou playest primera;\nWhen thy corns are cut\n  May it be to the quick;\nWhen thy grinders are drawn\n  May the roots of them stick.\n\nBireno, AEneas, what worse shall I call thee?\n\nBarabbas go with thee! All evil befall thee!\n\nAll the while the unhappy Altisidora was bewailing herself in the above\nstrain Don Quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in\nreply to her he turned round to Sancho and said, \"Sancho my friend, I\nconjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast\nthou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this\nlove-sick maid speaks of?\"\n\nTo this Sancho made answer, \"The three kerchiefs I have; but the garters,\nas much as 'over the hills of Ubeda.'\"\n\nThe duchess was amazed at Altisidora's assurance; she knew that she was\nbold, lively, and impudent, but not so much so as to venture to make free\nin this fashion; and not being prepared for the joke, her astonishment\nwas all the greater. The duke had a mind to keep up the sport, so he\nsaid, \"It does not seem to me well done in you, sir knight, that after\nhaving received the hospitality that has been offered you in this very\ncastle, you should have ventured to carry off even three kerchiefs, not\nto say my handmaid's garters. It shows a bad heart and does not tally\nwith your reputation. Restore her garters, or else I defy you to mortal\ncombat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanters changing or altering\nmy features as they changed his who encountered you into those of my\nlacquey, Tosilos.\"\n\n\"God forbid,\" said Don Quixote, \"that I should draw my sword against your\nillustrious person from which I have received such great favours. The\nkerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them; as to the garters\nthat is impossible, for I have not got them, neither has he; and if your\nhandmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, depend upon it she will\nfind them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nor do I mean to be\nso long as I live, if God cease not to have me in his keeping. This\ndamsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, for which I am not to\nblame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of her or of your\nexcellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, and once more\nto give me leave to pursue my journey.\"\n\n\"And may God so prosper it, Senor Don Quixote,\" said the duchess, \"that\nwe may always hear good news of your exploits; God speed you; for the\nlonger you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who\nbehold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastise her that she\nwill not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words.\"\n\n\"One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,\" said\nAltisidora, \"and that is that I beg your pardon about the theft of the\ngarters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I have\nfallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being\nall the while mounted on it.\"\n\n\"Didn't I say so?\" said Sancho. \"I'm a likely one to hide thefts! Why if\nI wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my\ngovernment.\"\n\nDon Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the\nbystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on Dapple,\nhe rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nWHICH TELLS HOW ADVENTURES CAME CROWDING ON DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH NUMBERS\nTHAT THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER NO BREATHING-TIME\n\n\nWhen Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from the\nattentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits to\ntake up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho he said,\n\"Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has\nbestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea\nconceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may and\nshould be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil\nthat can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho, because thou hast\nseen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are\nleaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages\nI felt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger, because I did\nnot enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own; for\nthe sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours\nreceived is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit. Happy\nhe, to whom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound\nto give thanks to any but heaven itself!\"\n\n\"For all your worship says,\" said Sancho, \"it is not becoming that there\nshould be no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that the\nduke's majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry next my\nheart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chance calls; for\nwe shan't always find castles where they'll entertain us; now and then we\nmay light upon roadside inns where they'll cudgel us.\"\n\nIn conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing\ntheir journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a\nleague, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched\nupon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner.\nThey had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some\nobjects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at\nintervals. Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them\ncourteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered.\n\"Senor,\" answered one of the party, \"under these cloths are some images\ncarved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our village;\nwe carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on our\nshoulders that they may not be broken.\"\n\n\"With your good leave,\" said Don Quixote, \"I should like to see them; for\nimages that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.\"\n\n\"I should think they were!\" said the other; \"let the money they cost\nspeak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that\ndoes not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may\njudge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;\" and getting\nup from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, which proved to\nbe one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhing at his feet\nand the lance thrust down its throat with all that fierceness that is\nusually depicted. The whole group was one blaze of gold, as the saying\nis. On seeing it Don Quixote said, \"That knight was one of the best\nknights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was called Don Saint\nGeorge, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let us see this next\none.\"\n\nThe man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his\nhorse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw it\nhe said, \"This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but I\nbelieve he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,\nSancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half of\nit; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have given\nhim the whole of it, so charitable was he.\"\n\n\"It was not that, most likely,\" said Sancho, \"but that he held with the\nproverb that says, 'For giving and keeping there's need of brains.'\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth,\nunderneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains\nseated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors and\ntreading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Ay,\nthis is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is called Don\nSaint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the\nworld ever had or heaven has now.\"\n\nThey then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul\nfalling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in\nrepresentations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in\nsuch lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and Paul\nanswering, \"This,\" he said, \"was in his time the greatest enemy that the\nChurch of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it will ever have;\na knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an untiring labourer\nin the Lord's vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles, whose school was\nheaven, and whose instructor and master was Jesus Christ himself.\"\n\nThere were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up again,\nand said to those who had brought them, \"I take it as a happy omen,\nbrothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights were of\nthe same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there\nis this difference between them and me, that they were saints, and fought\nwith divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight with human ones. They\nwon heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and I, so\nfar, know not what I have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my\nDulcinea del Toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended\nfortunes and a mind restored to itself I might direct my steps in a\nbetter path than I am following at present.\"\n\n\"May God hear and sin be deaf,\" said Sancho to this.\n\nThe men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of\nDon Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant by\nthem. They finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and\nbidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.\n\nSancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master's knowledge, as much\nas if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was no\nstory or event in the world that he had not at his fingers' ends and\nfixed in his memory, and he said to him, \"In truth, master mine, if this\nthat has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it has been\none of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the whole\ncourse of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured and\nundismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth\nwith our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God that he\nhas let me see such a thing with my own eyes!\"\n\n\"Thou sayest well, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but remember all times are\nnot alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the\nvulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural reason,\nwill by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy accidents merely.\nOne of these believers in omens will get up of a morning, leave his\nhouse, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed Saint Francis, and,\nas if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and go home. With another\nMendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom is spilt over his\nheart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of coming misfortunes by\nmeans of such trivial things as these. The wise man and the Christian\nshould not trifle with what it may please heaven to do. Scipio on coming\nto Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his soldiers took it as a bad\nomen; but he, clasping the soil with his arms, exclaimed, 'Thou canst not\nescape me, Africa, for I hold thee tight between my arms.' Thus, Sancho,\nmeeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence.\"\n\n\"I can well believe it,\" said Sancho; \"but I wish your worship would tell\nme what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about to give\nbattle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say 'Santiago and\nclose Spain!' Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needful to close it; or\nwhat is the meaning of this form?\"\n\n\"Thou art very simple, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"God, look you, gave\nthat great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron saint and\nprotector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had with the\nMoors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their defender in\nall their battles; and in these he has been many a time seen beating\ndown, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the Hagarene\nsquadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give thee many\nexamples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.\"\n\nSancho changed the subject, and said to his master, \"I marvel, senor, at\nthe boldness of Altisidora, the duchess's handmaid; he whom they call\nLove must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a little\nblind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking sightless,\nif he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces it\nthrough and through with his arrows. I have heard it said too that the\narrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty\nand reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather\nthan blunted.\"\n\n\"Bear in mind, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that love is influenced by no\nconsideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the same\nnature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the\nhumble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of a\nheart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and\nso without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my\nmind embarrassment rather than commiseration.\"\n\n\"Notable cruelty!\" exclaimed Sancho; \"unheard-of ingratitude! I can only\nsay for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would have\nsubdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a heart of marble,\nwhat bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can't imagine what it\nis that this damsel saw in your worship that could have conquered and\ncaptivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what bold bearing, what\nsprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of these things by\nitself, or what all together, could have made her fall in love with you?\nFor indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at your worship from\nthe sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and I see more to\nfrighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover I have heard say\nthat beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, and as your\nworship has none at all, I don't know what the poor creature fell in love\nwith.\"\n\n\"Recollect, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"there are two sorts of beauty,\none of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind displays and\nexhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable conduct, in\ngenerosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are possible and\nmay exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beauty and not that\nof the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring up suddenly and\nviolently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough that I am not beautiful,\nbut at the same time I know I am not hideous; and it is enough for an\nhonest man not to be a monster to be an object of love, if only he\npossesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.\"\n\nWhile engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood\nthat lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of\nthe kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord\nstretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could\nbe, he said to Sancho, \"Sancho, it strikes me this affair of these nets\nwill prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. May I die if the\nenchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and\ndelay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards Altisidora.\nWell then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green\ncord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith\nthe jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break\nthem as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads.\" But\njust as he was about to press forward and break through all, suddenly\nfrom among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented\nthemselves to his sight--or at least damsels dressed like shepherdesses,\nsave that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade; that is to say,\nthe sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroidered tabby. Their hair,\nthat in its golden brightness vied with the beams of the sun itself, fell\nloose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with\ngreen laurel and red everlasting; and their years to all appearance were\nnot under fifteen nor above eighteen.\n\nSuch was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated Don\nQuixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held all\nfour in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was the\nfirst to speak and said to Don Quixote, \"Hold, sir knight, and do not\nbreak these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, but\nonly for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have been put\nup, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a village some two\nleagues from this, where there are many people of quality and rich\ngentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to\ncome with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends and\nkinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the pleasantest\nin the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral Arcadia among\nourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youths\nas shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the famous poet\nGarcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its own\nPortuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was the\nfirst day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are called\nfield-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that\nfertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these nets in the\ntrees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by the noise we\nmake may fly into them. If you please to be our guest, senor, you will be\nwelcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now neither care nor\nsorrow shall enter.\"\n\nShe held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, \"Of a\ntruth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing in\nthe stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than I at\nthe sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment, and thank\nyou for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve you, you may\ncommand me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession is\nnone other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of\nall conditions, but especially persons of quality such as your appearance\nindicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a small\nspace, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, I would seek\nout new worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that\nye may give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine,\nknow that it is no less than Don Quixote of La Mancha that makes this\ndeclaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached your\nears.\"\n\n\"Ah! friend of my soul,\" instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess, \"what\ngreat good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman we have\nbefore us? Well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and the most\ndevoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world, unless a\nhistory of his achievements that has been printed and I have read is\ntelling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that this good fellow\nwho is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whose drolleries none can\nequal.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho; \"I am that same droll and squire you speak\nof, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the same\nthat's in the history and that they talk about.\"\n\n\"Oh, my friend,\" said the other, \"let us entreat him to stay; for it will\ngive our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heard just\nwhat thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the\nother; and what is more, of him they say that he is the most constant and\nloyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is one Dulcinea del\nToboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is awarded.\"\n\n\"And justly awarded,\" said Don Quixote, \"unless, indeed, your unequalled\nbeauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves the trouble,\nladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my profession do\nnot allow me to take rest under any circumstances.\"\n\nAt this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother\nof one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and as\nrichly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their companion\nwas the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other Sancho his\nsquire, of whom he knew already from having read their history. The gay\nshepherd offered him his services and begged that he would accompany him\nto their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and comply. And now the\ngame was started, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that\ndeceived by the colour fell into the danger they were flying from.\nUpwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as shepherds and\nshepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once informed who Don\nQuixote and his squire were, whereat they were not a little delighted, as\nthey knew of him already through his history. They repaired to the tents,\nwhere they found tables laid out, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly\nfurnished. They treated Don Quixote as a person of distinction, giving\nhim the place of honour, and all observed him, and were full of\nastonishment at the spectacle. At last the cloth being removed, Don\nQuixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:\n\n\"One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is--some will say\npride--but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is\nfull of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I have\nendeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason; and\nif I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by other\ndeeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not enough I make\nthem known publicly; for he who declares and makes known the good deeds\ndone to him would repay them by others if it were in his power, and for\nthe most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give.\nThus, God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver, and the\nofferings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full\nreturn for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree makes up for\nthis deficiency and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for the favour\nthat has been extended to me here, and unable to make a return in the\nsame measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power, offer\nwhat I can and what I have to offer in my own way; and so I declare that\nfor two full days I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading\nto Saragossa, that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here\npresent, are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world,\nexcepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole mistress of my\nthoughts, be it said without offence to those who hear me, ladies and\ngentlemen.\"\n\nOn hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention,\ncried out in a loud voice, \"Is it possible there is anyone in the world\nwho will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? Say,\ngentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise or\nlearned, who could say what my master has said; or is there\nknight-errant, whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that could\noffer what my master has offered now?\"\n\nDon Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with anger\nsaid to him, \"Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the whole world\nwho will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and I know not\nwhat trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who asked thee to meddle in\nmy affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man or a blockhead? Hold\nthy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if he be unsaddled; and\nlet us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that I have\non my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to\nquestion it;\" and in a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, he rose\nfrom his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them feel\ndoubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational\nbeing. In the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involving\nhimself in such a challenge, assuring him they admitted his gratitude as\nfully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his\nvaliant spirit, as those related in the history of his exploits were\nsufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted on\nRocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he\nposted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the\ngreen meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple, together with all the members of\nthe pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his\nvainglorious and extraordinary proposal.\n\nDon Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the\nmiddle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: \"Ho\nye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on\nhorseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two\ndays! Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted here\nto maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs\nthat dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting\naside the lady of my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let him who\nis of the opposite opinion come on, for here I await him.\"\n\nTwice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any\nadventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to\nbetter, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road\na crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all\nriding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had those who were\nwith Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some\ndistance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might\ncome to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and\nSancho Panza shielded himself with Rocinante's hind-quarters. The troop\nof lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to\nDon Quixote, \"Get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls\nwill knock you to pieces!\"\n\n\"Rabble!\" returned Don Quixote, \"I care nothing for bulls, be they the\nfiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once, scoundrels, that\nwhat I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with me in combat.\"\n\nThe herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the way\neven if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks,\ntogether with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be\npenned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed\nover Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all\nto the earth and rolling them over on the ground. Sancho was left\ncrushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very\nsound condition.\n\nThey all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,\nstumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,\nshouting out, \"Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits\nyou, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, 'For a\nflying enemy make a bridge of silver.'\" The retreating party in their\nhaste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more than\nlast year's clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and more\nenraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until Sancho,\nRocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and man\nmounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mock or\nimitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they\ncontinued their journey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS AN\nADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE\n\n\nA clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved Don\nQuixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour\nof the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinante\nloose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man,\nseated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and\ntook out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his mouth\nand bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies were\nrevived. Out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure\npoliteness Sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before\nhim, but waited for his master to act as taster. Seeing, however, that,\nabsorbed in thought, he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth,\nhe said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under\nfoot, began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to\nhis hand.\n\n\"Eat, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"support life, which is of\nmore consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain\nof my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, to\nlive dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what I say,\nlook at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in behaviour,\nhonoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when I looked\nforward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my valiant\ndeeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and crushed\nby the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts my teeth,\nparalyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for food;\nso much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest\ndeath of all deaths.\"\n\n\"So then,\" said Sancho, munching hard all the time, \"your worship does\nnot agree with the proverb that says, 'Let Martha die, but let her die\nwith a full belly.' I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far\nfrom that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather\nwith his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. I'll stretch\nout my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it;\nand let me tell you, senor, there's no greater folly than to think of\ndying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating\nlie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see\nthat when you awake you'll feel something better.\"\n\nDon Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho's\nreasoning was more like a philosopher's than a blockhead's, and said he,\n\"Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee my ease of\nmind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it\nis this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in accordance with thy\nadvice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or\nfour hundred lashes with Rocinante's reins, on account of the three\nthousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of\nDulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left\nenchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.\"\n\n\"There is a good deal to be said on that point,\" said Sancho; \"let us\nboth go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen.\nLet me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is\na hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an ill-nourished and\nworse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, and when she is least\nexpecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and 'until\ndeath it's all life;' I mean that I have still life in me, and the desire\nto make good what I have promised.\"\n\nDon Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, and\nthen they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends\nand comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feed\nunrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.\nThey woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey,\npushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. I\nsay an inn, because Don Quixote called it so, contrary to his usual\npractice of calling all inns castles. They reached it, and asked the\nlandlord if they could put up there. He said yes, with as much comfort\nand as good fare as they could find in Saragossa. They dismounted, and\nSancho stowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him\nthe key. He took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see\nwhat orders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for\nhim, giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for\na castle by his master. Supper-time came, and they repaired to their\nroom, and Sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper.\nTo this the landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had\nonly to ask what he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of\nthe air and the fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.\n\n\"There's no need of all that,\" said Sancho; \"if they'll roast us a couple\nof chickens we'll be satisfied, for my master is delicate and eats\nlittle, and I'm not over and above gluttonous.\"\n\nThe landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.\n\n\"Well then,\" said Sancho, \"let senor landlord tell them to roast a\npullet, so that it is a tender one.\"\n\n\"Pullet! My father!\" said the landlord; \"indeed and in truth it's only\nyesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; but saving pullets ask\nwhat you will.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho, \"you will not be without veal or kid.\"\n\n\"Just now,\" said the landlord, \"there's none in the house, for it's all\nfinished; but next week there will be enough and to spare.\"\n\n\"Much good that does us,\" said Sancho; \"I'll lay a bet that all these\nshort-comings are going to wind up in plenty of bacon and eggs.\"\n\n\"By God,\" said the landlord, \"my guest's wits must be precious dull; I\ntell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wants me to have eggs!\nTalk of other dainties, if you please, and don't ask for hens again.\"\n\n\"Body o' me!\" said Sancho, \"let's settle the matter; say at once what you\nhave got, and let us have no more words about it.\"\n\n\"In truth and earnest, senor guest,\" said the landlord, \"all I have is a\ncouple of cow-heels like calves' feet, or a couple of calves' feet like\ncowheels; they are boiled with chick-peas, onions, and bacon, and at this\nmoment they are crying 'Come eat me, come eat me.\"\n\n\"I mark them for mine on the spot,\" said Sancho; \"let nobody touch them;\nI'll pay better for them than anyone else, for I could not wish for\nanything more to my taste; and I don't care a pin whether they are feet\nor heels.\"\n\n\"Nobody shall touch them,\" said the landlord; \"for the other guests I\nhave, being persons of high quality, bring their own cook and caterer and\nlarder with them.\"\n\n\"If you come to people of quality,\" said Sancho, \"there's nobody more so\nthan my master; but the calling he follows does not allow of larders or\nstore-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of a meadow, and fill\nourselves with acorns or medlars.\"\n\nHere ended Sancho's conversation with the landlord, Sancho not caring to\ncarry it any farther by answering him; for he had already asked him what\ncalling or what profession it was his master was of.\n\nSupper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room,\nthe landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself\ndown to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was\nnext to Don Quixote's, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it,\nhe overheard these words, \"As you live, Senor Don Jeronimo, while they\nare bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of\n'Don Quixote of La Mancha.'\"\n\nThe instant Don Quixote heard his own name, he started to his feet and\nlistened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the\nDon Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \"Why would you have us\nread that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who\nhas read the First Part of the history of 'Don Quixote of La Mancha' to\ntake any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\"\n\n\"For all that,\" said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \"we shall do well\nto read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it.\nWhat displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now\ncured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\"\n\nOn hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his\nvoice and said, \"Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha\nhas forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with\nequal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can\nthe peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have\na place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to\nmaintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\"\n\n\"Who is this that answers us?\" said they in the next room.\n\n\"Who should it be,\" said Sancho, \"but Don Quixote of La Mancha himself,\nwho will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don't\ntrouble a good payer.\"\n\nSancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they\nseemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round\nDon Quixote's neck, said to him, \"Your appearance cannot leave any\nquestion as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your\nappearance; unquestionably, senor, you are the real Don Quixote of La\nMancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in\ndefiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught\nyour achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you\nhas done;\" and with this he put a book which his companion carried into\nthe hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run\nhis eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \"In the little I\nhave seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to\nbe censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the\nnext that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without\narticles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that\nhe goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of\nthe history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza's wife is\ncalled Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa\nPanza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is\ngood reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the\nhistory.\"\n\n\"A nice sort of historian, indeed!\" exclaimed Sancho at this; \"he must\nknow a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari\nGutierrez; take the book again, senor, and see if I am in it and if he\nhas changed my name.\"\n\n\"From your talk, friend,\" said Don Jeronimo, \"no doubt you are Sancho\nPanza, Senor Don Quixote's squire.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Sancho; \"and I'm proud of it.\"\n\n\"Faith, then,\" said the gentleman, \"this new author does not handle you\nwith the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a\nheavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different\nbeing from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master's\nhistory.\"\n\n\"God forgive him,\" said Sancho; \"he might have left me in my corner\nwithout troubling his head about me; 'let him who knows how ring the\nbells; 'Saint Peter is very well in Rome.'\"\n\nThe two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have\nsupper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn\nfit for one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to\ntheir request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew.\nand invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head\nof the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond\nof cow-heel and calves' feet than Sancho was.\n\nWhile at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was\nshe with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty\nand delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Senor Don\nQuixote?\n\nTo this he replied, \"Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more\nfirmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and\nher beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;\" and then he\nproceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment\nof Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos,\ntogether with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment,\nnamely the scourging of Sancho.\n\nExceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from\nhearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if\nthey were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the\nelegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded\nhim as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a\nmaundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts\nbetween wisdom and folly they ought to place him.\n\nSancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X\ncondition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in\nsaid, \"May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got\nhas any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to\nwhat your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard too.\"\n\n\"But he does,\" said Don Jeronimo; \"I cannot remember, however, in what\nway, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as I\ncan see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" said Sancho, \"the Sancho and the Don Quixote of this\nhistory must be different persons from those that appear in the one Cide\nHamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and\ntrue in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard.\"\n\n\"I believe it,\" said Don Juan; \"and were it possible, an order should be\nissued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything\nrelating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as\nAlexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save\nApelles.\"\n\n\"Let him who will paint me,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let him not abuse me;\nfor patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.\"\n\n\"None can be offered to Senor Don Quixote,\" said Don Juan, \"that he\nhimself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the\nshield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.\"\n\nA considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort,\nand though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see\nwhat it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he\ntreated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance\nit should come to its author's ears that he had it in his hand, he did\nnot want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for\nour thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from\nwhat is obscene and filthy.\n\nThey asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to\nSaragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that\ncity every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don\nQuixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the\nring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume,\nthough rich in sillinesses.\n\n\"For that very reason,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will not set foot in\nSaragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this\nnew history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he\nspeaks of.\"\n\n\"You will do quite right,\" said Don Jeronimo; \"and there are other jousts\nat Barcelona in which Senor Don Quixote may display his prowess.\"\n\n\"That is what I mean to do,\" said Don Quixote; \"and as it is now time, I\npray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and\nretain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\"\n\n\"And me too,\" said Sancho; \"maybe I'll be good for something.\"\n\nWith this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to\ntheir room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he\nmade of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly\nconvinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described,\nwere the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and\nbade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room.\nSancho paid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him either to say\nless about the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO BARCELONA\n\n\nIt was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote\nquitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct\nroad to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to\nmake out this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar.\nWell, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for\nsix days, at the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he\nwas overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this\npoint Cide Hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters.\n\nMaster and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had\nsettled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good\nnoontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates of\nsleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger, kept\nawake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through all\nsorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave\nof Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country wench,\nskipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of the sage\nMerlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions to be\nobserved and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.\nHe lost all patience when he considered the laziness and want of charity\nof his squire Sancho; for to the best of his belief he had only given\nhimself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast\nnumber required. At this thought he felt such vexation and anger that he\nreasoned the matter thus: \"If Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot,\nsaying, 'To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,' and yet did not\nfail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor less could\nhappen now in Dulcinea's disenchantment if I scourge Sancho against his\nwill; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho shall receive\nthree thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whether he\ninflicts them himself, or some one else inflicts them, when the essential\npoint is that he receives them, let them come from whatever quarter they\nmay?\"\n\nWith this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante's\nreins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and began\nto untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) by\nwhich his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him Sancho\nwoke up in his full senses and cried out, \"What is this? Who is touching\nme and untrussing me?\"\n\n\"It is I,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I come to make good thy shortcomings\nand relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipe off\nsome portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea is perishing,\nthou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope deferred; therefore\nuntruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in this retired\nspot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Sancho; \"let your worship keep quiet, or else by\nthe living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myself to\nmust be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have no fancy to\nwhip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flog and flap myself\nwhen I have a mind.\"\n\n\"It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;\" and at\nthe same time he strove and struggled to untie him.\n\nSeeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him\nwith all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel stretched\nhim on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on his chest\nheld his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe.\n\n\"How now, traitor!\" exclaimed Don Quixote. \"Dost thou revolt against thy\nmaster and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him who gives thee his\nbread?\"\n\n\"I neither put down king, nor set up king,\" said Sancho; \"I only stand up\nfor myself who am my own lord; if your worship promises me to be quiet,\nand not to offer to whip me now, I'll let you go free and unhindered; if\nnot--\n\nTraitor and Dona Sancha's foe,\nThou diest on the spot.\"\nDon Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not\nto touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely\nfree and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.\n\nSancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about\nto place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his\nhead, and putting up his hands encountered somebody's two feet with shoes\nand stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for another tree,\nwhere the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting,\ncalling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, and\nasked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sancho\nreplied that all the trees were full of men's feet and legs. Don Quixote\nfelt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho, \"Thou\nhast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest\nbut canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that\nhave been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are\nwont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them;\nwhereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;\" and it was, in fact,\nas he supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that the\nfruit hanging on those trees were freebooters' bodies.\n\nAnd now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their\nhearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of\na sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and\nwait until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his horse\nunbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short completely\ndefenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his\nhead and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity.\nThe robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave him a single\nthing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky it\nwas for Sancho that the duke's crowns and those he brought from home were\nin a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that these good folk\nwould have stripped him, and even looked to see what he had hidden\nbetween the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that moment of their\ncaptain, who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly\nbuilt, above the middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion.\nHe was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with\nfour of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist. He\nsaw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were\nabout to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at\nonce obeyed, so the girdle escaped. He wondered to see the lance leaning\nagainst the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and\ndejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself\ncould produce; and going up to him he said, \"Be not so cast down, good\nman, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but\ninto Roque Guinart's, which are more merciful than cruel.\"\n\n\"The cause of my dejection,\" returned Don Quixote, \"is not that I have\nfallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame is bounded by no\nlimits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so great that\nthy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty,\naccording to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be always on\nthe alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee, great\nRoque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield, it would\nnot have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission, for I am Don\nQuixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled the whole world with his\nachievements.\"\n\nRoque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote's weakness was more akin\nto madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard him spoken\nof, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, nor could he\npersuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of\nman; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and test at close\nquarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he said to him,\n\"Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate the position\nin which thou findest thyself; it may be that by these slips thy crooked\nfortune will make itself straight; for heaven by strange circuitous ways,\nmysterious and incomprehensible to man, raises up the fallen and makes\nrich the poor.\"\n\nDon Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise\nas of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at\na furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad\nin green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a\nhat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt\nspurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair of\npistols at his waist.\n\nRoque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, which\ndrawing near thus addressed him, \"I came in quest of thee, valiant Roque,\nto find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune; and not\nto keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not recognise me, I will\ntell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the daughter of Simon Forte,\nthy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel Torrellas, who is thine\nalso as being of the faction opposed to thee. Thou knowest that this\nTorrellas has a son who is called, or at least was not two hours since,\nDon Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the tale of my misfortune, I\nwill tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me. He saw\nme, he paid court to me, I listened to him, and, unknown to my father, I\nloved him; for there is no woman, however secluded she may live or close\nshe may be kept, who will not have opportunities and to spare for\nfollowing her headlong impulses. In a word, he pledged himself to be\nmine, and I promised to be his, without carrying matters any further.\nYesterday I learned that, forgetful of his pledge to me, he was about to\nmarry another, and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth,\nintelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me; my father not being at\nhome I was able to adopt this costume you see, and urging my horse to\nspeed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this, and without\nwaiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him,\nand these two pistols besides, and to the best of my belief I must have\nlodged more than two bullets in his body, opening doors to let my honour\ngo free, enveloped in his blood. I left him there in the hands of his\nservants, who did not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence,\nand I come to seek from thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have\nrelatives with whom I can live; and also to implore thee to protect my\nfather, so that Don Vicente's numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak\ntheir lawless vengeance upon him.\"\n\nRoque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comely\nfigure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, \"Come, senora,\nlet us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will consider what\nwill be best for thee.\" Don Quixote, who had been listening to what\nClaudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her, exclaimed, \"Nobody\nneed trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for I take it upon\nmyself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in\nquest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep his word\nplighted to so great beauty.\"\n\n\"Nobody need have any doubt about that,\" said Sancho, \"for my master has\na very happy knack of matchmaking; it's not many days since he forced\nanother man to marry, who in the same way backed out of his promise to\nanother maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters\nchanging the man's proper shape into a lacquey's the said maiden would\nnot be one this minute.\"\n\nRoque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia's adventure than\nto the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering his\nsquires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, he\ndirected them to return to the place where they had been quartered during\nthe night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of the\nwounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where Claudia met\nhim, but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood; looking all round,\nhowever, they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them, and\nconcluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was Don Vicente, whom\neither dead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds\nor to bury him. They made haste to overtake them, which, as the party\nmoved slowly, they were able to do with ease. They found Don Vicente in\nthe arms of his servants, whom he was entreating in a broken feeble voice\nto leave him there to die, as the pain of his wounds would not suffer him\nto go any farther. Claudia and Roque threw themselves off their horses\nand advanced towards him; the servants were overawed by the appearance of\nRoque, and Claudia was moved by the sight of Don Vicente, and going up to\nhim half tenderly half sternly, she seized his hand and said to him,\n\"Hadst thou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come\nto this pass.\"\n\nThe wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognising\nClaudia said, \"I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is thou\nthat hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings\ntowards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee in thought\nor deed.\"\n\n\"It is not true, then,\" said Claudia, \"that thou wert going this morning\nto marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?\"\n\n\"Assuredly not,\" replied Don Vicente; \"my cruel fortune must have carried\nthose tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take my life; and\nto assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me for thy husband if\nthou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee for the wrong thou\nfanciest thou hast received from me.\"\n\nClaudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she lay\nfainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm seized\nthe same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do; the\nservants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and brought some and\nbathed them with it. Claudia recovered from her fainting fit, but not so\nDon Vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him, for his life had\ncome to an end. On perceiving this, Claudia, when she had convinced\nherself that her beloved husband was no more, rent the air with her sighs\nand made the heavens ring with her lamentations; she tore her hair and\nscattered it to the winds, she beat her face with her hands and showed\nall the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an\nafflicted heart. \"Cruel, reckless woman!\" she cried, \"how easily wert\nthou moved to carry out a thought so wicked! O furious force of jealousy,\nto what desperate lengths dost thou lead those that give thee lodging in\ntheir bosoms! O husband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee\nfrom the marriage bed to the grave!\"\n\nSo vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they\ndrew tears from Roque's eyes, unused as they were to shed them on any\noccasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and\nthe whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. In\nthe end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente's servants to carry his body\nto his father's village, which was close by, for burial. Claudia told him\nshe meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess, where\nshe intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse. He\napplauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany her\nwhithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmen\nof Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him. Claudia\nwould not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him for\nhis offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. The servants\nof Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roque returned to his comrades,\nand so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima; but what wonder, when it was\nthe insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad\nstory?\n\nRoque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered\nthem, and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a\nharangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full\nof peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were\nGascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression\non them. Roque on coming up asked Sancho if his men had returned and\nrestored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped off Dapple.\nSancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were worth three\ncities were missing.\n\n\"What are you talking about, man?\" said one of the bystanders; \"I have\ngot them, and they are not worth three reals.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote; \"but my squire values them at the rate\nhe says, as having been given me by the person who gave them.\"\n\nRoque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men\nfall in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that\nthey had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a\nhasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he\nmade shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no\ncase did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.\n\nWhen this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to Don\nQuixote, \"If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these\nfellows there would be no living with them.\"\n\nUpon this Sancho remarked, \"From what I have seen here, justice is such a\ngood thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves\nthemselves.\"\n\nOne of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his harquebuss\nwould no doubt have broken Sancho's head with it had not Roque Guinart\ncalled out to him to hold his hand. Sancho was frightened out of his\nwits, and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in the company of\nthese people.\n\nAt this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels\non the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to\ntheir chief, came up and said, \"Senor, there is a great troop of people\nnot far off coming along the road to Barcelona.\"\n\nTo which Roque replied, \"Hast thou made out whether they are of the sort\nthat are after us, or of the sort we are after?\"\n\n\"The sort we are after,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Well then, away with you all,\" said Roque, \"and bring them here to me at\nonce without letting one of them escape.\"\n\nThey obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves,\nwaited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting Roque\nsaid to Don Quixote, \"It must seem a strange sort of life to Senor Don\nQuixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents, and all\nfull of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, for in truth\nI must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours.\nWhat led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance, which is strong\nenough to disturb the quietest hearts. I am by nature tender-hearted and\nkindly, but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was\ndone me so overturns all my better impulses that I keep on in this way of\nlife in spite of what conscience tells me; and as one depth calls to\nanother, and one sin to another sin, revenges have linked themselves\ntogether, and I have taken upon myself not only my own but those of\nothers: it pleases God, however, that, though I see myself in this maze\nof entanglements, I do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching\na safe port.\"\n\nDon Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and just\nsentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such\ntrades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone\ncapable of a virtuous thought, and he said in reply, \"Senor Roque, the\nbeginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man's\nwillingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you are\nsick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking God,\nwho is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure you, and\ncure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides, sinners of\ndiscernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools; and as your\nworship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have to do is to\nkeep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience will\nbe strengthened. And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and\nput yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will\nshow you how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many\nhardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances\nthey will lodge you in heaven in a trice.\"\n\nRoque laughed at Don Quixote's exhortation, and changing the conversation\nhe related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which Sancho was\nextremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman's beauty,\nboldness, and spirit at all amiss.\n\nAnd now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with\nthem two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full\nof women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on\nthem, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them. The\nsquires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintaining\nprofound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak. He asked\nthe gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money they\ncarried with them; \"Senor,\" replied one of them, \"we are two captains of\nSpanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we are on our way to\nembark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona under orders for\nSicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, with which we are,\naccording to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier's poverty\ndoes not allow a more extensive hoard.\"\n\nRoque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains,\nand was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that\nbetween them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who was in\nthe coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of\nthe men on horseback replied, \"The persons in the coach are my lady Dona\nGuiomar de Quinones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her\nlittle daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in\nattendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.\"\n\n\"So then,\" said Roque Guinart, \"we have got here nine hundred crowns and\nsixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls\nto each, for I am a bad arithmetician.\" As soon as the robbers heard this\nthey raised a shout of \"Long life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the\nlladres that seek his ruin!\"\n\nThe captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent's lady was\ndowncast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property\nconfiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but he\nhad no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshot\noff, and turning to the captains he said, \"Sirs, will your worships be\npleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her ladyship the\nregent's wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for 'it is by\nhis singing the abbot gets his dinner;' and then you may at once proceed\non your journey, free and unhindered, with a safe-conduct which I shall\ngive you, so that if you come across any other bands of mine that I have\nscattered in these parts, they may do you no harm; for I have no\nintention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any woman, especially one of\nquality.\"\n\nProfuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the\ncaptains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such they\nregarded his leaving them their own money. Senora Dona Guiomar de\nQuinones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and\nhands of the great Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; so\nfar from that, he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under\npressure of the inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. The\nregent's lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that\nhad been assessed as her share at once, for the captains had already paid\ndown their sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their\nlittle hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and turning to his men he\nsaid, \"Of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over; let\nten be given to these pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squire\nthat he may be able to speak favourably of this adventure;\" and then\nhaving writing materials, with which he always went provided, brought to\nhim, he gave them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his bands;\nand bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at\nhis magnanimity, his generous disposition, and his unusual conduct, and\ninclined to regard him as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious\nrobber.\n\nOne of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, \"This\ncaptain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to\nbe so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not\nours.\"\n\nThe unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him, and\ndrawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, \"That is the way\nI punish impudent saucy fellows.\" They were all taken aback, and not one\nof them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him. Roque\nthen withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at\nBarcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the\nknight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, he\nassured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four\ndays from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist's Day, he\nwas going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse Rocinante,\ntogether with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of the strand of\nthe city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the Niarros,\nthat they might divert themselves with him. He wished, he said, his\nenemies the Cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was\nimpossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of Don Quixote and the\nhumours of his squire Sancho Panza could not help giving general pleasure\nto all the world. He despatched the letter by one of his squires, who,\nexchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant, made his\nway into Barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nOF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER\nMATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUS\n\n\nDon Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he\npassed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and\nwonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, at\ndinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom, at\nother times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept standing,\nbreaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There was nothing\nbut sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and blowing the\nmatches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for almost all used\nflintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from his\nmen, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations\nthe viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and\nuneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his\nown men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth,\na weary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and\nsecret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires,\nset out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint John's Eve during\nthe night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he\npresented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then given),\nleft them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.\n\nRoque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he was,\nwaiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fair\nAurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening the\ngrass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came\nat the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and\na tramp, tramp, and cries of \"Clear the way there!\" of some runners, that\nseemed to issue from the city.\n\nThe dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler\nbegan to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote and\nSancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then\nunseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much\nmore so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha. They\nsaw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed\nthemselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze\nand kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and\nclarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious\nwarlike notes. Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish\nupon the calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and\nin showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a\nsomewhat similar movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a\nceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts of the city returned,\nand the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to\nwhich the gangway guns of the galleys replied. The bright sea, the\nsmiling earth, the clear air--though at times darkened by the smoke of\nthe guns--all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.\nSancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved\nover the sea had so many feet.\n\nAnd now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and\noutlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and\nwondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing\nhim exclaimed, \"Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of\nall knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don\nQuixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that\nthese latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the\nlegitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of\nhistorians, has described to us!\"\n\nDon Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but\nwheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don\nQuixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, \"These gentlemen have plainly\nrecognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even that\nnewly printed one by the Aragonese.\"\n\nThe cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said,\n\"Come with us, Senor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and\ngreat friends of Roque Guinart's;\" to which Don Quixote returned, \"If\ncourtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly\nakin to the great Roque's; carry me where you please; I will have no will\nbut yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service.\"\n\nThe cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in\naround him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the\nclarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, who is\nthe author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked\none, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins\nshould force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them\nDapple's tail and the other Rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under\neach. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish\nby pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of\ncapers, they flung their masters to the ground. Don Quixote, covered with\nshame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade's\ntail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple. His conductors tried to\npunish the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing\nso, for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were\nfollowing them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more, and with the\nsame music and acclamations reached their conductor's house, which was\nlarge and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; and there for the\npresent we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete's pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nWHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD, TOGETHER WITH OTHER\nTRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLD\n\n\nDon Quixote's host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of\nwealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair\nand good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set about\ndevising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless\nfashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth\nanything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make Don\nQuixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we\nhave already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony\noverhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the\ncrowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The\ncavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him\nalone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and\nSancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not,\nhe had fallen upon another Camacho's wedding, another house like Don\nDiego de Miranda's, another castle like the duke's. Some of Don Antonio's\nfriends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and\ntreated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in\nconsequence could not contain himself for satisfaction. Such were the\ndrolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who\nheard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don Antonio\nsaid to him, \"We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar\nblanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in\nyour bosom for the next day.\"\n\n\"No, senor, that's not true,\" said Sancho, \"for I am more cleanly than\ngreedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used to\nlive for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so\nhappens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat\nwhat I'm given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but whoever\nsays that I'm an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him\nthat he is wrong; and I'd put it in a different way if I did not respect\nthe honourable beards that are at the table.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Don Quixote, \"Sancho's moderation and cleanliness in\neating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in\neternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungry\nthere is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at a\ngreat pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is always mindful\nof; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, so much so\nthat he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.\"\n\n\"What!\" said Don Antonio, \"has Sancho been a governor?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Sancho, \"and of an island called Barataria. I governed it to\nperfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to\nlook down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by\ntaking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead,\nand out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.\"\n\nDon Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of\nSancho's government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.\n\nOn the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,\npassed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way\nof furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal\nof the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the\nRoman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio\ntraversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table\nseveral times, and then said, \"Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am\nsatisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I\nwill tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking\nstrange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep\nwhat I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.\"\n\n\"I swear it,\" said Don Quixote, \"and for greater security I will put a\nflag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio\" (he had\nby this time learned his name), \"that you are addressing one who, though\nhe has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely\ntransfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that\nyou have consigned it to the depths of silence.\"\n\n\"In reliance upon that promise,\" said Don Antonio, \"I will astonish you\nwith what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the\nvexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for\nthey are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.\"\n\nDon Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such\nprecautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the\nbronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it\nstood, and then said, \"This head, Senor Don Quixote, has been made and\nfabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever\nsaw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of\nwhom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and for a\nconsideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this\nhead, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions\nare put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he traced\nfigures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and at\nlength brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on\nFridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day.\nIn the interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it;\nand I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth.\"\n\nDon Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was\ninclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had\nto wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except that\nhe thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They then\nquitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired to the\nchamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the meantime\nSancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that\nhad happened his master.\n\nThat afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour\nbut in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at\nthat season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the\nservants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don\nQuixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace\nand handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back,\nwithout his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote\nin large letters, \"This is Don Quixote of La Mancha.\" As they set out\nupon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to\nsee him, and as they read out, \"This is Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" Don\nQuixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his\nname, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his\nside, he observed to him, \"Great are the privileges knight-errantry\ninvolves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every\nregion of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city\nknow me without ever having seen me.\"\n\n\"True, Senor Don Quixote,\" returned Don Antonio; \"for as fire cannot be\nhidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that\nwhich is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above\nall others.\"\n\nIt came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the\nacclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the\ninscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \"The devil take thee\nfor a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead of the\ncountless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if\nthou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would\nnot be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of\nall who have anything to do with thee or say to thee. Why, look at these\ngentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see after\nthy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries\nthat are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits.\"\n\n\"Go your own way, brother,\" said Don Antonio, \"and don't offer advice to\nthose who don't ask you for it. Senor Don Quixote is in his full senses,\nand we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured\nwherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don't meddle where\nyou are not wanted.\"\n\n\"By God, your worship is right,\" replied the Castilian; \"for to advise\nthis good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it fills\nme with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in everything\nshould dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry; but may the\nbad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my descendants, if, from\nthis day forth, though I should live longer than Methuselah, I ever give\nadvice to anybody even if he asks me for it.\"\n\nThe advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but\nso great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that\nDon Antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something\nelse.\n\nNight came and they went home, and there was a ladies' dancing party, for\nDon Antonio's wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had\ninvited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and amuse\nthemselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came, they supped\nsumptuously, the dance began at about ten o'clock. Among the ladies were\ntwo of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest,\nsomewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion's sake. These two\nwere so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance that they tired\nhim down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sight to see the\nfigure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments\nclinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile.\n\nThe gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly\nrepelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he\nlifted up his voice and exclaimed, \"Fugite, partes adversae! Leave me in\npeace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she\nwho is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers none but\nhers to lead me captive and subdue me;\" and so saying he sat down on the\nfloor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this\nexertion in the dance.\n\nDon Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and\nthe first that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, \"In an\nevil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men\nof valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you\ndo, I can tell you you are mistaken; there's many a man would rather\nundertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling\nyou were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a\ngerfalcon; but I'm no good at dancing.\"\n\nWith these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room\nlaughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he\nmight sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.\n\nThe next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of the\nenchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends of\nhis, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball,\nwho had remained for the night with Don Antonio's wife, he locked himself\nup in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them the property\nit possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that now for\nthe first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but\nexcept Don Antonio's two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of\nthe enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them\nthey would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as\nthe rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived.\n\nThe first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in\na low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it,\n\"Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this moment\nthinking of?\"\n\nThe head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and\ndistinct voice, so as to be heard by all, \"I cannot judge of thoughts.\"\n\nAll were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that\nthere was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could\nhave answered. \"How many of us are here?\" asked Don Antonio once more;\nand it was answered him in the same way softly, \"Thou and thy wife, with\ntwo friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight called Don\nQuixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza by name.\"\n\nNow there was fresh astonishment; now everyone's hair was standing on end\nwith awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, \"This\nsuffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee to\nme, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let some\none else go and put what question he likes to it.\"\n\nAnd as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come\nforward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio's wife, and her\nquestion was, \"Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?\" and\nthe answer she got was, \"Be very modest.\"\n\n\"I question thee no further,\" said the fair querist.\n\nHer companion then came up and said, \"I should like to know, Head,\nwhether my husband loves me or not;\" the answer given to her was, \"Think\nhow he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;\" and the married lady went off\nsaying, \"That answer did not need a question; for of course the treatment\none receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is received.\"\n\nThen one of Don Antonio's two friends advanced and asked it, \"Who am I?\"\n\"Thou knowest,\" was the answer. \"That is not what I ask thee,\" said the\ngentleman, \"but to tell me if thou knowest me.\" \"Yes, I know thee, thou\nart Don Pedro Noriz,\" was the reply.\n\n\"I do not seek to know more,\" said the gentleman, \"for this is enough to\nconvince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;\" and as he retired the\nother friend came forward and asked it, \"Tell me, Head, what are the\nwishes of my eldest son?\"\n\n\"I have said already,\" was the answer, \"that I cannot judge of wishes;\nhowever, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee.\"\n\n\"That's 'what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,'\" said the\ngentleman, \"so I ask no more.\"\n\nDon Antonio's wife came up and said, \"I know not what to ask thee, Head;\nI would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of enjoyment\nof my good husband;\" and the answer she received was, \"Thou shalt, for\nhis vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of life, which by\ntheir intemperance others so often cut short.\"\n\nThen Don Quixote came forward and said, \"Tell me, thou that answerest,\nwas that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of\nMontesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho's whipping be accomplished\nwithout fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?\"\n\n\"As to the question of the cave,\" was the reply, \"there is much to be\nsaid; there is something of both in it. Sancho's whipping will proceed\nleisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due\nconsummation.\"\n\n\"I seek to know no more,\" said Don Quixote; \"let me but see Dulcinea\ndisenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I could wish\nfor has come upon me all at once.\"\n\nThe last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, \"Head, shall I by\nany chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hard\nlife of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?\" To which\nthe answer came, \"Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou returnest\nto it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to serve thou\nshalt cease to be a squire.\"\n\n\"Good, by God!\" said Sancho Panza; \"I could have told myself that; the\nprophet Perogrullo could have said no more.\"\n\n\"What answer wouldst thou have, beast?\" said Don Quixote; \"is it not\nenough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is enough,\" said Sancho; \"but I should have liked it to have\nmade itself plainer and told me more.\"\n\nThe questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with\nwhich all were filled, except Don Antonio's two friends who were in the\nsecret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to\nkeep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange\nmagical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another\nhead, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don\nAntonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish\nignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of wood\npainted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which it\nstood was of the same material, with four eagles' claws projecting from\nit to support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled a bust\nor figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was hollow\nthroughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so exactly that no\ntrace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the table was also\nhollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head, and the\nwhole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber in\nwhich the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the pedestal, table,\nthroat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin\ncarefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room below\ncorresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer,\nwith his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed\nfrom above downwards, and from below upwards, the words coming clearly\nand distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of\nDon Antonio's, a smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he\nhad been told beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would\ncome with him that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an\neasy matter for him to answer the first question at once and correctly;\nthe others he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide\nHamete adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve\ndays; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he had\nin his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of\nit, Don Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful\nsentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who\ncommanded him to break it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant\nvulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the\nhead was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering\nquestions, though more to Don Quixote's satisfaction than Sancho's.\n\nThe gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the\nhonours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his\nfolly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that\ntime, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did\nnot take place.\n\nDon Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot,\nfor he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so\nhe and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a\nwalk. Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don\nQuixote lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a\ndoor, \"Books printed here,\" at which he was vastly pleased, for until\nthen he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know what\nit was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing\nsheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here,\nrevising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great\nprinting offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were about\nthere; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on.\nHe approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was doing. The\nworkman replied, \"Senor, this gentleman here\" (pointing to a man of\nprepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) \"has translated\nan Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it up in type\nfor the press.\"\n\n\"What is the title of the book?\" asked Don Quixote; to which the author\nreplied, \"Senor, in Italian the book is called Le Bagatelle.\"\n\n\"And what does Le Bagatelle import in our Spanish?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\n\"Le Bagatelle,\" said the author, \"is as though we should say in Spanish\nLos Juguetes; but though the book is humble in name it has good solid\nmatter in it.\"\n\n\"I,\" said Don Quixote, \"have some little smattering of Italian, and I\nplume myself on singing some of Ariosto's stanzas; but tell me, senor--I\ndo not say this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity--have\nyou ever met with the word pignatta in your book?\"\n\n\"Yes, often,\" said the author.\n\n\"And how do you render that in Spanish?\"\n\n\"How should I render it,\" returned the author, \"but by olla?\"\n\n\"Body o' me,\" exclaimed Don Quixote, \"what a proficient you are in the\nItalian language! I would lay a good wager that where they say in Italian\npiace you say in Spanish place, and where they say piu you say mas, and\nyou translate su by arriba and giu by abajo.\"\n\n\"I translate them so of course,\" said the author, \"for those are their\nproper equivalents.\"\n\n\"I would venture to swear,\" said Don Quixote, \"that your worship is not\nknown in the world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits and\npraiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius thrust\naway into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to me that\ntranslation from one language into another, if it be not from the queens\nof languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at Flemish\ntapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible, they\nare full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with\nthe smoothness and brightness of the right side; and translation from\neasy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words, any more\nthan transcribing or copying out one document from another. But I do not\nmean by this to draw the inference that no credit is to be allowed for\nthe work of translating, for a man may employ himself in ways worse and\nless profitable to himself. This estimate does not include two famous\ntranslators, Doctor Cristobal de Figueroa, in his Pastor Fido, and Don\nJuan de Jauregui, in his Aminta, wherein by their felicity they leave it\nin doubt which is the translation and which the original. But tell me,\nare you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the\ncopyright to some bookseller?\"\n\n\"I print at my own risk,\" said the author, \"and I expect to make a\nthousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be of two\nthousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece.\"\n\n\"A fine calculation you are making!\" said Don Quixote; \"it is plain you\ndon't know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into one\nanother's hands. I promise you when you find yourself saddled with two\nthousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you,\nparticularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in any way\nhighly spiced.\"\n\n\"What!\" said the author, \"would your worship, then, have me give it to a\nbookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright and think he\nis doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame in the world,\nfor I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money, without\nwhich reputation is not worth a rap.\"\n\n\"God send your worship good luck,\" said Don Quixote; and he moved on to\nanother case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book with the\ntitle of \"Light of the Soul;\" noticing it he observed, \"Books like this,\nthough there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve to be\nprinted, for many are the sinners in these days, and lights unnumbered\nare needed for all that are in darkness.\"\n\nHe passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when he\nasked its title they told him it was called, \"The Second Part of the\nIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" by one of Tordesillas.\n\n\"I have heard of this book already,\" said Don Quixote, \"and verily and on\nmy conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to ashes as a\nmeddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it does to\nevery pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them the more\nnearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and true stories,\nthe truer they are the better they are;\" and so saying he walked out of\nthe printing office with a certain amount of displeasure in his looks.\nThat same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see the galleys that\nlay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as he had never\nseen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to the commandant of the\ngalleys that he intended to bring his guest, the famous Don Quixote of La\nMancha, of whom the commandant and all the citizens had already heard,\nthat afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them will be\ntold in the next chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nOF THE MISHAP THAT BEFELL SANCHO PANZA THROUGH THE VISIT TO THE GALLEYS,\nAND THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR MORISCO\n\n\nProfound were Don Quixote's reflections on the reply of the enchanted\nhead, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the trick, but\nall concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as a certainty, of\nDulcinea's disenchantment. This he turned over in his mind again and\nagain with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he would shortly see\nits fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been said, he hated\nbeing a governor, still he had a longing to be giving orders and finding\nhimself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being in authority,\neven in jest, brings with it.\n\nTo resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his two\nfriends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. The commandant\nhad been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing two such famous\npersons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they came to the shore\nall the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out. A skiff\ncovered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately\nlowered into the water, and as Don Quixote stepped on board of it, the\nleading galley fired her gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same;\nand as he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (as is\nthe custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley) by\nexclaiming \"Hu, hu, hu,\" three times. The general, for so we shall call\nhim, a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand and embraced him,\nsaying, \"I shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest\nI can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I have seen Senor Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we see contained and condensed\nall that is worthy in knight-errantry.\"\n\nDon Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception,\nreplied to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the\npoop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the\nbulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all\nhands to strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a\nnumber of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more when\nhe saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as if all\nthe devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy bread to\nwhat I am going to tell now. Sancho was seated on the captain's stage,\nclose to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side. He, previously\ninstructed in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho, hoisting him up in\nhis arms, and the whole crew, who were standing ready, beginning on the\nright, proceeded to pass him on, whirling him along from hand to hand and\nfrom bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor\nSancho's eyes, and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were\nflying away with him; nor did they leave off with him until they had sent\nhim back along the left side and deposited him on the poop; and the poor\nfellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unable to\ncomprehend what it was that had happened to him.\n\nDon Quixote when he saw Sancho's flight without wings asked the general\nif this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys for\nthe first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting them as a\nprofession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and if\nanyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to God he\nwould kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and clapped his\nhand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning and lowered\nthe yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven was coming off\nits hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of terror he ducked it\nand buried it between his knees; nor were Don Quixote's knees altogether\nunder control, for he too shook a little, squeezed his shoulders together\nand lost colour. The crew then hoisted the yard with the same rapidity\nand clatter as when they lowered it, all the while keeping silence as\nthough they had neither voice nor breath. The boatswain gave the signal\nto weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of the gangway began to lay\non to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash or whip, and to haul\nout gradually to sea.\n\nWhen Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) moving\nall together, he said to himself, \"It's these that are the real chanted\nthings, and not the ones my master talks of. What can those wretches have\ndone to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes along there\nwhistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, or at least\npurgatory!\"\n\nDon Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going on,\nsaid to him, \"Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might you\nfinish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to the\nwaist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain and\nsufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover\nperhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on\nwith a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourself\nat last.\"\n\nThe general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was\nDulcinea's disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, \"Monjui signals that\nthere is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.\"\n\nOn hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, \"Now then, my\nsons, don't let her give us the slip! It must be some Algerine corsair\nbrigantine that the watchtower signals to us.\" The three others\nimmediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders. The\ngeneral ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept in\nshore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. The crews\nplied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed to fly.\nThe two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles sighted a vessel\nwhich, so far as they could make out, they judged to be one of fourteen\nor fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the vessel discovered the\ngalleys she went about with the object and in the hope of making her\nescape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the chief galley was one\nof the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her so rapidly that they on\nboard the brigantine saw clearly there was no possibility of escaping,\nand the rais therefore would have had them drop their oars and give\nthemselves up so as not to provoke the captain in command of our galleys\nto anger. But chance, directing things otherwise, so ordered it that just\nas the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to\nhear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that\nis to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board\nthe brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers\nthat lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he\nwould not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as\nhe bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the\noars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw\ntheir case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made\nsail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their\nactivity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm,\nfor the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile\nthrew her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other two\ngalleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the\nbeach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see what\nthey brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived that the\nviceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to push off to\nfetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging\nforthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel,\nabout six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them\nTurkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and\nwas answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards proved to\nbe a Spanish renegade), \"This young man, senor that you see here is our\nrais,\" and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most gallant-looking\nyouths that could be imagined. He did not seem to be twenty years of age.\n\n\"Tell me, dog,\" said the general, \"what led thee to kill my soldiers,\nwhen thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Is that the way to\nbehave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is not valour?\nFaint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.\"\n\nThe rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that moment\nlisten to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was now\ncoming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants and\nsome of the people.\n\n\"You have had a good chase, senor general,\" said the viceroy.\n\n\"Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to this\nyard,\" replied the general.\n\n\"How so?\" returned the viceroy.\n\n\"Because,\" said the general, \"against all law, reason, and usages of war\nthey have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on board these\ngalleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken, but above\nall this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,\" and he pointed to him\nas he stood with his hands already bound and the rope round his neck,\nready for death.\n\nThe viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so graceful,\nand so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the comeliness of\nthe youth furnishing him at once with a letter of recommendation. He\ntherefore questioned him, saying, \"Tell me, rais, art thou Turk, Moor, or\nrenegade?\"\n\nTo which the youth replied, also in Spanish, \"I am neither Turk, nor\nMoor, nor renegade.\"\n\n\"What art thou, then?\" said the viceroy.\n\n\"A Christian woman,\" replied the youth.\n\n\"A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances! It\nis more marvellous than credible,\" said the viceroy.\n\n\"Suspend the execution of the sentence,\" said the youth; \"your vengeance\nwill not lose much by waiting while I tell you the story of my life.\"\n\nWhat heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at any\nrate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The\ngeneral bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his\nflagrant offence. With this permission the youth began in these words.\n\n\"Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise,\nupon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of our\nmisfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it was in\nvain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a mere\npretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It availed me\nnothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to protest this, nor\nwould my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they treated it as an\nuntruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain behind in the land\nof my birth; and so, more by force than of my own will, they took me with\nthem. I had a Christian mother, and a father who was a man of sound sense\nand a Christian too; I imbibed the Catholic faith with my mother's milk,\nI was well brought up, and neither in word nor in deed did I, I think,\nshow any sign of being a Morisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I\nhold them, my beauty, if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as\nwas the seclusion in which I lived it was not so great but that a young\ngentleman, Don Gaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is\nlord of a village near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing\nme. How he saw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not\nkept from him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I\nam in dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between\ntongue and throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to\naccompany me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes who\nwere going forth from other villages, for he knew their language very\nwell, and on the voyage he struck up a friendship with my two uncles who\nwere carrying me with them; for my father, like a wise and far-sighted\nman, as soon as he heard the first edict for our expulsion, quitted the\nvillage and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad. He left\nhidden and buried, at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a large\nquantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, together with a\nsum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on no account\nto touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled us before his\nreturn. I obeyed him, and with my uncles, as I have said, and others of\nour kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and the place where\nwe took up our abode was Algiers, much the same as if we had taken it up\nin hell itself. The king heard of my beauty, and report told him of my\nwealth, which was in some degree fortunate for me. He summoned me before\nhim, and asked me what part of Spain I came from, and what money and\njewels I had. I mentioned the place, and told him the jewels and money\nwere buried there; but that they might easily be recovered if I myself\nwent back for them. All this I told him, in dread lest my beauty and not\nhis own covetousness should influence him. While he was engaged in\nconversation with me, they brought him word that in company with me was\none of the handsomest and most graceful youths that could be imagined. I\nknew at once that they were speaking of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose\ncomeliness surpasses the most highly vaunted beauty. I was troubled when\nI thought of the danger he was in, for among those barbarous Turks a fair\nyouth is more esteemed than a woman, be she ever so beautiful. The king\nimmediately ordered him to be brought before him that he might see him,\nand asked me if what they said about the youth was true. I then, almost\nas if inspired by heaven, told him it was, but that I would have him to\nknow it was not a man, but a woman like myself, and I entreated him to\nallow me to go and dress her in the attire proper to her, so that her\nbeauty might be seen to perfection, and that she might present herself\nbefore him with less embarrassment. He bade me go by all means, and said\nthat the next day we should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return\nto Spain to carry away the hidden treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him\nthe danger he was in if he let it be seen he was a man, I dressed him as\na Moorish woman, and that same afternoon I brought him before the king,\nwho was charmed when he saw him, and resolved to keep the damsel and make\na present of her to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she might run\namong the women of his seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he commanded\nher to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rank who would\nprotect and attend to her; and thither he was taken at once. What we both\nsuffered (for I cannot deny that I love him) may be left to the\nimagination of those who are separated if they love one another dearly.\nThe king then arranged that I should return to Spain in this brigantine,\nand that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, should accompany me.\nThere also came with me this Spanish renegade\"--and here she pointed to\nhim who had first spoken--\"whom I know to be secretly a Christian, and to\nbe more desirous of being left in Spain than of returning to Barbary. The\nrest of the crew of the brigantine are Moors and Turks, who merely serve\nas rowers. The two Turks, greedy and insolent, instead of obeying the\norders we had to land me and this renegade in Christian dress (with which\nwe came provided) on the first Spanish ground we came to, chose to run\nalong the coast and make some prize if they could, fearing that if they\nput us ashore first, we might, in case of some accident befalling us,\nmake it known that the brigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened\nto be any galleys on the coast, they might be taken. We sighted this\nshore last night, and knowing nothing of these galleys, we were\ndiscovered, and the result was what you have seen. To sum up, there is\nDon Gregorio in woman's dress, among women, in imminent danger of his\nlife; and here am I, with hands bound, in expectation, or rather in\ndread, of losing my life, of which I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends\nmy sad story, as true as it is unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me\nto die like a Christian, for, as I have already said, I am not to be\ncharged with the offence of which those of my nation are guilty;\" and she\nstood silent, her eyes filled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty\nfrom the bystanders. The viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her\nwithout speaking and untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish\ngirl.\n\nBut all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story, an\nelderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same time as\nthe viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she ceased\nspeaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said in a voice\nbroken by sobs and sighs, \"O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter, I am thy\nfather Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live without thee,\nmy soul that thou art!\"\n\nAt these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head, which\nhe had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion; and\nlooking at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met the\nday he quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his\ndaughter. She being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears\nwith his, while he addressing the general and the viceroy said, \"This,\nsirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name.\nShe is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own beauty\nas for my wealth. I quitted my native land in search of some shelter or\nrefuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany I returned in this\npilgrim's dress, in the company of some other German pilgrims, to seek my\ndaughter and take up a large quantity of treasure I had left buried. My\ndaughter I did not find, the treasure I found and have with me; and now,\nin this strange roundabout way you have seen, I find the treasure that\nmore than all makes me rich, my beloved daughter. If our innocence and\nher tears and mine can with strict justice open the door to clemency,\nextend it to us, for we never had any intention of injuring you, nor do\nwe sympathise with the aims of our people, who have been justly\nbanished.\"\n\n\"I know Ricote well,\" said Sancho at this, \"and I know too that what he\nsays about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as to those other\nparticulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions, I\nsay nothing.\"\n\nWhile all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general\nsaid, \"At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live,\nfair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but these\nrash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have\ncommitted;\" and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who had\nkilled his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,\nhowever, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour\nsavoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to the\nviceroy's request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. They\nthen tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio from\nthe danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that object more\nthan two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; they proposed\nseveral plans, but none so good as that suggested by the renegade already\nmentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small vessel of about\nsix banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew where, how, and when he\ncould and should land, nor was he ignorant of the house in which Don\nGaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy had some hesitation about\nplacing confidence in the renegade and entrusting him with the Christians\nwho were to row, but Ana Felix said she could answer for him, and her\nfather offered to go and pay the ransom of the Christians if by any\nchance they should not be forthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon, the\nviceroy landed, and Don Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her\nfather home with him, the viceroy charging him to give them the best\nreception and welcome in his power, while on his own part he offered all\nthat house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-will\nand kindliness the beauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nTREATING OF THE ADVENTURE WHICH GAVE DON QUIXOTE MORE UNHAPPINESS THAN\nALL THAT HAD HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIM\n\n\nThe wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely happy\nto see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with great kindness,\ncharmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in both\nrespects the fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the\ncity flocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the ringing\nof the bells.\n\nDon Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing Don\nGregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than its\nadvantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his arms and\nhorse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the whole\nMoorish host, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.\n\n\"Remember, your worship,\" observed Sancho on hearing him say so, \"Senor\nDon Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, and took her to\nFrance by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry off Don Gregorio,\nwe have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there's the sea between.\"\n\n\"There's a remedy for everything except death,\" said Don Quixote; \"if\nthey bring the vessel close to the shore we shall be able to get on board\nthough all the world strive to prevent us.\"\n\n\"Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,\" said Sancho; \"but\n'it's a long step from saying to doing;' and I hold to the renegade, for\nhe seems to me an honest good-hearted fellow.\"\n\nDon Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, the\nexpedient of the great Don Quixote's expedition to Barbary should be\nadopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of\nsix oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys\nmade sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him know\nall about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the\nviceroy promised to do as he requested.\n\nOne morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed\nin full armour (for, as he often said, that was \"his only gear, his only\nrest the fray,\" and he never was without it for a moment), he saw coming\ntowards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon painted on\nhis shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard, said in a\nloud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, \"Illustrious knight, and\nnever sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am the Knight of\nthe White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps have recalled\nhim to thy memory. I come to do battle with thee and prove the might of\nthy arm, to the end that I make thee acknowledge and confess that my\nlady, let her be who she may, is incomparably fairer than thy Dulcinea\ndel Toboso. If thou dost acknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shalt\nescape death and save me the trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thou\nfightest and I vanquish thee, I demand no other satisfaction than that,\nlaying aside arms and abstaining from going in quest of adventures, thou\nwithdraw and betake thyself to thine own village for the space of a year,\nand live there without putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet and\nbeneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thy\nsubstance and the salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, my\nhead shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and the\nrenown of my deeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will be\nthy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the\ntime I have for the despatch of this business.\"\n\nDon Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the White\nMoon's arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, and with\ncalm dignity he answered him, \"Knight of the White Moon, of whose\nachievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swear you\nhave never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen her I know you\nwould have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because\nthe sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has\nbeen or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying you\nlie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept your\nchallenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that the\nday you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except only\nthat of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for I\nknow not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am\nsatisfied with my own, such as they be. Take, therefore, the side of the\nfield you choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it\nmay Saint Peter add his blessing.\"\n\nThe Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told\nthe viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy,\nfancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or\nsome other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach\naccompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don\nQuixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary\ndistance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were\nevidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them,\nasking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden\nin this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question\nof precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don\nQuixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides\nhad been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a\nlow voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it\nsome joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he\nneither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in\nearnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not\nknowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to\npersuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying,\n\"If there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess\nor die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon\nstill more so, in God's hand be it, and fall on.\"\n\nHe of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen\nwords for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then,\ncommending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, as\nwas his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to\ntake a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same;\nthen, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them\nthe signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and\nhe of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having\ntraversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such\nviolence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high,\nto all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the\nearth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance\nover his visor said to him, \"You are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead\nunless you admit the conditions of our defiance.\"\n\nDon Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a\nweak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, \"Dulcinea del\nToboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate\nknight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my\nfeebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since\nyou have taken away my honour.\"\n\n\"That will I not, in sooth,\" said he of the White Moon; \"live the fame of\nthe lady Dulcinea's beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is that the\ngreat Don Quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so long a\ntime as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed before engaging in\nthis combat.\"\n\nThe viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all\nthis, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in\nprejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest\nlike a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the White Moon\nwheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the\nhead, rode away into the city at a half gallop. The viceroy bade Don\nAntonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was.\nThey raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and\nbathed with sweat.\n\nRocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir\nfor the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to\nsay or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a\npiece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound not to take\nup arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his achievements\nobscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke\nbefore the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and his\nmaster's bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of his\nmadness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried him into the\ncity in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy\nhimself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon\nwas who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nWHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISE DON\nGREGORIO'S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS\n\n\nDon Antonia Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of\nboys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housed\nin a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make his\nacquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove his\narmour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don\nAntonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was. He\nof the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him,\nsaid, \"I know very well, senor, what you have come for; it is to find out\nwho I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from you,\nwhile my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the true\nstate of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know, senor,\nthat I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same village\nas Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who\nknow him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt it most;\nand persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at\nhome and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there.\nThree months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant,\nunder the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage\nhim in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the\ncondition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of\nthe victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him as\nvanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and not\nleave it for a whole year, by which time he might be cured. But fate\nordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my\nplan failed. He went his way, and I came back conquered, covered with\nshame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous\none. But this did not quench my desire to meet him again and overcome\nhim, as you have seen to-day. And as he is so scrupulous in his\nobservance of the laws of knight-errantry, he will, no doubt, in order to\nkeep his word, obey the injunction I have laid upon him. This, senor, is\nhow the matter stands, and I have nothing more to tell you. I implore of\nyou not to betray me, or tell Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest\nendeavours may be successful, and that a man of excellent wits--were he\nonly rid of the fooleries of chivalry--may get them back again.\"\n\n\"O senor,\" said Don Antonio, \"may God forgive you the wrong you have done\nthe whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it back to\nhis senses. Do you not see, senor, that the gain by Don Quixote's sanity\ncan never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? But my belief is that all\nthe senor bachelor's pains will be of no avail to bring a man so\nhopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were not uncharitable,\nI would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by his recovery we lose\nnot only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho Panza's too, any one\nof which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment. However,\nI'll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and we'll see whether I am\nright in my suspicion that Senor Carrasco's efforts will be fruitless.\"\n\nThe bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he\nhoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don\nAntonio's commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour\npacked at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on\nthe horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country without\nmeeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.\n\nDon Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the\nviceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote's\nretirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of\nhis mad doings.\n\nSix days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and\nout of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho\nstrove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, \"Hold up\nyour head, senor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to\nheaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off\nwith a broken rib; and, as you know that 'where they give they take,' and\nthat 'there are not always fletches where there are pegs,' a fig for the\ndoctor, for there's no need of him to cure this ailment. Let us go home,\nand give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and\nplaces; rightly looked at, it is I that am the greater loser, though it\nis your worship that has had the worse usage. With the government I gave\nup all wish to be a governor again, but I did not give up all longing to\nbe a count; and that will never come to pass if your worship gives up\nbecoming a king by renouncing the calling of chivalry; and so my hopes\nare going to turn into smoke.\"\n\n\"Peace, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"thou seest my suspension and\nretirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured\ncalling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county\nto bestow on thee.\"\n\n\"May God hear it and sin be deaf,\" said Sancho; \"I have always heard say\nthat 'a good hope is better than a bad holding.\"\n\nAs they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and\nexclaiming, \"Reward me for my good news, Senor Don Quixote! Don Gregorio\nand the renegade who went for him have come ashore--ashore do I say? They\nare by this time in the viceroy's house, and will be here immediately.\"\n\nDon Quixote cheered up a little and said, \"Of a truth I am almost ready\nto say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way, for\nit would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the might of\nmy arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don Gregorio, but all\nthe Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what am I saying,\nmiserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been conquered? Am I not\nhe that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must not take up arms for a\nyear? Then what am I making professions for; what am I bragging about;\nwhen it is fitter for me to handle the distaff than the sword?\"\n\n\"No more of that, senor,\" said Sancho; \"'let the hen live, even though it\nbe with her pip; 'today for thee and to-morrow for me;' in these affairs\nof encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he that falls to-day\nmay get up to-morrow; unless indeed he chooses to lie in bed, I mean\ngives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spirit for fresh\nbattles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio; for the\nhousehold seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he has come by this\ntime;\" and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and the renegade had\ngiven the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home, Don Gregorio,\neager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to Don Antonio's house.\nWhen they carried him away from Algiers he was in woman's dress; on board\nthe vessel, however, he exchanged it for that of a captive who escaped\nwith him; but in whatever dress he might be he looked like one to be\nloved and served and esteemed, for he was surpassingly well-favoured, and\nto judge by appearances some seventeen or eighteen years of age. Ricote\nand his daughter came out to welcome him, the father with tears, the\ndaughter with bashfulness. They did not embrace each other, for where\nthere is deep love there will never be overmuch boldness. Seen side by\nside, the comeliness of Don Gregorio and the beauty of Ana Felix were the\nadmiration of all who were present. It was silence that spoke for the\nlovers at that moment, and their eyes were the tongues that declared\ntheir pure and happy feelings. The renegade explained the measures and\nmeans he had adopted to rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great\nlength, but in a few words, in which he showed that his intelligence was\nin advance of his years, described the peril and embarrassment he found\nhimself in among the women with whom he had sojourned. To conclude,\nRicote liberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men\nwho had rowed; and the renegade effected his readmission into the body of\nthe Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became by\npenance and repentance a clean and sound one.\n\nTwo days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps they\nshould take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for it\nseemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so good\na Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed remaining\nthere. Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the capital, whither\nhe was compelled to go on some other business, hinting that many a\ndifficult affair was settled there with the help of favour and bribes.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, \"it will not\ndo to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great Don Bernardino\nde Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty has entrusted our\nexpulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor appeals to\ncompassion, are of any use; for though it is true he mingles mercy with\njustice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is tainted and\ncorrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather than the salve\nthat soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and the fear he\ninspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight of this great\npolicy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and plots,\nimportunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus eyes, ever\non the watch lest one of us should remain behind in concealment, and like\na hidden root come in course of time to sprout and bear poisonous fruit\nin Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the fear in which our vast\nnumbers kept it. Heroic resolve of the great Philip the Third, and\nunparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to the said Don Bernardino de\nVelasco!\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Don Antonio, \"when I am there I will make all\npossible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregorio will\ncome with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must be suffering\non account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house with my\nwife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad that the\nworthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I can make.\"\n\nThe viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on learning\nwhat had passed declared he could not and would not on any account leave\nAna Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see his parents and\ndevise some way of returning for her, he fell in with the proposed\narrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio's wife, and Ricote in\nthe viceroy's house.\n\nThe day for Don Antonio's departure came; and two days later that for Don\nQuixote's and Sancho's, for Don Quixote's fall did not suffer him to take\nthe road sooner. There were tears and sighs, swoonings and sobs, at the\nparting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. Ricote offered Don Gregorio a\nthousand crowns if he would have them, but he would not take any save\nfive which Don Antonio lent him and he promised to repay at the capital.\nSo the two of them took their departure, and Don Quixote and Sancho\nafterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixote without his armour and\nin travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapple being loaded with the\narmour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nWHICH TREATS OF WHAT HE WHO READS WILL SEE, OR WHAT HE WHO HAS IT READ TO\nHIM WILL HEAR\n\n\nAs he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he had\nfallen. \"Here Troy was,\" said he; \"here my ill-luck, not my cowardice,\nrobbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me the victim of\nher caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed; here, in a\nword, fell my happiness never to rise again.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" said Sancho on hearing this, \"it is the part of brave hearts to\nbe patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; I judge\nby myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that I am a\nsquire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that she whom\ncommonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what is\nmore, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whom she\ncasts down or whom she sets up.\"\n\n\"Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"thou speakest\nvery sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can tell thee there is\nno such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything which takes\nplace there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the special\npreordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that 'each of us is\nthe maker of his own Fortune.' I have been that of mine; but not with the\nproper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has therefore made me\npay dearly; for I ought to have reflected that Rocinante's feeble\nstrength could not resist the mighty bulk of the Knight of the White\nMoon's horse. In a word, I ventured it, I did my best, I was overthrown,\nbut though I lost my honour I did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of\nkeeping my word. When I was a knight-errant, daring and valiant, I\nsupported my achievements by hand and deed, and now that I am a humble\nsquire I will support my words by keeping the promise I have given.\nForward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keep the year of the\nnovitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion we shall pick up\nfresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten calling of arms.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" returned Sancho, \"travelling on foot is not such a pleasant\nthing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches. Let\nus leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of some one that has\nbeen hanged; and then with me on Dapple's back and my feet off the ground\nwe will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure them out;\nbut to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and make long ones, is\nto suppose nonsense.\"\n\n\"Thou sayest well, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"let my armour be hung up\nfor a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what\nwas inscribed on the trophy of Roland's armour--\n\nThese let none move\nWho dareth not his might with Roland prove.\"\n\n\"That's the very thing,\" said Sancho; \"and if it was not that we should\nfeel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him\nhung up too.\"\n\n\"And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,\" said\nDon Quixote, \"that it may not be said, 'for good service a bad return.'\"\n\n\"Your worship is right,\" said Sancho; \"for, as sensible people hold, 'the\nfault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;' and, as in this\naffair the fault is your worship's, punish yourself and don't let your\nanger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or the\nmeekness of Rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make them\ntravel more than is reasonable.\"\n\nIn converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four\nsucceeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,\nbut on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of\npeople at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.\nUpon Don Quixote's approach a peasant called out, \"One of these two\ngentlemen who come here, and who don't know the parties, will tell us\nwhat we ought to do about our wager.\"\n\n\"That I will, certainly,\" said Don Quixote, \"and according to the rights\nof the case, if I can manage to understand it.\"\n\n\"Well, here it is, worthy sir,\" said the peasant; \"a man of this village\nwho is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour\nof his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement\nwas that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal\nweights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be\nequalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put\neleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the\nthin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer;\n\"it's for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a\njudge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and\ngive an opinion in disputes of all sorts.\"\n\n\"Answer in God's name, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I am not\nfit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.\"\n\nWith this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered\nround him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his,\n\"Brothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a\nshadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the\nchallenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose such\nas will prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is\nthat the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and\ntake eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he\npleases, and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine\nstone weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of his\nopponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.\"\n\n\"By all that's good,\" said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho's\ndecision, \"but the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given judgment\nlike a canon! But I'll be bound the fat man won't part with an ounce of\nhis flesh, not to say eleven stone.\"\n\n\"The best plan will be for them not to run,\" said another, \"so that\nneither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip\nhimself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let's take\nthese gentlemen to the tavern where there's the best, and 'over me be the\ncloak when it rains.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sirs,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I cannot stop for an instant,\nfor sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous\nand to travel apace;\" and spurring Rocinante he pushed on, leaving them\nwondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own strange figure and\nat the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took Sancho to be; and\nanother of them observed, \"If the servant is so clever, what must the\nmaster be? I'll bet, if they are going to Salamanca to study, they'll\ncome to be alcaldes of the Court in a trice; for it's a mere joke--only\nto read and read, and have interest and good luck; and before a man knows\nwhere he is he finds himself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his\nhead.\"\n\nThat night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and\nthe next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards\nthem a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked\nstaff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he\ncame close to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to\nhim, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher,\nexclaimed with evident pleasure, \"O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what\nhappiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your\nworship is coming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady\nthe duchess!\"\n\n\"I do not recognise you, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"nor do I know who\nyou are, unless you tell me.\"\n\n\"I am Tosilos, my lord the duke's lacquey, Senor Don Quixote,\" replied\nthe courier; \"he who refused to fight your worship about marrying the\ndaughter of Dona Rodriguez.\"\n\n\"God bless me!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"is it possible that you are the\none whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you speak\nof in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, good sir!\" said the messenger; \"there was no enchantment or\ntransformation at all; I entered the lists just as much lacquey Tosilos\nas I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry without\nfighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a very\ndifferent result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my lord\nthe duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having acted\ncontrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat; and the\nend of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and Dona\nRodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to Barcelona\nwith a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is sending him.\nIf your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here\nfull of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a\nprovocative and wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep.\"\n\n\"I take the offer,\" said Sancho; \"no more compliments about it; pour out,\ngood Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the Indies.\"\n\n\"Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote, \"and the greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see that\nthis courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with him and\ntake thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come up with me.\"\n\nThe lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and\ntaking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the\ngreen grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents\nof the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the\nwrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese.\n\nSaid Tosilos to Sancho, \"Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master of\nthine ought to be a madman.\"\n\n\"Ought!\" said Sancho; \"he owes no man anything; he pays for everything,\nparticularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain enough, and I tell\nhim so plain enough; but what's the use? especially now that it is all\nover with him, for here he is beaten by the Knight of the White Moon.\"\n\nTosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied\nthat it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him;\nand that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that;\nand then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs\nout of his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to\nTosilos left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under\nthe shade of a tree.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nOF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A LIFE\nIN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WAS RUNNING\nITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY\n\n\nIf a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he had\nbeen overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He was\nunder the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies on\nhoney, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of them\nturned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he was\nabout to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke in\nhigh praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.\n\n\"Is it possible, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"that thou dost still think\nthat he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it has escaped thy memory\nthat thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant wench,\nand the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelor Carrasco; all the work of\nthe enchanters that persecute me. But tell me now, didst thou ask this\nTosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of Altisidora, did she weep\nover my absence, or has she already consigned to oblivion the love\nthoughts that used to afflict her when I was present?\"\n\n\"The thoughts that I had,\" said Sancho, \"were not such as to leave time\nfor asking fool's questions. Body o' me, senor! is your worship in a\ncondition now to inquire into other people's thoughts, above all love\nthoughts?\"\n\n\"Look ye, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"there is a great difference between\nwhat is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. A knight may\nvery possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible, strictly\nspeaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to all appearance, loved\nme truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou knowest of; she wept at my\ndeparture, she cursed me, she abused me, casting shame to the winds she\nbewailed herself in public; all signs that she adored me; for the wrath\nof lovers always ends in curses. I had no hopes to give her, nor\ntreasures to offer her, for mine are given to Dulcinea, and the treasures\nof knights-errant are like those of the fairies,' illusory and deceptive;\nall I can give her is the place in my memory I keep for her, without\nprejudice, however, to that which I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou\nart wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that\nflesh--would that I saw it eaten by wolves--which would rather keep\nitself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"if the truth is to be told, I cannot persuade\nmyself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the\ndisenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, 'If your head aches\nrub ointment on your knees;' at any rate I'll make bold to swear that in\nall the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has read\nyou have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether\nor no I'll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and the opportunity\nserves for scourging myself comfortably.\"\n\n\"God grant it,\" said Don Quixote; \"and heaven give thee grace to take it\nto heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who is\nthine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.\"\n\nAs they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very\nsame spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixote\nrecognised it, and said he to Sancho, \"This is the meadow where we came\nupon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to\nrevive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it was\nhappy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it, Sancho, I\nwould have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time I have to\nlive in retirement. I will buy some ewes and everything else requisite\nfor the pastoral calling; and, I under the name of the shepherd Quixotize\nand thou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam the woods and groves and\nmeadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegies there, drinking of the\ncrystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers. The\noaks will yield us their sweet fruit with bountiful hand, the trunks of\nthe hard cork trees a seat, the willows shade, the roses perfume, the\nwidespread meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes; the clear pure\nair will give us breath, the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the\nnight for us, song shall be our delight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will\nsupply us with verses, and love with conceits whereby we shall make\nourselves famed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come.\"\n\n\"Egad,\" said Sancho, \"but that sort of life squares, nay corners, with my\nnotions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrasco and Master\nNicholas the barber won't have well seen it before they'll want to follow\nit and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it may not come into\nthe curate's head to join the sheepfold too, he's so jovial and fond of\nenjoying himself.\"\n\n\"Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"and the\nbachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the pastoral fraternity, as no\ndoubt he will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino, or perhaps the\nshepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himself Niculoso, as old\nBoscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate I don't know what\nname we can fit to him unless it be something derived from his title, and\nwe call him the shepherd Curiambro. For the shepherdesses whose lovers we\nshall be, we can pick names as we would pears; and as my lady's name does\njust as well for a shepherdess's as for a princess's, I need not trouble\nmyself to look for one that will suit her better; to thine, Sancho, thou\ncanst give what name thou wilt.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to give her any but Teresona,\" said Sancho, \"which will go\nwell with her stoutness and with her own right name, as she is called\nTeresa; and then when I sing her praises in my verses I'll show how\nchaste my passion is, for I'm not going to look 'for better bread than\never came from wheat' in other men's houses. It won't do for the curate\nto have a shepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor\nchooses to have one, that is his look-out.\"\n\n\"God bless me, Sancho my friend!\" said Don Quixote, \"what a life we shall\nlead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear, what tabors,\ntimbrels, and rebecks! And then if among all these different sorts of\nmusic that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoral instruments\nwill be there.\"\n\n\"What are albogues?\" asked Sancho, \"for I never in my life heard tell of\nthem or saw them.\"\n\n\"Albogues,\" said Don Quixote, \"are brass plates like candlesticks that\nstruck against one another on the hollow side make a noise which, if not\nvery pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords very well\nwith the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue is\nMorisco, as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with al; for\nexample, almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema, almacen,\nalcancia, and others of the same sort, of which there are not many more;\nour language has only three that are Morisco and end in i, which are\nborcegui, zaquizami, and maravedi. Alheli and alfaqui are seen to be\nArabic, as well by the al at the beginning as by the i they end with. I\nmention this incidentally, the chance allusion to albogues having\nreminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance to us in the\nperfect practice of this calling that I am something of a poet, as thou\nknowest, and that besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished\none. Of the curate I say nothing; but I will wager he has some spice of\nthe poet in him, and no doubt Master Nicholas too, for all barbers, or\nmost of them, are guitar players and stringers of verses. I will bewail\nmy separation; thou shalt glorify thyself as a constant lover; the\nshepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejected one, and the curate\nCuriambro as whatever may please him best; and so all will go as gaily as\nheart could wish.\"\n\nTo this Sancho made answer, \"I am so unlucky, senor, that I'm afraid the\nday will never come when I'll see myself at such a calling. O what neat\nspoons I'll make when I'm a shepherd! What messes, creams, garlands,\npastoral odds and ends! And if they don't get me a name for wisdom,\nthey'll not fail to get me one for ingenuity. My daughter Sanchica will\nbring us our dinner to the pasture. But stay-she's good-looking, and\nshepherds there are with more mischief than simplicity in them; I would\nnot have her 'come for wool and go back shorn;' love-making and lawless\ndesires are just as common in the fields as in the cities, and in\nshepherds' shanties as in royal palaces; 'do away with the cause, you do\naway with the sin;' 'if eyes don't see hearts don't break' and 'better a\nclear escape than good men's prayers.'\"\n\n\"A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"any one of\nthose thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thy meaning; many a time\nhave I recommended thee not to be so lavish with proverbs and to exercise\nsome moderation in delivering them; but it seems to me it is only\n'preaching in the desert;' 'my mother beats me and I go on with my\ntricks.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship is like the common\nsaying, 'Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Get away, blackbreech.' You\nchide me for uttering proverbs, and you string them in couples yourself.\"\n\n\"Observe, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I bring in proverbs to the\npurpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to the finger; thou\nbringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a way that thou dost\ndrag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am not mistaken, I have\ntold thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawn from the\nexperience and observation of our wise men of old; but the proverb that\nis not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim. But enough\nof this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some little distance\nfrom the high road to pass the night; what is in store for us to-morrow\nGod knoweth.\"\n\nThey turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much against Sancho's\nwill, who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant upon\nknight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plenty\npresented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda's, at\nthe wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno's; he\nreflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night;\nand so that night he passed in sleeping, and his master in waking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nOF THE BRISTLY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE\n\n\nThe night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky it\nwas not in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the lady\nDiana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all\nblack and the valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as to\nsleep his first sleep, but did not give way to the second, very different\nfrom Sancho, who never had any second, because with him sleep lasted from\nnight till morning, wherein he showed what a sound constitution and few\ncares he had. Don Quixote's cares kept him restless, so much so that he\nawoke Sancho and said to him, \"I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of\nthy temperament. I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass,\nincapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. I lie awake while thou\nsleepest, I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while thou\nart sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. It is the duty of good\nservants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters,\nif it be only for the sake of appearances. See the calmness of the night,\nthe solitude of the spot, inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of\nsome sort. Rise as thou livest, and retire a little distance, and with a\ngood heart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes\non account of Dulcinea's disenchantment score; and this I entreat of\nthee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with\nthee a second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou\nhast laid them on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my\nseparation, thou thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the\npastoral life we are to follow at our village.\"\n\n\"Senor,\" replied Sancho, \"I'm no monk to get up out of the middle of my\nsleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from\none extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will your\nworship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you'll\nmake me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say my flesh.\"\n\n\"O hard heart!\" said Don Quixote, \"O pitiless squire! O bread\nill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have done thee\nand those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself a\ngovernor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of\nbeing a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I-post\ntenebras spero lucem.\"\n\n\"I don't know what that is,\" said Sancho; \"all I know is that so long as\nI am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; and good\nluck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak that covers over all a\nman's thoughts, the food that removes hunger, the drink that drives away\nthirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that tempers the heat,\nand, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewith everything is bought,\nthe weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal with the king and\nthe fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, has only one fault,\nthat it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a dead man there is\nvery little difference.\"\n\n\"Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"and here I begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost\nsometimes quote, 'Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art\nfed.'\"\n\n\"Ha, by my life, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"it's not I that am stringing\nproverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship's mouth faster\nthan from mine; only there is this difference between mine and yours,\nthat yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow, they are all\nproverbs.\"\n\nAt this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed\nto spread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laid\nhis hand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and\nput the bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass's pack-saddle on\nthe other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote's perturbation.\nEach instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified\nmen, or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage is known to\nall. The fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six\nhundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that\nhour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and\nblowing, that they deafened the ears of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and\nthey could not make out what it was. The wide-spread grunting drove came\non in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for Don Quixote's\ndignity or Sancho's, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing\nSancho's entrenchments, and not only upsetting Don Quixote but sweeping\nRocinante off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and\nthe grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,\narmour, Dapple and Rocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho\nand Don Quixote at their wits' end.\n\nSancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his\nsword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly\npigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.\n\n\"Let them be, my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"this insult is the penalty\nof my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals\nshould devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and pigs trample\nhim under foot.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,\" said Sancho, \"that\nflies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eat them,\nand hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons of the knights we\nserve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder if the penalty\nof their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourth generation. But what\nhave the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well, well, let's lie down again\nand sleep out what little of the night there's left, and God will send us\ndawn and we shall be all right.\"\n\n\"Sleep thou, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for thou wast born to sleep\nas I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawn I will\ngive a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a little\nmadrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head last night.\"\n\n\"I should think,\" said Sancho, \"that the thoughts that allow one to make\nverses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string verses as\nmuch as you like and I'll sleep as much as I can;\" and forthwith, taking\nthe space of ground he required, he muffled himself up and fell into a\nsound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble of any sort. Don\nQuixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork tree--for Cide\nHamete does not specify what kind of tree it was--sang in this strain to\nthe accompaniment of his own sighs:\n\n  When in my mind\nI muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,\n  To death I flee,\nIn hope therein the end of all to find.\n\n  But drawing near\nThat welcome haven in my sea of woe,\n  Such joy I know,\nThat life revives, and still I linger here.\n\n  Thus life doth slay,\nAnd death again to life restoreth me;\n  Strange destiny,\nThat deals with life and death as with a play!\n\nHe accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just like\none whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separation\nfrom Dulcinea.\n\nAnd now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his\nbeams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazy\nlimbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed\nthe drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their journey, and as\nevening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback\nand four or five on foot. Don Quixote's heart beat quick and Sancho's\nquailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and\nbucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho\nand said, \"If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied\nmy hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes and\nfancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we\napprehend.\" The men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances\nsurrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and\nbreast, menacing him with death. One of those on foot, putting his finger\nto his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante's bridle and\ndrew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple before\nthem, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the\none who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times attempted to ask\nwhere they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he\nbegan to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of\ntheir lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed\nabout to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple\nlikewise, as if he too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their\npace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they\nheard themselves assailed with--\"Get on, ye Troglodytes;\" \"Silence, ye\nbarbarians;\" \"March, ye cannibals;\" \"No murmuring, ye Scythians;\" \"Don't\nopen your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,\" and\nsuchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched\nmaster and man. Sancho went along saying to himself, \"We, tortolites,\nbarbers, animals! I don't like those names at all; 'it's in a bad wind\nour corn is being winnowed;' 'misfortune comes upon us all at once like\nsticks on a dog,' and God grant it may be no worse than them that this\nunlucky adventure has in store for us.\"\n\nDon Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to\nmake out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called\nthem, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no\ngood to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about an hour\nafter midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was\nthe duke's, where they had been but a short time before. \"God bless me!\"\nsaid he, as he recognised the mansion, \"what does this mean? It is all\ncourtesy and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns\ninto evil, and evil into worse.\"\n\nThey entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and\nfitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their\nfears, as will be seen in the following chapter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nOF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE\nIN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORY\n\n\nThe horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a\nmoment's delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried them\ninto the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets\nwere burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors, so that\nin spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of daylight\ncould not be perceived. In the middle of the court was a catafalque,\nraised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an\nimmense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white wax\ntapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks. Upon the\ncatafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her\nbeauty she made death itself look beautiful. She lay with her head\nresting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of\nsweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom,\nand between them a branch of yellow palm of victory. On one side of the\ncourt was erected a stage, where upon two chairs were seated two persons\nwho from having crowns on their heads and sceptres in their hands\nappeared to be kings of some sort, whether real or mock ones. By the side\nof this stage, which was reached by steps, were two other chairs on which\nthe men carrying the prisoners seated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in\nsilence, and by signs giving them to understand that they too were to be\nsilent; which, however, they would have been without any signs, for their\namazement at all they saw held them tongue-tied. And now two persons of\ndistinction, who were at once recognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the\nduke and duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and\nseated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they\nseemed to be. Who would not have been amazed at this? Nor was this all,\nfor Don Quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was\nthat of the fair Altisidora. As the duke and duchess mounted the stage\nDon Quixote and Sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which\nthey returned by bowing their heads slightly. At this moment an official\ncrossed over, and approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black\nbuckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put\nupon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy\nOffice wear; and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or\nthey would put a gag upon him, or take his life. Sancho surveyed himself\nfrom head to foot and saw himself all ablaze with flames; but as they did\nnot burn him, he did not care two farthings for them. He took off the\nmitre, and seeing it painted with devils he put it on again, saying to\nhimself, \"Well, so far those don't burn me nor do these carry me off.\"\nDon Quixote surveyed him too, and though fear had got the better of his\nfaculties, he could not help smiling to see the figure Sancho presented.\nAnd now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low\nsweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there\nsilence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing effect. Then,\nbeside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a\nfair youth in a Roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he\nhimself played, sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:\n\nWhile fair Altisidora, who the sport\n  Of cold Don Quixote's cruelty hath been,\nReturns to life, and in this magic court\n  The dames in sables come to grace the scene,\nAnd while her matrons all in seemly sort\n  My lady robes in baize and bombazine,\nHer beauty and her sorrows will I sing\nWith defter quill than touched the Thracian string.\n\nBut not in life alone, methinks, to me\n  Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongue\nIs cold in death, believe me, unto thee\n  My voice shall raise its tributary song.\nMy soul, from this strait prison-house set free,\n  As o'er the Stygian lake it floats along,\nThy praises singing still shall hold its way,\nAnd make the waters of oblivion stay.\n\nAt this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, \"Enough,\nenough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us now\nthe death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as the\nignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the\npenance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her\nto the long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest\nin judgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all that\nthe inscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this\ndamsel, announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we look\nforward to from her restoration be no longer deferred.\"\n\nNo sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, than\nRhadamanthus rising up said:\n\n\"Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, make haste\nhither one and all, and print on Sancho's face four-and-twenty smacks,\nand give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back and arms; for\nupon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.\"\n\nOn hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, \"By all that's good,\nI'll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Body o' me!\nWhat has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of this damsel?\n'The old woman took kindly to the blits; they enchant Dulcinea, and whip\nme in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of ailments God was\npleased to send her, and to bring her to life again they must give me\nfour-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and raise\nweals on my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on a brother-in-law; 'I'm\nan old dog, and \"tus, tus\" is no use with me.'\"\n\n\"Thou shalt die,\" said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; \"relent, thou tiger;\nhumble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and be silent, for no\nimpossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into the\ndifficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou shalt see\nthyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I say,\nofficials, obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye shall see\nwhat ye were born for.\"\n\nAt this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made their\nappearance in procession, one after the other, four of them with\nspectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four fingers\nof wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion now-a-days.\nNo sooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, he\nexclaimed, \"I might let myself be handled by all the world; but allow\nduennas to touch me--not a bit of it! Scratch my face, as my master was\nserved in this very castle; run me through the body with burnished\ndaggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I'll bear all in patience to\nserve these gentlefolk; but I won't let duennas touch me, though the\ndevil should carry me off!\"\n\nHere Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, \"Have patience,\nmy son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks to heaven\nthat it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by its sufferings\nthou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life the dead.\"\n\nThe duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become more\ntractable and reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented\nhis face and beard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly\nlaid on, and then made him a low curtsey.\n\n\"Less politeness and less paint, senora duenna,\" said Sancho; \"by God\nyour hands smell of vinegar-wash.\"\n\nIn fine, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household\npinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins;\nand so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and\nseizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the\nwhole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, \"Begone, ye ministers of hell;\nI'm not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures.\"\n\nAt this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long\nlying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried\nout almost with one voice, \"Altisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!\"\n\nRhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in\nview was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on\nhis knees to Sancho saying to him, \"Now is the time, son of my bowels,\nnot to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes\nthou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, I say,\nis the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with\nefficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.\"\n\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"That's trick upon trick, I think, and not\nhoney upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now,\non the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! You had better take a\nbig stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I should\nnot mind it much, if I'm to be always made the cow of the wedding for the\ncure of other people's ailments. Leave me alone; or else by God I'll\nfling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may.\"\n\nAltisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so\nthe clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all\npresent exclaiming, \"Long life to Altisidora! long life to Altisidora!\"\nThe duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, and\nall, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her and\ntake her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were\nrecovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to\nthe kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, \"God forgive\nthee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been, to me it\nseems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to thee, the\nmost compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I am now in\npossession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as thine six\nsmocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many shirts for\nthyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any rate they are all\nclean.\"\n\nSancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his\nhand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap and\ndoublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to let them\nleave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a token\nand memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said they must\nleave them with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she\nwas. The duke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that\nall should retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho\nshould be conducted to their old quarters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\nWHICH FOLLOWS SIXTY-NINE AND DEALS WITH MATTERS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE\nCLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORY\n\n\nSancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote, a\nthing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very well that\nwith questions and answers his master would not let him sleep, and he was\nin no humour for talking much, as he still felt the pain of his late\nmartyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and it would have\nbeen more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in that luxurious\nchamber in company. And so well founded did his apprehension prove, and\nso correct was his anticipation, that scarcely had his master got into\nbed when he said, \"What dost thou think of tonight's adventure, Sancho?\nGreat and mighty is the power of cold-hearted scorn, for thou with thine\nown eyes hast seen Altisidora slain, not by arrows, nor by the sword, nor\nby any warlike weapon, nor by deadly poisons, but by the thought of the\nsternness and scorn with which I have always treated her.\"\n\n\"She might have died and welcome,\" said Sancho, \"when she pleased and how\nshe pleased; and she might have left me alone, for I never made her fall\nin love or scorned her. I don't know nor can I imagine how the recovery\nof Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise, can have, as I have said\nbefore, anything to do with the sufferings of Sancho Panza. Now I begin\nto see plainly and clearly that there are enchanters and enchanted people\nin the world; and may God deliver me from them, since I can't deliver\nmyself; and so I beg of your worship to let me sleep and not ask me any\nmore questions, unless you want me to throw myself out of the window.\"\n\n\"Sleep, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"if the pinprodding and\npinches thou hast received and the smacks administered to thee will let\nthee.\"\n\n\"No pain came up to the insult of the smacks,\" said Sancho, \"for the\nsimple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gave them to me;\nbut once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, for sleep is relief\nfrom misery to those who are miserable when awake.\"\n\n\"Be it so, and God be with thee,\" said Don Quixote.\n\nThey fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of this great\nhistory, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was that\ninduced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has been\ndescribed. The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he says, not forgetting how he\nas the Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by Don\nQuixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans, resolved to try\nhis hand again, hoping for better luck than he had before; and so, having\nlearned where Don Quixote was from the page who brought the letter and\npresent to Sancho's wife, Teresa Panza, he got himself new armour and\nanother horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry his\narms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by Tom Cecial his former squire\nfor fear he should be recognised by Sancho or Don Quixote. He came to the\nduke's castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don\nQuixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at\nSaragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and\nof the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of\nSancho's backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho\nhad played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was\nenchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his\nwife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived,\ninasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed\nnot a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of\nSancho as at the length to which Don Quixote's madness went. The duke\nbegged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return\nthat way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out\nin quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on,\nand how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke's castle\nand told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don\nQuixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his\npromise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the\nbachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the\nobject that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing\nfor a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman. And so\nhe took his leave of the duke, and went home to his village to wait there\nfor Don Quixote, who was coming after him. Thereupon the duke seized the\nopportunity of practising this mystification upon him; so much did he\nenjoy everything connected with Sancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads\nabout the castle far and near, everywhere he thought Don Quixote was\nlikely to pass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants\non foot and on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair\nmeans or foul, if they met him. They did meet him, and sent word to the\nduke, who, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he\nheard of his arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be\nlit and Altisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and\nceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so well arranged\nand acted that it differed but little from reality. And Cide Hamete says,\nmoreover, that for his part he considers the concocters of the joke as\ncrazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchess were not two\nfingers' breadth removed from being something like fools themselves when\nthey took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.\n\nAs for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awake\noccupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them bringing\nwith it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a delight to Don\nQuixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come back from death to life\nas Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of her lord and lady,\nentered the chamber, crowned with the garland she had worn on the\ncatafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers,\nher hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of\nfine black ebony. Don Quixote, disconcerted and in confusion at her\nappearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether\nwith the sheets and counterpane of the bed, tongue-tied, and unable to\noffer her any civility. Altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head\nof the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said to him in a feeble, soft voice,\n\"When women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot, and\ngive a loose to the tongue that breaks through every impediment,\npublishing abroad the inmost secrets of their hearts, they are reduced to\nsore extremities. Such a one am I, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha,\ncrushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yet patient under suffering and\nvirtuous, and so much so that my heart broke with grief and I lost my\nlife. For the last two days I have been dead, slain by the thought of the\ncruelty with which thou hast treated me, obdurate knight,\n\nO harder thou than marble to my plaint;\n\nor at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not been\nthat Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings of\nthis good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.\"\n\n\"Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass, and\nI should have been obliged to him,\" said Sancho. \"But tell me,\nsenora--and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master-what did\nyou see in the other world? What goes on in hell? For of course that's\nwhere one who dies in despair is bound for.\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" said Altisidora, \"I cannot have died outright,\nfor I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is very certain I should\nnever have come out again, do what I might. The truth is, I came to the\ngate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all in\nbreeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemish\nbonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with\nfour fingers' breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look\nlonger; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me\nstill more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served\nthem for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however, did\nnot astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players it is\nusual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in that game\nall were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing one another.\"\n\"That's no wonder,\" said Sancho; \"for devils, whether playing or not, can\nnever be content, win or lose.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Altisidora; \"but there is another thing that\nsurprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball\noutlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was\nwonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. To one\nof them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that they\nknocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. 'Look what\nbook that is,' said one devil to another, and the other replied, 'It is\nthe \"Second Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" not by Cide\nHamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by his own account\nis of Tordesillas.' 'Out of this with it,' said the first, 'and into the\ndepths of hell with it out of my sight.' 'Is it so bad?' said the other.\n'So bad is it,' said the first, 'that if I had set myself deliberately to\nmake a worse, I could not have done it.' They then went on with their\ngame, knocking other books about; and I, having heard them mention the\nname of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so, took care to retain this\nvision in my memory.\"\n\n\"A vision it must have been, no doubt,\" said Don Quixote, \"for there is\nno other I in the world; this history has been going about here for some\ntime from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for everybody\ngives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by hearing that I am\nwandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or in the\ndaylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of. If it should\nbe good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but if it should\nbe bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very long journey.\"\n\nAltisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote,\nwhen he said to her, \"I have several times told you, senora that it\ngrieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they\ncan only receive gratitude, but no return. I was born to belong to\nDulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to\nher; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies\nin my heart is to suppose an impossibility. This frank declaration should\nsuffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, for no one\ncan bind himself to do impossibilities.\"\n\nHearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed,\n\"God's life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date, more\nobstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his mind\nmade up, if I fall upon you I'll tear your eyes out! Do you fancy, Don\nVanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake? All that you have\nseen to-night has been make-believe; I'm not the woman to let the black\nof my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" said Sancho; \"for all that about lovers pining\nto death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing it-Judas may\nbelieve that!\"\n\nWhile they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung the\ntwo stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to Don\nQuixote said, \"Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me in the\nnumber of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a great\nadmirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your\nachievements?\" \"Will your worship tell me who you are,\" replied Don\nQuixote, \"so that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?\" The\nyoung man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night\nbefore. \"Of a truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"your worship has a most\nexcellent voice; but what you sang did not seem to me very much to the\npurpose; for what have Garcilasso's stanzas to do with the death of this\nlady?\"\n\n\"Don't be surprised at that,\" returned the musician; \"for with the callow\npoets of our day the way is for every one to write as he pleases and\npilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane to the matter or not, and\nnow-a-days there is no piece of silliness they can sing or write that is\nnot set down to poetic licence.\"\n\nDon Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and\nduchess, who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long and\ndelightful conversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many droll\nand saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at\nhis simplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged their permission\nto take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight\nlike himself it was fitter he should live in a pig-sty than in a royal\npalace. They gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him if\nAltisidora was in his good graces.\n\nHe replied, \"Senora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel's ailment\ncomes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and constant\nemployment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell; and as she\nmust know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands; for when she\nis occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image or images of\nwhat she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts; this is the\ntruth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.\"\n\n\"And mine,\" added Sancho; \"for I never in all my life saw a lace-maker\nthat died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set on\nfinishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. I speak from my\nown experience; for when I'm digging I never think of my old woman; I\nmean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my own eyelids.\" \"You say\nwell, Sancho,\" said the duchess, \"and I will take care that my Altisidora\nemploys herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for she is\nextremely expert at it.\" \"There is no occasion to have recourse to that\nremedy, senora,\" said Altisidora; \"for the mere thought of the cruelty\nwith which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot him\nout of my memory without any other device; with your highness's leave I\nwill retire, not to have before my eyes, I won't say his rueful\ncountenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.\" \"That reminds me of the\ncommon saying, that 'he that rails is ready to forgive,'\" said the duke.\n\nAltisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,\nmade an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.\n\n\"Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,\" said Sancho, \"ill luck betide thee!\nThou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as hard as\noak; had it been me, i'faith 'another cock would have crowed to thee.'\"\n\nSo the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself and\ndined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nOF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TO\nTHEIR VILLAGE\n\n\nThe vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in one\nrespect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his defeat, and\nhis satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in Sancho, as\nhad been proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it was with\ndifficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten damsel had\nbeen really dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful, for it grieved\nhim that Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving him the smocks;\nand turning this over in his mind he said to his master, \"Surely, senor,\nI'm the most unlucky doctor in the world; there's many a physician that,\nafter killing the sick man he had to cure, requires to be paid for his\nwork, though it is only signing a bit of a list of medicines, that the\napothecary and not he makes up, and, there, his labour is over; but with\nme though to cure somebody else costs me drops of blood, smacks, pinches,\npinproddings, and whippings, nobody gives me a farthing. Well, I swear by\nall that's good if they put another patient into my hands, they'll have\nto grease them for me before I cure him; for, as they say, 'it's by his\nsinging the abbot gets his dinner,' and I'm not going to believe that\nheaven has bestowed upon me the virtue I have, that I should be dealing\nit out to others all for nothing.\"\n\n\"Thou art right, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"and Altisidora has\nbehaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; and\nalthough that virtue of thine is gratis data--as it has cost thee no\nstudy whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may\nbe--I can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the lashes\non account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I would have given it to thee\nfreely ere this. I am not sure, however, whether payment will comport\nwith the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere with the\nmedicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; consider how\nmuch thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and pay thyself\ndown with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.\"\n\nAt this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm's breadth\nwide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and\nsaid he to his master, \"Very well then, senor, I'll hold myself in\nreadiness to gratify your worship's wishes if I'm to profit by it; for\nthe love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. Let your\nworship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.\"\n\n\"If Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I were to requite thee as the\nimportance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice, the\nmines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See what thou hast of\nmine, and put a price on each lash.\"\n\n\"Of them,\" said Sancho, \"there are three thousand three hundred and odd;\nof these I have given myself five, the rest remain; let the five go for\nthe odd ones, and let us take the three thousand three hundred, which at\na quarter real apiece (for I will not take less though the whole world\nshould bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarter reals; the three\nthousand are one thousand five hundred half reals, which make seven\nhundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a hundred and fifty\nhalf reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which added to the seven\nhundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five reals in all. These\nI will stop out of what I have belonging to your worship, and I'll return\nhome rich and content, though well whipped, for 'there's no taking\ntrout'--but I say no more.\"\n\n\"O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!\" said Don Quixote; \"how we shall be\nbound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives that\nheaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be\nbut that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my\ndefeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou begin\nthe scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee a\nhundred reals over and above.\"\n\n\"When?\" said Sancho; \"this night without fail. Let your worship order it\nso that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I'll scarify\nmyself.\"\n\nNight, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world,\ncame at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of Apollo's car had\nbroken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual,\njust as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their\ndesires agree with time. They made their way at length in among some\npleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there\nvacating Rocinante's saddle and Dapple's pack-saddle, they stretched\nthemselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho's stores,\nand he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple's halter and\nheadstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech\ntrees. Don Quixote seeing him march off with such resolution and spirit,\nsaid to him, \"Take care, my friend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow\nthe lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in so great a hurry as\nto run thyself out of breath midway; I mean, do not lay on so strenuously\nas to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reached the desired\nnumber; and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much or too little, I\nwill station myself apart and count on my rosary here the lashes thou\ngivest thyself. May heaven help thee as thy good intention deserves.\"\n\n\"'Pledges don't distress a good payer,'\" said Sancho; \"I mean to lay on\nin such a way as without killing myself to hurt myself, for in that, no\ndoubt, lies the essence of this miracle.\"\n\nHe then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the\nrope he began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He might\nhave given himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no\ntrifle, and its price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he\ntold his master that he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for\neach of those lashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real\ninstead of a quarter.\n\n\"Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,\" said Don Quixote;\n\"for I double the stakes as to price.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho, \"in God's hand be it, and let it rain\nlashes.\" But the rogue no longer laid them on his shoulders, but laid on\nto the trees, with such groans every now and then, that one would have\nthought at each of them his soul was being plucked up by the roots. Don\nQuixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might make an end of\nhimself, and that through Sancho's imprudence he might miss his own\nobject, said to him, \"As thou livest, my friend, let the matter rest\nwhere it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one, and it will be\nwell to have patience; 'Zamora was not won in an hour.' If I have not\nreckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over a thousand lashes; that is\nenough for the present; 'for the ass,' to put it in homely phrase, 'bears\nthe load, but not the overload.'\"\n\n\"No, no, senor,\" replied Sancho; \"it shall never be said of me, 'The\nmoney paid, the arms broken;' go back a little further, your worship, and\nlet me give myself at any rate a thousand lashes more; for in a couple of\nbouts like this we shall have finished off the lot, and there will be\neven cloth to spare.\"\n\n\"As thou art in such a willing mood,\" said Don Quixote, \"may heaven aid\nthee; lay on and I'll retire.\"\n\nSancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had the\nbark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which he\nwhipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beech a\ntremendous lash, he cried out, \"Here dies Samson, and all with him!\"\n\nAt the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash, Don\nQuixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter that served\nhim for a courbash, said to him, \"Heaven forbid, Sancho my friend, that\nto please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is needed for the support\nof thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for a better opportunity, and\nI will content myself with a hope soon to be realised, and have patience\nuntil thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business\nto the satisfaction of everybody.\"\n\n\"As your worship will have it so, senor,\" said Sancho, \"so be it; but\nthrow your cloak over my shoulders, for I'm sweating and I don't want to\ntake cold; it's a risk that novice disciplinants run.\"\n\nDon Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who slept until\nthe sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for the time\nbeing they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues farther\non. They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognised as such\nand did not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis, and\ndrawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked more\nrationally about everything, as will be shown presently. They quartered\nhim in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangings\nthere were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in villages.\nOn one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape of Helen, when\nthe bold guest carried her off from Menelaus, and on the other was the\nstory of Dido and AEneas, she on a high tower, as though she were making\nsignals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was out at sea flying\nin a frigate or brigantine. He noticed in the two stories that Helen did\nnot go very reluctantly, for she was laughing slyly and roguishly; but\nthe fair Dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes.\nDon Quixote as he looked at them observed, \"Those two ladies were very\nunfortunate not to have been born in this age, and I unfortunate above\nall men not to have been born in theirs. Had I fallen in with those\ngentlemen, Troy would not have been burned or Carthage destroyed, for it\nwould have been only for me to slay Paris, and all these misfortunes\nwould have been avoided.\"\n\n\"I'll lay a bet,\" said Sancho, \"that before long there won't be a tavern,\nroadside inn, hostelry, or barber's shop where the story of our doings\nwon't be painted up; but I'd like it painted by the hand of a better\npainter than painted these.\"\n\n\"Thou art right, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for this painter is like\nOrbaneja, a painter there was at Ubeda, who when they asked him what he\nwas painting, used to say, 'Whatever it may turn out; and if he chanced\nto paint a cock he would write under it, 'This is a cock,' for fear they\nmight think it was a fox. The painter or writer, for it's all the same,\nwho published the history of this new Don Quixote that has come out, must\nhave been one of this sort I think, Sancho, for he painted or wrote\n'whatever it might turn out;' or perhaps he is like a poet called Mauleon\nthat was about the Court some years ago, who used to answer at haphazard\nwhatever he was asked, and on one asking him what Deum de Deo meant, he\nreplied De donde diere. But, putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast\nthou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou\nrather have it indoors or in the open air?\"\n\n\"Egad, senor,\" said Sancho, \"for what I'm going to give myself, it comes\nall the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields; still I'd\nlike it to be among trees; for I think they are company for me and help\nme to bear my pain wonderfully.\"\n\n\"And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, to\nenable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village; for\nat the latest we shall get there the day after tomorrow.\"\n\nSancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he would\nlike to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while\nhe had an appetite, because \"in delay there is apt to be danger\" very\noften, and \"praying to God and plying the hammer,\" and \"one take was\nbetter than two I'll give thee's,\" and \"a sparrow in the hand than a\nvulture on the wing.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!\" exclaimed Don Quixote; \"it\nseems to me thou art becoming sicut erat again; speak in a plain, simple,\nstraight-forward way, as I have often told thee, and thou wilt find the\ngood of it.\"\n\n\"I don't know what bad luck it is of mine,\" said Sancho, \"but I can't\nutter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my\nmind; however, I mean to mend if I can;\" and so for the present the\nconversation ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nOF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE\n\n\nAll that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn\nwaiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the\nopen country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the\naccomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a\ntraveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to\nhim who appeared to be the master, \"Here, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, your\nworship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.\"\n\nWhen he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, \"Look here, Sancho; on\nturning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I\nthink I came casually upon this name of Don Alvaro Tarfe.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Sancho; \"we had better let him dismount, and\nby-and-by we can ask about it.\"\n\nThe gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground\nfloor opposite Don Quixote's and adorned with painted serge hangings of\nthe same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and\ncoming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool,\naddressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked, \"In\nwhat direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?\"\n\n\"To a village near this which is my own village,\" replied Don Quixote;\n\"and your worship, where are you bound for?\"\n\n\"I am going to Granada, senor,\" said the gentleman, \"to my own country.\"\n\n\"And a goodly country,\" said Don Quixote; \"but will your worship do me\nthe favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more\nimportance to me to know it than I can tell you.\"\n\n\"My name is Don Alvaro Tarfe,\" replied the traveller.\n\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \"I have no doubt whatever that your\nworship is that Don Alvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part\nof the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published\nby a new author.\"\n\n\"I am the same,\" replied the gentleman; \"and that same Don Quixote, the\nprincipal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine,\nand it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced him to come\nto some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was going\nmyself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from having\nhis shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme\nrashness.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Senor Don Alvaro,\" said Don Quixote, \"am I at all like that Don\nQuixote you talk of?\"\n\n\"No indeed,\" replied the traveller, \"not a bit.\"\n\n\"And that Don Quixote-\" said our one, \"had he with him a squire called\nSancho Panza?\"\n\n\"He had,\" said Don Alvaro; \"but though he had the name of being very\ndroll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.\"\n\n\"That I can well believe,\" said Sancho at this, \"for to come out with\ndrolleries is not in everybody's line; and that Sancho your worship\nspeaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and\nthief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more\ndrolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come along\nwith me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every\nturn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don't know what I\nam saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the real Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover, the righter\nof wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector of widows,\nthe killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the peerless\nDulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all other\nDon Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.\"\n\n\"By God I believe it,\" said Don Alvaro; \"for you have uttered more\ndrolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other\nSancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a few. He\nwas more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I am\nconvinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have\nbeen trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don't know\nwhat to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa del\nNuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very\ndifferent one from mine.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I am good,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I can safely say\nI am not 'the Bad;' and to prove it, let me tell you, Senor Don Alvaro\nTarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa; so far from that, when\nit was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had been present at the\njousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order to drag his\nfalsehood before the face of the world; and so I went on straight to\nBarcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of strangers, asylum of\nthe poor, home of the valiant, champion of the wronged, pleasant exchange\nof firm friendships, and city unrivalled in site and beauty. And though\nthe adventures that befell me there are not by any means matters of\nenjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not regret them, simply because I\nhave seen it. In a word, Senor Don Alvaro Tarfe, I am Don Quixote of La\nMancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not the unlucky one that has\nattempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in my ideas. I entreat\nyour worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so good as to make a\ndeclaration before the alcalde of this village that you never in all your\nlife saw me until now, and that neither am I the Don Quixote in print in\nthe Second Part, nor this Sancho Panza, my squire, the one your worship\nknew.\"\n\n\"That I will do most willingly,\" replied Don Alvaro; \"though it amazes me\nto find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, as much alike in\nname as they differ in demeanour; and again I say and declare that what I\nsaw I cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannot have happened.\"\n\n\"No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,\"\nsaid Sancho; \"and would to heaven your disenchantment rested on my giving\nmyself another three thousand and odd lashes like what I'm giving myself\nfor her, for I'd lay them on without looking for anything.\"\n\n\"I don't understand that about the lashes,\" said Don Alvaro. Sancho\nreplied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if they\nhappened to be going the same road.\n\nBy this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Alvaro dined\ntogether. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together\nwith a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that\nit was requisite for his rights that Don Alvaro Tarfe, the gentleman\nthere present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one\nthat was in print in a history entitled \"Second Part of Don Quixote of La\nMancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\" The alcalde finally put it in\nlegal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities\nrequired in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high\ndelight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to\nthem, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference\nbetween the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities and\noffers of service were exchanged by Don Alvaro and Don Quixote, in the\ncourse of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he\ndisabused Don Alvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt\nconvinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in\ncontact with two such opposite Don Quixotes.\n\nEvening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a\nleague two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote's village, the\nother the road Don Alvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don\nQuixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea's enchantment\nand the remedy, all which threw Don Alvaro into fresh amazement, and\nembracing Don Quixote and Sancho he went his way, and Don Quixote went\nhis. That night he passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an\nopportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion\nas the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much\nmore than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes\nwould not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The duped Don\nQuixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found that\ntogether with those of the night before they made up three thousand and\ntwenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the\nsacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the\ndeception practised on Don Alvaro, and saying how well done it was to\nhave taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable\nform. That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth\nmention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho\nfinished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He\nwatched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his\nalready disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there\nwas no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea\ndel Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin's promises could\nnot lie. Full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended a rising\nground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight of which\nSancho fell on his knees exclaiming, \"Open thine eyes, longed-for home,\nand see how thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, if not very rich,\nvery well whipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thy son Don Quixote,\nwho, if he comes vanquished by the arm of another, comes victor over\nhimself, which, as he himself has told me, is the greatest victory anyone\ncan desire. I'm bringing back money, for if I was well whipped, I went\nmounted like a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Have done with these fooleries,\" said Don Quixote; \"let us push on\nstraight and get to our own place, where we will give free range to our\nfancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.\"\n\nWith this they descended the slope and directed their steps to their\nvillage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nOF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD AS HE ENTERED HIS OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHER\nINCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORY\n\n\nAt the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw two\nboys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor one of whom said to the\nother, \"Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as long\nas thou livest.\"\n\nDon Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, \"Dost thou not mark,\nfriend, what that boy said, 'Thou shalt never see it again as long as\nthou livest'?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sancho, \"what does it matter if the boy said so?\"\n\n\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"dost thou not see that, applied to the object\nof my desires, the words mean that I am never to see Dulcinea more?\"\n\nSancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a\nhare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and\nsportsmen. In its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under\nDapple. Sancho caught it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was\nsaying, \"Malum signum, malum signum! a hare flies, greyhounds chase it,\nDulcinea appears not.\"\n\n\"Your worship's a strange man,\" said Sancho; \"let's take it for granted\nthat this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds chasing it the malignant\nenchanters who turned her into a country wench; she flies, and I catch\nher and put her into your worship's hands, and you hold her in your arms\nand cherish her; what bad sign is that, or what ill omen is there to be\nfound here?\"\n\nThe two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and\nSancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was answered by\nthe one who had said, \"Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou\nlivest,\" that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other boy,\nand did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. Sancho took\nout four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the cage,\nwhich he placed in Don Quixote's hands, saying, \"There, senor! there are\nthe omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to do with our\naffairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year's clouds; and\nif I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our village say that it\ndoes not become Christians or sensible people to give any heed to these\nsilly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some time ago,\ntelling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there's\nno need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our\nvillage.\"\n\nThe sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave\nthem. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town\nthey came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with\ntheir breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way\nof a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the\nbuckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the\nduke's castle the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed\nthe mitre on Dapple's head, the oddest transformation and decoration that\never ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by both the\ncurate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. Don\nQuixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys,\nwho are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass's mitre and came\nrunning to see it, calling out to one another, \"Come here, boys, and see\nSancho Panza's ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote's beast\nleaner than ever.\"\n\nSo at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the\ncurate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and\nproceeded to Don Quixote's house, at the door of which they found his\nhousekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already reached.\nIt had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho's wife, as well, and she with\nher hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica her daughter by the\nhand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him coming in by no means\nas good case as she thought a governor ought to be, she said to him, \"How\nis it you come this way, husband? It seems to me you come tramping and\nfootsore, and looking more like a disorderly vagabond than a governor.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \"often 'where there are pegs\nthere are no flitches;' let's go into the house and there you'll hear\nstrange things. I bring money, and that's the main thing, got by my own\nindustry without wronging anybody.\"\n\n\"You bring the money, my good husband,\" said Teresa, \"and no matter\nwhether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have got it,\nyou'll not have brought any new practice into the world.\"\n\nSanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything,\nfor she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she\ntaking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand,\nwhile the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don\nQuixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the\ncompany of the curate and the bachelor.\n\nDon Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in\nprivate with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of\nhis defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village\nfor a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a\nhair's breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous\ngood faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of\nturning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude\nof the fields, where he could with perfect freedom give range to his\nthoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he\nbesought them, if they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented\nby more important business, to consent to be his companions, for he would\nbuy sheep enough to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important\npoint of the whole affair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had\ngiven them names that would fit them to a T. The curate asked what they\nwere. Don Quixote replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd\nQuixotize and the bachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the\nshepherd Curambro, and Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino.\n\nBoth were astounded at Don Quixote's new craze; however, lest he should\nonce more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his\nchivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured,\nfell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one,\nand offered to share the life with him. \"And what's more,\" said Samson\nCarrasco, \"I am, as all the world knows, a very famous poet, and I'll be\nalways making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it may come into my\nhead, to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be\nroaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of us should choose\nthe name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses, and that\nwe should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without writing up and\ncarving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of love-smitten\nshepherds.\"\n\n\"That's the very thing,\" said Don Quixote; \"though I am relieved from\nlooking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there's the\npeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the ornament\nof these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the graces,\nand, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be it ever\nso hyperbolical.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the curate; \"but we the others must look about for\naccommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or\nanother.\"\n\n\"And,\" added Samson Carrasco, \"if they fail us, we can call them by the\nnames of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Filidas,\nAmarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell them\nin the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own. If my\nlady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana, I'll sing\nher praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I'll call her\nFrancenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same thing; and\nSancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife Teresa\nPanza as Teresaina.\"\n\nDon Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate\nbestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had\nmade, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could\nspare from his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him,\nrecommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat\nhimself to a suitable diet.\n\nIt so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of\nthem said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don\nQuixote, and said the niece, \"What's this, uncle? Now that we were\nthinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable\nlife there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and turn\n'young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going there?' Nay!\nindeed 'the straw is too hard now to make pipes of.'\"\n\n\"And,\" added the housekeeper, \"will your worship be able to bear, out in\nthe fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter, and the\nhowling of the wolves? Not you; for that's a life and a business for\nhardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they were\nin swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it's better to be a\nknight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, senor; take my advice--and I'm\nnot giving it to you full of bread and wine, but fasting, and with fifty\nyears upon my head--stay at home, look after your affairs, go often to\nconfession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be it if any evil comes\nto you.\"\n\n\"Hold your peace, my daughters,\" said Don Quixote; \"I know very well what\nmy duty is; help me to bed, for I don't feel very well; and rest assured\nthat, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall never fail\nto have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end.\" And the\ngood wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), the housekeeper and niece,\nhelped him to bed, where they gave him something to eat and made him as\ncomfortable as possible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nOF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIED\n\n\nAs nothing that is man's can last for ever, but all tends ever downwards\nfrom its beginning to its end, and above all man's life, and as Don\nQuixote's enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course,\nits end and close came when he least looked for it. For whether it was of\nthe dejection the thought of his defeat produced, or of heaven's will\nthat so ordered it--a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for\nsix days, during which he was often visited by his friends the curate,\nthe bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire Sancho Panza never\nquitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was grief at finding himself\nvanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation and\ndisenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,\nstrove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor\nbidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which\nhe himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the\nshine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own\nmoney two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the\nother Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.\n\nBut for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends\ncalled in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied\nwith it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to\nthe health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixote\nheard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire,\nwho fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. The\ndoctor's opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to\nhis end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had a\nwish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the\nsaying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought\nhe was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up,\nand in a loud voice exclaimed, \"Blessed be Almighty God, who has shown me\nsuch goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins of men\ncan neither limit them nor keep them back!\"\n\nThe niece listened with attention to her uncle's words, and they struck\nher as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least during his\nillness, so she asked, \"What are you saying, senor? Has anything strange\noccurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?\"\n\n\"The mercies, niece,\" said Don Quixote, \"are those that God has this\nmoment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no impediment to\nthem. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows of\nignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of\nchivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities and\ndeceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions\nhas come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading\nother books that might be a light to my soul. Niece, I feel myself at the\npoint of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my\nlife has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of a\nmadman; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should be\nmade plainer at my death. Call in to me, my dear, my good friends the\ncurate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for\nI wish to confess and make my will.\" But his niece was saved the trouble\nby the entrance of the three. The instant Don Quixote saw them he\nexclaimed, \"Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for him the name\nof Good. Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the whole countless\ntroop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profane stories of\nknight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril into which\nreading them brought me; now, by God's mercy schooled into my right\nsenses, I loathe them.\"\n\nWhen the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever\nthat some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson, \"What?\nSenor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcinea\nbeing disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the\npoint of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are\nyou thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven's sake, be rational and\nlet's have no more nonsense.\"\n\n\"All that nonsense,\" said Don Quixote, \"that until now has been a reality\nto my hurt, my death will, with heaven's help, turn to my good. I feel,\nsirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting; let me\nhave a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will; for in\nextremities like this, man must not trifle with his soul; and while the\ncurate is confessing me let some one, I beg, go for the notary.\"\n\nThey looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote's words; but, though\nuncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the signs by\nwhich they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden and\ncomplete return to his senses after having been mad; for to the words\nalready quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and so\nrational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound of\nmind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessed\nhim. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards\nwith him and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor\nthe condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece\nweeping, began to blubber and shed tears.\n\nThe confession over, the curate came out saying, \"Alonso Quixano the Good\nis indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to him\nwhile he makes his will.\"\n\nThis news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the\nhousekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears\nburst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a\ntruth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano\nthe Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a\ngentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,\nnot only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.\n\nThe notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will had\nbeen set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with all the\ndevout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said,\n\"Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of Sancho\nPanza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as between him and\nme there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no claim be\nmade against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect of them; but\nthat if anything remain over and above, after he has paid himself what I\nowe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall be his, and much\ngood may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a share in giving him\nthe government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses, I could give\nhim that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicity of his\ncharacter and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.\" And then, turning\nto Sancho, he said, \"Forgive me, my friend, that I led thee to seem as\nmad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I myself fell into,\nthat there were and still are knights-errant in the world.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sancho weeping, \"don't die, master, but take my advice and\nlive many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is to\nlet himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing him, or\nany hands but melancholy's making an end of him. Come, don't be lazy, but\nget up from your bed and let us take to the fields in shepherd's trim as\nwe agreed. Perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady Dulcinea\ndisenchanted, as fine as fine can be. If it be that you are dying of\nvexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say you were\noverthrown because I had girthed Rocinante badly; besides you must have\nseen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to\nupset one another, and for him who is conquered to-day to be conqueror\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Samson, \"and good Sancho Panza's view of these cases is\nquite right.\"\n\n\"Sirs, not so fast,\" said Don Quixote, \"'in last year's nests there are\nno birds this year.' I was mad, now I am in my senses; I was Don Quixote\nof La Mancha, I am now, as I said, Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my\nrepentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for\nme; and now let Master Notary proceed.\n\n\"Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my niece,\nhere present, after all has been deducted from the most available portion\nof it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made. And the\nfirst disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wages I owe\nfor the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, over and\nabove, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, now\npresent, I appoint my executors.\n\n\"Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to marry,\nshe shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained by\ninformation taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are; and\nif it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my niece\ninsists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall\nforfeit the whole of what I have left her, which my executors shall\ndevote to works of charity as they please.\n\n\"Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any happy\nchance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have\nwritten a history now going about under the title of 'Second Part of the\nAchievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,' they beg of him on my behalf\nas earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without intending\nit, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous absurdities as he\nhas written in it; for I am leaving the world with a feeling of\ncompunction at having provoked him to write them.\"\n\nWith this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he\nstretched himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter\nand made haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after\nthat on which he made his will he fainted away very often. The house was\nall in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and\nSancho Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or\nsoftens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be\nexpected to leave behind him.\n\nAt last Don Quixote's end came, after he had received all the sacraments,\nand had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of\nchivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book\nof chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so\ncalmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and\nlamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died.\nOn perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso\nQuixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed\naway from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this\ntestimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save\nCide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making\ninterminable stories out of his achievements.\n\nSuch was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village\nCide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns\nand villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to\nadopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended\nfor Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are\nomitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco,\nhowever, put the following lines:\n\nA doughty gentleman lies here;\nA stranger all his life to fear;\nNor in his death could Death prevail,\nIn that last hour, to make him quail.\nHe for the world but little cared;\nAnd at his feats the world was scared;\nA crazy man his life he passed,\nBut in his senses died at last.\n\nAnd said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, \"Rest here, hung up by this\nbrass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or clumsy\ncut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless\npresumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.\nBut ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them:\n\nHold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!\n  Adventure it let none,\nFor this emprise, my lord the king,\n  Was meant for me alone.\n\nFor me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act, mine\nto write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in spite of\nthat pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venture\nwith his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write the\nachievements of my valiant knight;--no burden for his shoulders, nor\nsubject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to know\nhim, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering\nbones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in opposition\nto all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from the\ngrave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length,\npowerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that he\nhas already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to\nwhom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, are\nquite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of\nthose made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt\nthou discharge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that\nbears ill-will to thee. And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have\nbeen the first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as\nhe could desire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to\nthe detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of\nchivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now\ntottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell.\"", "title": "Don Quixote"}
