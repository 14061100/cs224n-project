{"summary": "The story depicts the Spanish Inquisition. An unnamed narrator is brought to trial before sinister judges. Poe provides no explanation of why he is there or what he has been arrested for. Before him are seven tall white candles on a table, and, as they melt, his hopes of survival also diminish. He is condemned to death and finds himself in a pitch black compartment. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers that he is in a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing a hem from his robe against a wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.\nWhen he reawakens he discovers food and water nearby. He tries to measure the cell again, and finds that the perimeter measures one hundred steps. While crossing the room he slips on the hem of his robe and discovers that if he had not tripped, he would have walked into a deep pit in the center of the cell, with water at the bottom.\nAfter losing consciousness again the narrator discovers that the prison is slightly illuminated and that he is bound to a wooden board by ropes. He looks up to see a painted picture of Father Time on the ceiling. Hanging from the figure is a gigantic pendulum with a crescent razor measuring \"one feet from horn to horn,\" and swinging slowly back and forth. The pendulum is inexorably sliding downwards and will eventually kill him. However, the condemned man is able to attract rats to his bonds with the meat left for him to eat and they start chewing through the ropes. As the pendulum reaches a point inches above his heart, the prisoner breaks free of the ropes and watches as the pendulum is drawn back to the ceiling.\nHe then sees that the walls have become red-hot and have begun moving inwards, driving him into the center of the room and towards the brink of the pit. As he gazes into the pit, he decides that no fate could be worse than falling into it: \"Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits -- that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.\"\nAs the narrator moves back from the pit, he sees that the red-hot walls are leaving him with no foothold. As he begins to fall into the pit, he hears human voices, a loud trumpeting, and a huge boom as loud as \"a thousand thunders.\" The walls rush back and an arm catches him. The French Army has taken Toledo and the Inquisition is in the hands of its enemies.\n\n", "full_text": "THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLEN POE\n\nVOLUME II\n\nThe Raven Edition\n\n[Redactor's Note--Some endnotes are by Poe and some were added by\nGriswold.

Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or\nbook-closet, au troisieme, No. 33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain. For\none hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to\nany casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied\nwith the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the\nchamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics\nwhich had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period\nof the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery\nattending the murder of Marie Roget. I looked upon it, therefore, as\nsomething of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown\nopen and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G--, the Prefect of the\nParisian police.\n\nWe gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the\nentertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen\nhim for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now\narose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without\ndoing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather\nto ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had\noccasioned a great deal of trouble.\n\n\"If it is any point requiring reflection,\" observed Dupin, as he\nforebore to enkindle the wick, \"we shall examine it to better purpose in\nthe dark.\"\n\n\"That is another of your odd notions,\" said the Prefect, who had a\nfashion of calling every thing \"odd\" that was beyond his comprehension,\nand thus lived amid an absolute legion of \"oddities.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe, and\nrolled towards him a comfortable chair.\n\n\"And what is the difficulty now?\" I asked. \"Nothing more in the\nassassination way, I hope?\"\n\n\"Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is, the business is very simple\nindeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well\nourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of\nit, because it is so excessively odd.\"\n\n\"Simple and odd,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"Why, yes; and not exactly that, either. The fact is, we have all been\na good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us\naltogether.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at\nfault,\" said my friend.\n\n\"What nonsense you do talk!\" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.\n\n\"Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?\"\n\n\"A little too self-evident.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha--ha! ha! ha!--ho! ho! ho!\" roared our visiter, profoundly\namused, \"oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!\"\n\n\"And what, after all, is the matter on hand?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, I will tell you,\" replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady\nand contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. \"I will tell\nyou in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this\nis an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most\nprobably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it\nto any one.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said I.\n\n\"Or not,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high\nquarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has been\npurloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is\nknown; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also,\nthat it still remains in his possession.\"\n\n\"How is this known?\" asked Dupin.\n\n\"It is clearly inferred,\" replied the Prefect, \"from the nature of the\ndocument, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at\nonce arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; that is to\nsay, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.\"\n\n\"Be a little more explicit,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder\na certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely\nvaluable.\" The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.\n\n\"Still I do not quite understand,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall\nbe nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most\nexalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an\nascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so\njeopardized.\"\n\n\"But this ascendancy,\" I interposed, \"would depend upon the robber's\nknowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare--\"\n\n\"The thief,\" said G., \"is the Minister D--, who dares all things, those\nunbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was\nnot less ingenious than bold. The document in question--a letter, to\nbe frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the\nroyal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the\nentrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her\nwish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in\na drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The\naddress, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the\nletter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D--. His\nlynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting\nof the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and\nfathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in\nhis ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one\nin question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in\nclose juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen\nminutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes\nalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful\nowner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the\npresence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister\ndecamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.\"\n\n\"Here, then,\" said Dupin to me, \"you have precisely what you demand\nto make the ascendancy complete--the robber's knowledge of the loser's\nknowledge of the robber.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Prefect; \"and the power thus attained has, for some\nmonths past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous\nextent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of\nthe necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be\ndone openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to\nme.\"\n\n\"Than whom,\" said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, \"no more\nsagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined.\"\n\n\"You flatter me,\" replied the Prefect; \"but it is possible that some\nsuch opinion may have been entertained.\"\n\n\"It is clear,\" said I, \"as you observe, that the letter is still in\npossession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any\nemployment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment\nthe power departs.\"\n\n\"True,\" said G.; \"and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care\nwas to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief\nembarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.\nBeyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result\nfrom giving him reason to suspect our design.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"you are quite au fait in these investigations. The\nParisian police have done this thing often before.\"\n\n\"O yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the\nminister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from\nhome all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a\ndistance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans,\nare readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can\nopen any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has\nnot passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged,\npersonally, in ransacking the D-- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to\nmention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon\nthe search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more\nastute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and\ncorner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be\nconcealed.\"\n\n\"But is it not possible,\" I suggested, \"that although the letter may\nbe in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have\nconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?\"\n\n\"This is barely possible,\" said Dupin. \"The present peculiar condition\nof affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D--\nis known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the\ndocument--its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice--a\npoint of nearly equal importance with its possession.\"\n\n\"Its susceptibility of being produced?\" said I.\n\n\"That is to say, of being destroyed,\" said Dupin.\n\n\"True,\" I observed; \"the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for\nits being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out\nof the question.\"\n\n\"Entirely,\" said the Prefect. \"He has been twice waylaid, as if by\nfootpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.\"\n\n\"You might have spared yourself this trouble,\" said Dupin. \"D--, I\npresume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated\nthese waylayings, as a matter of course.\"\n\n\"Not altogether a fool,\" said G., \"but then he's a poet, which I take to\nbe only one remove from a fool.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from\nhis meerschaum, \"although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.\"\n\n\"Suppose you detail,\" said I, \"the particulars of your search.\"\n\n\"Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched every where. I have\nhad long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room\nby room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined,\nfirst, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer;\nand I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a\nthing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a\n'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so\nplain. There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for\nin every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a\nline could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The\ncushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.\nFrom the tables we removed the tops.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of\nfurniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then\nthe leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the\ntop replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same\nway.\"\n\n\"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?\" I asked.\n\n\"By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding\nof cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to\nproceed without noise.\"\n\n\"But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces all\narticles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a\ndeposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into\na thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large\nknitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of\na chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?\"\n\n\"Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every\nchair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every description of\nfurniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been\nany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it\ninstantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been\nas obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gaping\nin the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.\"\n\n\"I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates,\nand you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains and\ncarpets.\"\n\n\"That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of\nthe furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself. We divided\nits entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that\nnone might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch\nthroughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining,\nwith the microscope, as before.\"\n\n\"The two houses adjoining!\" I exclaimed; \"you must have had a great deal\nof trouble.\"\n\n\"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!\"\n\n\"You include the grounds about the houses?\"\n\n\"All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively\nlittle trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it\nundisturbed.\"\n\n\"You looked among D--'s papers, of course, and into the books of the\nlibrary?\"\n\n\"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened\nevery book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting\nourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our\npolice officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover,\nwith the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most\njealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been\nrecently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the\nfact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just\nfrom the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with\nthe needles.\"\n\n\"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?\"\n\n\"Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the\nmicroscope.\"\n\n\"And the paper on the walls?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You looked into the cellars?\"\n\n\"We did.\"\n\n\"Then,\" I said, \"you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter\nis not upon the premises, as you suppose.\"\n\n\"I fear you are right there,\" said the Prefect. \"And now, Dupin, what\nwould you advise me to do?\"\n\n\"To make a thorough re-search of the premises.\"\n\n\"That is absolutely needless,\" replied G--. \"I am not more sure that I\nbreathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.\"\n\n\"I have no better advice to give you,\" said Dupin. \"You have, of course,\nan accurate description of the letter?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\"--And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book proceeded\nto read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the\nexternal appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing\nthe perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely\ndepressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. In\nabout a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied\nvery nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some\nordinary conversation. At length I said,--\n\n\"Well, but G--, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at\nlast made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the\nMinister?\"\n\n\"Confound him, say I--yes; I made the re-examination, however, as Dupin\nsuggested--but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be.\"\n\n\"How much was the reward offered, did you say?\" asked Dupin.\n\n\"Why, a very great deal--a very liberal reward--I don't like to say how\nmuch, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving\nmy individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could\nobtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more\nimportance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were\ntrebled, however, I could do no more than I have done.\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his\nmeerschaum, \"I really--think, G--, you have not exerted yourself--to the\nutmost in this matter. You might--do a little more, I think, eh?\"\n\n\"How?--in what way?'\n\n\"Why--puff, puff--you might--puff, puff--employ counsel in the\nmatter, eh?--puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of\nAbernethy?\"\n\n\"No; hang Abernethy!\"\n\n\"To be sure! hang him and welcome. But, once upon a time, a certain rich\nmiser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical\nopinion. Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a\nprivate company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an\nimaginary individual.\n\n\"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and\nsuch; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?'\n\n\"'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice, to be sure.'\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Prefect, a little discomposed, \"I am perfectly willing\nto take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand\nfrancs to any one who would aid me in the matter.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing\na check-book, \"you may as well fill me up a check for the amount\nmentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.\"\n\nI was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.\nFor some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking\nincredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed\nstarting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself in some\nmeasure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares,\nfinally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and\nhanded it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully\nand deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took\nthence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it\nin a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid\nglance at its contents, and then, scrambling and struggling to the\ndoor, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,\nwithout having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill\nup the check.\n\nWhen he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.\n\n\"The Parisian police,\" he said, \"are exceedingly able in their way.\nThey are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the\nknowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G--\ndetailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D--,\nI felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory\ninvestigation--so far as his labors extended.\"\n\n\"So far as his labors extended?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dupin. \"The measures adopted were not only the best of\ntheir kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been\ndeposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond\na question, have found it.\"\n\nI merely laughed--but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.\n\n\"The measures, then,\" he continued, \"were good in their kind, and well\nexecuted; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and\nto the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the\nPrefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his\ndesigns. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for\nthe matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I\nknew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game\nof 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple,\nand is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of\nthese toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd.\nIf the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The\nboy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he\nhad some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and\nadmeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant\nsimpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are\nthey even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the\nsecond trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton\nhad them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just\nsufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore\nguess odd;'--he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree\nabove the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in\nthe first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to\nhimself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd,\nas did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that\nthis is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting\nit even as before. I will therefore guess even;'--he guesses even, and\nwins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows\ntermed 'lucky,'--what, in its last analysis, is it?\"\n\n\"It is merely,\" I said, \"an identification of the reasoner's intellect\nwith that of his opponent.\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Dupin; \"and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he\neffected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I\nreceived answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how\nstupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts\nat the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as\npossible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see\nwhat thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\ncorrespond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at\nthe bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to\nRochefoucault, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.\"\n\n\"And the identification,\" I said, \"of the reasoner's intellect with that\nof his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy\nwith which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.\"\n\n\"For its practical value it depends upon this,\" replied Dupin; \"and the\nPrefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this\nidentification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through\nnon-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They\nconsider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for\nanything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have\nhidden it. They are right in this much--that their own ingenuity is a\nfaithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the\nindividual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils\nthem, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and\nvery usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in\ntheir investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency--by\nsome extraordinary reward--they extend or exaggerate their old modes of\npractice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this\ncase of D--, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is\nall this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the\nmicroscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered\nsquare inches--what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of\nthe one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon\nthe one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect,\nin the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he\nhas taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter,--not\nexactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg--but, at least, in some\nout-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought\nwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in\na chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for\nconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be\nadopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,\na disposal of the article concealed--a disposal of it in this recherche\nmanner,--is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed; and\nthus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether\nupon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and\nwhere the case is of importance--or, what amounts to the same thing in\nthe policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,--the qualities in\nquestion have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I\nmeant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where\nwithin the limits of the Prefect's examination--in other words, had the\nprinciple of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of\nthe Prefect--its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond\nquestion. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified;\nand the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the\nMinister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools\nare poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non\ndistributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.\"\n\n\"But is this really the poet?\" I asked. \"There are two brothers, I know;\nand both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has\nwritten learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician,\nand no poet.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and\nmathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could\nnot have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the\nPrefect.\"\n\n\"You surprise me,\" I said, \"by these opinions, which have been\ncontradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught\nthe well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long\nbeen regarded as the reason par excellence.\"\n\n\"'Il y a a parier,'\" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, \"'que toute\nidee publique, toute convention recue est une sottise, car elle a\nconvenue au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have\ndone their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and\nwhich is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an\nart worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term\n'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators\nof this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance--if\nwords derive any value from applicability--then 'analysis' conveys\n'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,'\n'religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorablemen.\"\n\n\"You have a quarrel on hand, I see,\" said I, \"with some of the\nalgebraists of Paris; but proceed.\"\n\n\"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which\nis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical.\nI dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The\nmathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning\nis merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great\nerror lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure\nalgebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious\nthat I am confounded at the universality with which it has been\nreceived. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is\ntrue of relation--of form and quantity--is often grossly false in regard\nto morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue\nthat the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the\naxiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives,\neach of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal\nto the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical\ntruths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the\nmathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if\nthey were of an absolutely general applicability--as the world indeed\nimagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions\nan analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan\nfables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make\ninferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists,\nhowever, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and\nthe inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as\nthrough an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet\nencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal\nroots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith\nthat x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of\nthese gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe\noccasions may occur where x2+px is not altogether equal to q, and,\nhaving made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as\nspeedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you\ndown.\n\n\"I mean to say,\" continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his\nlast observations, \"that if the Minister had been no more than a\nmathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving\nme this check. I know him, however, as both mathematician and poet,\nand my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the\ncircumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too,\nand as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be\naware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have\nfailed to anticipate--and events have proved that he did not fail to\nanticipate--the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have\nforeseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His\nfrequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect\nas certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford\nopportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to\nimpress them with the conviction to which G--, in fact, did finally\narrive--the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I\nfelt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains\nin detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of\npolicial action in searches for articles concealed--I felt that this\nwhole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the\nMinister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary\nnooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to\nsee that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be\nas open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the\ngimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that\nhe would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not\ndeliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember,\nperhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our\nfirst interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so\nmuch on account of its being so very self-evident.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would\nhave fallen into convulsions.\"\n\n\"The material world,\" continued Dupin, \"abounds with very strict\nanalogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been\ngiven to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made\nto strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description. The\nprinciple of the vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in\nphysics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a large\nbody is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that\nits subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it\nis, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more\nforcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those\nof inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed\nand full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again:\nhave you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-doors,\nare the most attractive of attention?\"\n\n\"I have never given the matter a thought,\" I said.\n\n\"There is a game of puzzles,\" he resumed, \"which is played upon a map.\nOne party playing requires another to find a given word--the name of\ntown, river, state or empire--any word, in short, upon the motley and\nperplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to\nembarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names;\nbut the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from\none end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered\nsigns and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being\nexcessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely\nanalogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers\nto pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too\npalpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above\nor beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought\nit probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter\nimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best\npreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.\n\n\"But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating\ningenuity of D--; upon the fact that the document must always have been\nat hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive\nevidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the\nlimits of that dignitary's ordinary search--the more satisfied I\nbecame that, to conceal this letter, the Minister had resorted to the\ncomprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at\nall.\n\n\"Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles,\nand called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial\nhotel. I found D-- at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual,\nand pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps,\nthe most really energetic human being now alive--but that is only when\nnobody sees him.\n\n\"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the\nnecessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and\nthoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only\nupon the conversation of my host.\n\n\"I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat,\nand upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other\npapers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here,\nhowever, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to\nexcite particular suspicion.\n\n\"At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a\ntrumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a\ndirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of\nthe mantel-piece. In this rack, which had three or four compartments,\nwere five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last\nwas much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the\nmiddle--as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up\nas worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the second. It had a\nlarge black seal, bearing the D-- cipher very conspicuously, and was\naddressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D--, the minister, himself.\nIt was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into\none of the uppermost divisions of the rack.\n\n\"No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be\nthat of which I was in search. To be sure, it was, to all appearance,\nradically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so\nminute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D--\ncipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S--\nfamily. Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and feminine;\nthere the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly\nbold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But,\nthen, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the\ndirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with\nthe true methodical habits of D--, and so suggestive of a design to\ndelude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document;\nthese things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this\ndocument, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly in\naccordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these\nthings, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came\nwith the intention to suspect.\n\n\"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a\nmost animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew\nwell had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention\nreally riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to\nmemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also\nfell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial\ndoubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper,\nI observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented\nthe broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having\nbeen once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed\ndirection, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original\nfold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter\nhad been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I\nbade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a\ngold snuff-box upon the table.\n\n\"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite\neagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged,\nhowever, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath\nthe windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful\nscreams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D-- rushed to a casement,\nthrew it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the\ncard-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by\na fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had carefully\nprepared at my lodgings--imitating the D-- cipher, very readily, by\nmeans of a seal formed of bread.\n\n\"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic\nbehavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women\nand children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the\nfellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When\nhe had gone, D-- came from the window, whither I had followed him\nimmediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him\nfarewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.\"\n\n\"But what purpose had you,\" I asked, \"in replacing the letter by a\nfac-simile? Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have\nseized it openly, and departed?\"\n\n\"D--,\" replied Dupin, \"is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His\nhotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had\nI made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the\nMinisterial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard\nof me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You\nknow my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of\nthe lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his\npower. She has now him in hers--since, being unaware that the letter is\nnot in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it\nwas. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political\ndestruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than\nawkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni;\nbut in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far\nmore easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have\nno sympathy--at least no pity--for him who descends. He is that monstrum\nhorrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I\nshould like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,\nwhen, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage'\nhe is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the\ncard-rack.\"\n\n\"How? did you put any thing particular in it?\"\n\n\"Why--it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank--that\nwould have been insulting. D--, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn,\nwhich I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as\nI knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the\nperson who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a\nclue. He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the\nmiddle of the blank sheet the words--\n\n\"'-- -- Un dessein si funeste, S'il n'est digne d'Atree, est digne de\nThyeste. They are to be found in Crebillon's 'Atree.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE THOUSAND-AND-SECOND TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE\n\n                     Truth is stranger than fiction.\n\n                              OLD SAYING.\n\nHAVING had occasion, lately, in the course of some Oriental\ninvestigations, to consult the Tellmenow Isitsoornot, a work which (like\nthe Zohar of Simeon Jochaides) is scarcely known at all, even in Europe;\nand which has never been quoted, to my knowledge, by any American--if\nwe except, perhaps, the author of the \"Curiosities of American\nLiterature\";--having had occasion, I say, to turn over some pages of the\nfirst-mentioned very remarkable work, I was not a little astonished to\ndiscover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error\nrespecting the fate of the vizier's daughter, Scheherazade, as that\nfate is depicted in the \"Arabian Nights\"; and that the denouement there\ngiven, if not altogether inaccurate, as far as it goes, is at least to\nblame in not having gone very much farther.\n\nFor full information on this interesting topic, I must refer the\ninquisitive reader to the \"Isitsoornot\" itself, but in the meantime, I\nshall be pardoned for giving a summary of what I there discovered.\n\nIt will be remembered, that, in the usual version of the tales, a\ncertain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen, not only\nputs her to death, but makes a vow, by his beard and the prophet, to\nespouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions, and the\nnext morning to deliver her up to the executioner.\n\nHaving fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter, and with a\nreligious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him\nas a man of devout feeling and excellent sense, he was interrupted one\nafternoon (no doubt at his prayers) by a visit from his grand vizier, to\nwhose daughter, it appears, there had occurred an idea.\n\nHer name was Scheherazade, and her idea was, that she would either\nredeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty, or perish,\nafter the approved fashion of all heroines, in the attempt.\n\nAccordingly, and although we do not find it to be leap-year (which\nmakes the sacrifice more meritorious), she deputes her father, the grand\nvizier, to make an offer to the king of her hand. This hand the king\neagerly accepts--(he had intended to take it at all events, and had put\noff the matter from day to day, only through fear of the vizier),--but,\nin accepting it now, he gives all parties very distinctly to understand,\nthat, grand vizier or no grand vizier, he has not the slightest design\nof giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges. When, therefore,\nthe fair Scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king, and did actually\nmarry him despite her father's excellent advice not to do any thing of\nthe kind--when she would and did marry him, I say, will I, nill I, it\nwas with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of\nthe case would allow.\n\nIt seems, however, that this politic damsel (who had been reading\nMachiavelli, beyond doubt), had a very ingenious little plot in her\nmind. On the night of the wedding, she contrived, upon I forget what\nspecious pretence, to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near\nthat of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed;\nand, a little before cock-crowing, she took care to awaken the good\nmonarch, her husband (who bore her none the worse will because he\nintended to wring her neck on the morrow),--she managed to awaken him, I\nsay, (although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion,\nhe slept well) by the profound interest of a story (about a rat and a\nblack cat, I think) which she was narrating (all in an undertone, of\ncourse) to her sister. When the day broke, it so happened that this\nhistory was not altogether finished, and that Scheherazade, in the\nnature of things could not finish it just then, since it was high time\nfor her to get up and be bowstrung--a thing very little more pleasant\nthan hanging, only a trifle more genteel.\n\nThe king's curiosity, however, prevailing, I am sorry to say, even over\nhis sound religious principles, induced him for this once to postpone\nthe fulfilment of his vow until next morning, for the purpose and with\nthe hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black\ncat (a black cat, I think it was) and the rat.\n\nThe night having arrived, however, the lady Scheherazade not only put\nthe finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat (the rat was blue)\nbut before she well knew what she was about, found herself deep in the\nintricacies of a narration, having reference (if I am not altogether\nmistaken) to a pink horse (with green wings) that went, in a violent\nmanner, by clockwork, and was wound up with an indigo key. With this\nhistory the king was even more profoundly interested than with the\nother--and, as the day broke before its conclusion (notwithstanding\nall the queen's endeavors to get through with it in time for the\nbowstringing), there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony\nas before, for twenty-four hours. The next night there happened a\nsimilar accident with a similar result; and then the next--and then\nagain the next; so that, in the end, the good monarch, having been\nunavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a\nperiod of no less than one thousand and one nights, either forgets it\naltogether by the expiration of this time, or gets himself absolved of\nit in the regular way, or (what is more probable) breaks it outright, as\nwell as the head of his father confessor. At all events, Scheherazade,\nwho, being lineally descended from Eve, fell heir, perhaps, to the whole\nseven baskets of talk, which the latter lady, we all know, picked up\nfrom under the trees in the garden of Eden--Scheherazade, I say, finally\ntriumphed, and the tariff upon beauty was repealed.\n\nNow, this conclusion (which is that of the story as we have it upon\nrecord) is, no doubt, excessively proper and pleasant--but alas! like\na great many pleasant things, is more pleasant than true, and I am\nindebted altogether to the \"Isitsoornot\" for the means of correcting the\nerror. \"Le mieux,\" says a French proverb, \"est l'ennemi du bien,\" and,\nin mentioning that Scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk,\nI should have added that she put them out at compound interest until\nthey amounted to seventy-seven.\n\n\"My dear sister,\" said she, on the thousand-and-second night, (I quote\nthe language of the \"Isitsoornot\" at this point, verbatim) \"my dear\nsister,\" said she, \"now that all this little difficulty about the\nbowstring has blown over, and that this odious tax is so happily\nrepealed, I feel that I have been guilty of great indiscretion in\nwithholding from you and the king (who I am sorry to say, snores--a\nthing no gentleman would do) the full conclusion of Sinbad the sailor.\nThis person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures\nthan those which I related; but the truth is, I felt sleepy on the\nparticular night of their narration, and so was seduced into cutting\nthem short--a grievous piece of misconduct, for which I only trust that\nAllah will forgive me. But even yet it is not too late to remedy my\ngreat neglect--and as soon as I have given the king a pinch or two in\norder to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise,\nI will forthwith entertain you (and him if he pleases) with the sequel\nof this very remarkable story.\"\n\nHereupon the sister of Scheherazade, as I have it from the\n\"Isitsoornot,\" expressed no very particular intensity of gratification;\nbut the king, having been sufficiently pinched, at length ceased\nsnoring, and finally said, \"hum!\" and then \"hoo!\" when the queen,\nunderstanding these words (which are no doubt Arabic) to signify that\nhe was all attention, and would do his best not to snore any more--the\nqueen, I say, having arranged these matters to her satisfaction,\nre-entered thus, at once, into the history of Sinbad the sailor:\n\n\"'At length, in my old age,' [these are the words of Sinbad himself, as\nretailed by Scheherazade]--'at length, in my old age, and after enjoying\nmany years of tranquillity at home, I became once more possessed of a\ndesire of visiting foreign countries; and one day, without acquainting\nany of my family with my design, I packed up some bundles of such\nmerchandise as was most precious and least bulky, and, engaged a porter\nto carry them, went with him down to the sea-shore, to await the arrival\nof any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some\nregion which I had not as yet explored.\n\n\"'Having deposited the packages upon the sands, we sat down beneath some\ntrees, and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a ship,\nbut during several hours we saw none whatever. At length I fancied that\nI could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound; and the porter, after\nlistening awhile, declared that he also could distinguish it. Presently\nit grew louder, and then still louder, so that we could have no doubt\nthat the object which caused it was approaching us. At length, on\nthe edge of the horizon, we discovered a black speck, which rapidly\nincreased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster, swimming\nwith a great part of its body above the surface of the sea. It came\ntoward us with inconceivable swiftness, throwing up huge waves of foam\naround its breast, and illuminating all that part of the sea through\nwhich it passed, with a long line of fire that extended far off into the\ndistance.\n\n\"'As the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly. Its length was equal\nto that of three of the loftiest trees that grow, and it was as wide as\nthe great hall of audience in your palace, O most sublime and munificent\nof the Caliphs. Its body, which was unlike that of ordinary fishes, was\nas solid as a rock, and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portion\nof it which floated above the water, with the exception of a narrow\nblood-red streak that completely begirdled it. The belly, which floated\nbeneath the surface, and of which we could get only a glimpse now and\nthen as the monster rose and fell with the billows, was entirely covered\nwith metallic scales, of a color like that of the moon in misty weather.\nThe back was flat and nearly white, and from it there extended upwards\nof six spines, about half the length of the whole body.\n\n\"'The horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive, but, as if\nto make up for this deficiency, it was provided with at least four\nscore of eyes, that protruded from their sockets like those of the green\ndragon-fly, and were arranged all around the body in two rows, one above\nthe other, and parallel to the blood-red streak, which seemed to answer\nthe purpose of an eyebrow. Two or three of these dreadful eyes were much\nlarger than the others, and had the appearance of solid gold.\n\n\"'Although this beast approached us, as I have before said, with the\ngreatest rapidity, it must have been moved altogether by necromancy--for\nit had neither fins like a fish nor web-feet like a duck, nor wings like\nthe seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel; nor yet\ndid it writhe itself forward as do the eels. Its head and its tail were\nshaped precisely alike, only, not far from the latter, were two small\nholes that served for nostrils, and through which the monster puffed\nout its thick breath with prodigious violence, and with a shrieking,\ndisagreeable noise.\n\n\"'Our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great, but it was\neven surpassed by our astonishment, when upon getting a nearer look, we\nperceived upon the creature's back a vast number of animals about the\nsize and shape of men, and altogether much resembling them, except that\nthey wore no garments (as men do), being supplied (by nature, no doubt)\nwith an ugly uncomfortable covering, a good deal like cloth, but fitting\nso tight to the skin, as to render the poor wretches laughably awkward,\nand put them apparently to severe pain. On the very tips of their heads\nwere certain square-looking boxes, which, at first sight, I thought\nmight have been intended to answer as turbans, but I soon discovered\nthat they were excessively heavy and solid, and I therefore concluded\nthey were contrivances designed, by their great weight, to keep the\nheads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders. Around\nthe necks of the creatures were fastened black collars, (badges of\nservitude, no doubt,) such as we keep on our dogs, only much wider\nand infinitely stiffer, so that it was quite impossible for these poor\nvictims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at\nthe same time; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of\ntheir noses--a view puggish and snubby in a wonderful, if not positively\nin an awful degree.\n\n\"'When the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood, it\nsuddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent, and emitted from\nit a terrible flash of fire, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, and\na noise that I can compare to nothing but thunder. As the smoke cleared\naway, we saw one of the odd man-animals standing near the head of the\nlarge beast with a trumpet in his hand, through which (putting it to\nhis mouth) he presently addressed us in loud, harsh, and disagreeable\naccents, that, perhaps, we should have mistaken for language, had they\nnot come altogether through the nose.\n\n\"'Being thus evidently spoken to, I was at a loss how to reply, as I\ncould in no manner understand what was said; and in this difficulty\nI turned to the porter, who was near swooning through affright, and\ndemanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was, what\nit wanted, and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed\nupon its back. To this the porter replied, as well as he could for\ntrepidation, that he had once before heard of this sea-beast; that it\nwas a cruel demon, with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire, created\nby evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind; that the\nthings upon its back were vermin, such as sometimes infest cats and\ndogs, only a little larger and more savage; and that these vermin had\ntheir uses, however evil--for, through the torture they caused the beast\nby their nibbling and stingings, it was goaded into that degree of wrath\nwhich was requisite to make it roar and commit ill, and so fulfil the\nvengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii.\n\n\"This account determined me to take to my heels, and, without once even\nlooking behind me, I ran at full speed up into the hills, while the\nporter ran equally fast, although nearly in an opposite direction, so\nthat, by these means, he finally made his escape with my bundles, of\nwhich I have no doubt he took excellent care--although this is a point I\ncannot determine, as I do not remember that I ever beheld him again.\n\n\"'For myself, I was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the men-vermin (who\nhad come to the shore in boats) that I was very soon overtaken, bound\nhand and foot, and conveyed to the beast, which immediately swam out\nagain into the middle of the sea.\n\n\"'I now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to\nperil my life in such adventures as this; but regret being useless, I\nmade the best of my condition, and exerted myself to secure the goodwill\nof the man-animal that owned the trumpet, and who appeared to exercise\nauthority over his fellows. I succeeded so well in this endeavor that,\nin a few days, the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his\nfavor, and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the\nrudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language; so\nthat, at length, I was enabled to converse with it readily, and came to\nmake it comprehend the ardent desire I had of seeing the world.\n\n\"'Washish squashish squeak, Sinbad, hey-diddle diddle, grunt unt\ngrumble, hiss, fiss, whiss,' said he to me, one day after dinner--but\nI beg a thousand pardons, I had forgotten that your majesty is not\nconversant with the dialect of the Cock-neighs (so the man-animals were\ncalled; I presume because their language formed the connecting\nlink between that of the horse and that of the rooster). With your\npermission, I will translate. 'Washish squashish,' and so forth:--that\nis to say, 'I am happy to find, my dear Sinbad, that you are really a\nvery excellent fellow; we are now about doing a thing which is called\ncircumnavigating the globe; and since you are so desirous of seeing the\nworld, I will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of\nthe beast.'\"\n\nWhen the Lady Scheherazade had proceeded thus far, relates the\n\"Isitsoornot,\" the king turned over from his left side to his right, and\nsaid:\n\n\"It is, in fact, very surprising, my dear queen, that you omitted,\nhitherto, these latter adventures of Sinbad. Do you know I think them\nexceedingly entertaining and strange?\"\n\nThe king having thus expressed himself, we are told, the fair\nScheherazade resumed her history in the following words:\n\n\"Sinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliph--'I\nthanked the man-animal for its kindness, and soon found myself very much\nat home on the beast, which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean;\nalthough the surface of the latter is, in that part of the world, by\nno means flat, but round like a pomegranate, so that we went--so to\nsay--either up hill or down hill all the time.'\n\n\"That I think, was very singular,\" interrupted the king.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it is quite true,\" replied Scheherazade.\n\n\"I have my doubts,\" rejoined the king; \"but, pray, be so good as to go\non with the story.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the queen. \"'The beast,' continued Sinbad to the caliph,\n'swam, as I have related, up hill and down hill until, at length, we\narrived at an island, many hundreds of miles in circumference, but\nwhich, nevertheless, had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony\nof little things like caterpillars'\" (*1)\n\n\"Hum!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Leaving this island,' said Sinbad--(for Scheherazade, it must be\nunderstood, took no notice of her husband's ill-mannered ejaculation)\n'leaving this island, we came to another where the forests were of solid\nstone, and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finest-tempered axes\nwith which we endeavoured to cut them down.\"' (*2)\n\n\"Hum!\" said the king, again; but Scheherazade, paying him no attention,\ncontinued in the language of Sinbad.\n\n\"'Passing beyond this last island, we reached a country where there\nwas a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the\nbowels of the earth, and that contained a greater number of far more\nspacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all\nDamascus and Bagdad. From the roofs of these palaces there hung myriads\nof gems, liked diamonds, but larger than men; and in among the streets\nof towers and pyramids and temples, there flowed immense rivers as black\nas ebony, and swarming with fish that had no eyes.'\" (*3)\n\n\"Hum!\" said the king. \"'We then swam into a region of the sea where\nwe found a lofty mountain, down whose sides there streamed torrents of\nmelted metal, some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long\n(*4); while from an abyss on the summit, issued so vast a quantity of\nashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens, and it\nbecame darker than the darkest midnight; so that when we were even at\nthe distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain, it was\nimpossible to see the whitest object, however close we held it to our\neyes.'\" (*5)\n\n\"Hum!\" said the king.\n\n\"'After quitting this coast, the beast continued his voyage until we met\nwith a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed--for we here\nsaw a great lake, at the bottom of which, more than a hundred feet\nbeneath the surface of the water, there flourished in full leaf a forest\nof tall and luxuriant trees.'\" (*6)\n\n\"Hoo!\" said the king.\n\n\"Some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the\natmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel, just as our own\ndoes feather.'\" (*7)\n\n\"Fiddle de dee,\" said the king.\n\n\"Proceeding still in the same direction, we presently arrived at the\nmost magnificent region in the whole world. Through it there meandered\na glorious river for several thousands of miles. This river was of\nunspeakable depth, and of a transparency richer than that of amber.\nIt was from three to six miles in width; and its banks which arose on\neither side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height, were crowned\nwith ever-blossoming trees and perpetual sweet-scented flowers, that\nmade the whole territory one gorgeous garden; but the name of this\nluxuriant land was the Kingdom of Horror, and to enter it was inevitable\ndeath'\" (*8)\n\n\"Humph!\" said the king.\n\n\"'We left this kingdom in great haste, and, after some days, came to\nanother, where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous\nanimals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads. These hideous\nbeasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil, of a funnel shape,\nand line the sides of them with rocks, so disposed one upon the other\nthat they fall instantly, when trodden upon by other animals, thus\nprecipitating them into the monster's dens, where their blood is\nimmediately sucked, and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously\nout to an immense distance from \"the caverns of death.\"'\" (*9)\n\n\"Pooh!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Continuing our progress, we perceived a district with vegetables that\ngrew not upon any soil but in the air. (*10) There were others that\nsprang from the substance of other vegetables; (*11) others that derived\ntheir substance from the bodies of living animals; (*12) and then again,\nthere were others that glowed all over with intense fire; (*13) others\nthat moved from place to place at pleasure, (*14) and what was still\nmore wonderful, we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved\ntheir limbs at will and had, moreover, the detestable passion of mankind\nfor enslaving other creatures, and confining them in horrid and solitary\nprisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks.'\" (*15)\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Quitting this land, we soon arrived at another in which the bees and\nthe birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition, that they\ngive daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men\nof the empire. The king of the place having offered a reward for the\nsolution of two very difficult problems, they were solved upon the\nspot--the one by the bees, and the other by the birds; but the king\nkeeping their solution a secret, it was only after the most profound\nresearches and labor, and the writing of an infinity of big books,\nduring a long series of years, that the men-mathematicians at length\narrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by\nthe bees and by the birds.'\" (*16)\n\n\"Oh my!\" said the king.\n\n\"'We had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves\nclose upon another, from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock\nof fowls a mile in breadth, and two hundred and forty miles long; so\nthat, although they flew a mile during every minute, it required no less\nthan four hours for the whole flock to pass over us--in which there were\nseveral millions of millions of fowl.'\" (*17)\n\n\"Oh fy!\" said the king.\n\n\"'No sooner had we got rid of these birds, which occasioned us great\nannoyance, than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another\nkind, and infinitely larger than even the rocs which I met in my\nformer voyages; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your\nseraglio, oh, most Munificent of Caliphs. This terrible fowl had no head\nthat we could perceive, but was fashioned entirely of belly, which was\nof a prodigious fatness and roundness, of a soft-looking substance,\nsmooth, shining and striped with various colors. In its talons, the\nmonster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens, a house from which\nit had knocked off the roof, and in the interior of which we distinctly\nsaw human beings, who, beyond doubt, were in a state of frightful\ndespair at the horrible fate which awaited them. We shouted with all our\nmight, in the hope of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey,\nbut it merely gave a snort or puff, as if of rage and then let fall upon\nour heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand!'\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" said the king.\n\n\"'It was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of\nimmense extent and prodigious solidity, but which, nevertheless, was\nsupported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer\nthan four hundred horns.'\" (*18)\n\n\"That, now, I believe,\" said the king, \"because I have read something of\nthe kind before, in a book.\"\n\n\"'We passed immediately beneath this continent, (swimming in between the\nlegs of the cow), and, after some hours, found ourselves in a wonderful\ncountry indeed, which, I was informed by the man-animal, was his own\nnative land, inhabited by things of his own species. This elevated the\nman-animal very much in my esteem, and in fact, I now began to feel\nashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which I had treated him;\nfor I found that the man-animals in general were a nation of the most\npowerful magicians, who lived with worms in their brain, (*19) which,\nno doubt, served to stimulate them by their painful writhings and\nwrigglings to the most miraculous efforts of imagination!'\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Among the magicians, were domesticated several animals of very\nsingular kinds; for example, there was a huge horse whose bones were\niron and whose blood was boiling water. In place of corn, he had black\nstones for his usual food; and yet, in spite of so hard a diet, he was\nso strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the\ngrandest temple in this city, at a rate surpassing that of the flight of\nmost birds.'\" (*20)\n\n\"Twattle!\" said the king.\n\n\"'I saw, also, among these people a hen without feathers, but bigger\nthan a camel; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick; her\nblood, like that of the horse, (to whom, in fact, she was nearly\nrelated,) was boiling water; and like him she ate nothing but wood or\nblack stones. This hen brought forth very frequently, a hundred chickens\nin the day; and, after birth, they took up their residence for several\nweeks within the stomach of their mother.'\" (*21)\n\n\"Fa! lal!\" said the king.\n\n\"'One of this nation of mighty conjurors created a man out of brass and\nwood, and leather, and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would\nhave beaten at chess, all the race of mankind with the exception of the\ngreat Caliph, Haroun Alraschid. (*22) Another of these magi constructed\n(of like material) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him\nwho made it; for so great were its reasoning powers that, in a second,\nit performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have\nrequired the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year. (*23)\nBut a still more wonderful conjuror fashioned for himself a mighty thing\nthat was neither man nor beast, but which had brains of lead, intermixed\nwith a black matter like pitch, and fingers that it employed with such\nincredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in\nwriting out twenty thousand copies of the Koran in an hour, and this\nwith so exquisite a precision, that in all the copies there should not\nbe found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair.\nThis thing was of prodigious strength, so that it erected or overthrew\nthe mightiest empires at a breath; but its powers were exercised equally\nfor evil and for good.'\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Among this nation of necromancers there was also one who had in his\nveins the blood of the salamanders; for he made no scruple of sitting\ndown to smoke his chibouc in a red-hot oven until his dinner was\nthoroughly roasted upon its floor. (*24) Another had the faculty of\nconverting the common metals into gold, without even looking at them\nduring the process. (*25) Another had such a delicacy of touch that he\nmade a wire so fine as to be invisible. (*26) Another had such quickness\nof perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic\nbody, while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine\nhundred millions of times in a second.'\" (*27)\n\n\"Absurd!\" said the king.\n\n\"'Another of these magicians, by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet\nsaw, could make the corpses of his friends brandish their arms, kick out\ntheir legs, fight, or even get up and dance at his will. (*28) Another\nhad cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made\nhimself heard from one end of the world to the other. (*29) Another had\nso long an arm that he could sit down in Damascus and indite a letter\nat Bagdad--or indeed at any distance whatsoever. (*30) Another commanded\nthe lightning to come down to him out of the heavens, and it came at his\ncall; and served him for a plaything when it came. Another took two\nloud sounds and out of them made a silence. Another constructed a\ndeep darkness out of two brilliant lights. (*31) Another made ice in a\nred-hot furnace. (*32) Another directed the sun to paint his portrait,\nand the sun did. (*33) Another took this luminary with the moon and the\nplanets, and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy, probed\ninto their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which\nthey were made. But the whole nation is, indeed, of so surprising a\nnecromantic ability, that not even their infants, nor their commonest\ncats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at\nall, or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation\nitself had been blotted out from the face of creation.\"' (*34)\n\n\"Preposterous!\" said the king.\n\n\"'The wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi,'\"\ncontinued Scheherazade, without being in any manner disturbed by\nthese frequent and most ungentlemanly interruptions on the part of her\nhusband--\"'the wives and daughters of these eminent conjurers are every\nthing that is accomplished and refined; and would be every thing that is\ninteresting and beautiful, but for an unhappy fatality that besets them,\nand from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and\nfathers has, hitherto, been adequate to save. Some fatalities come in\ncertain shapes, and some in others--but this of which I speak has come\nin the shape of a crotchet.'\"\n\n\"A what?\" said the king.\n\n\"'A crotchet'\" said Scheherazade. \"'One of the evil genii, who are\nperpetually upon the watch to inflict ill, has put it into the heads of\nthese accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal\nbeauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies\nnot very far below the small of the back. Perfection of loveliness, they\nsay, is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump. Having been long\npossessed of this idea, and bolsters being cheap in that country, the\ndays have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from\na dromedary-'\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said the king--\"I can't stand that, and I won't. You have\nalready given me a dreadful headache with your lies. The day, too, I\nperceive, is beginning to break. How long have we been married?--my\nconscience is getting to be troublesome again. And then that dromedary\ntouch--do you take me for a fool? Upon the whole, you might as well get\nup and be throttled.\"\n\nThese words, as I learn from the \"Isitsoornot,\" both grieved and\nastonished Scheherazade; but, as she knew the king to be a man of\nscrupulous integrity, and quite unlikely to forfeit his word, she\nsubmitted to her fate with a good grace. She derived, however, great\nconsolation, (during the tightening of the bowstring,) from the\nreflection that much of the history remained still untold, and that the\npetulance of her brute of a husband had reaped for him a most righteous\nreward, in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures.\n\n\n\n\nA DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROeM.\n\n  The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our\n  ways;  nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the\n  vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works, which have\n  a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.\n\n  Joseph Glanville.\n\nWE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the\nold man seemed too much exhausted to speak.\n\n\"Not long ago,\" said he at length, \"and I could have guided you on this\nroute as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about three years past,\nthere happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man--or\nat least such as no man ever survived to tell of--and the six hours of\ndeadly terror which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You\nsuppose me a _very_ old man--but I am not. It took less than a single\nday to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken\nmy limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least\nexertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can scarcely look\nover this little cliff without getting giddy?\"\n\nThe \"little cliff,\" upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself\ndown to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung over it, while\nhe was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme\nand slippery edge--this \"little cliff\" arose, a sheer unobstructed\nprecipice of black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet\nfrom the world of crags beneath us. Nothing would have tempted me to\nwithin half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited\nby the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length\nupon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even\nglance upward at the sky--while I struggled in vain to divest myself of\nthe idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from\nthe fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself into\nsufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.\n\n\"You must get over these fancies,\" said the guide, \"for I have brought\nyou here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that\nevent I mentioned--and to tell you the whole story with the spot just\nunder your eye.\"\n\n\"We are now,\" he continued, in that particularizing manner which\ndistinguished him--\"we are now close upon the Norwegian coast--in the\nsixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great province of Nordland--and\nin the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is\nHelseggen, the Cloudy. Now raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to\nthe grass if you feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapor\nbeneath us, into the sea.\"\n\nI looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore\nso inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the Nubian geographer's\naccount of the _Mare Tenebrarum_. A panorama more deplorably desolate no\nhuman imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye\ncould reach, there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines\nof horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but\nthe more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against\nits white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just\nopposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and at a\ndistance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible\na small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was\ndiscernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.\nAbout two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size,\nhideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a\ncluster of dark rocks.\n\nThe appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant\nisland and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although,\nat the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the\nremote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly\nplunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a\nregular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in\nevery direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam\nthere was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.\n\n\"The island in the distance,\" resumed the old man, \"is called by\nthe Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the\nnorthward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven,\nand Buckholm. Farther off--between Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm,\nFlimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the\nplaces--but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is\nmore than either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you\nsee any change in the water?\"\n\nWe had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which\nwe had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no\nglimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit. As the\nold man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound,\nlike the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie;\nand at the same moment I perceived that what seamen term the _chopping_\ncharacter of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current\nwhich set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired\na monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed--to its headlong\nimpetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed\ninto ungovernable fury; but it was between Moskoe and the coast that the\nmain uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of the waters, seamed\nand scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into\nphrensied convulsion--heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic\nand innumerable vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the\neastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in\nprecipitous descents.\n\nIn a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical\nalteration. The general surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the\nwhirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious streaks of foam\nbecame apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks,\nat length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into\ncombination, took unto themselves the gyratory motion of the\nsubsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of another more vast.\nSuddenly--very suddenly--this assumed a distinct and definite existence,\nin a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was\nrepresented by a broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this\nslipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far\nas the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of\nwater, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,\nspeeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion,\nand sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half\nroar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in\nits agony to Heaven.\n\nThe mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw\nmyself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of\nnervous agitation.\n\n\"This,\" said I at length, to the old man--\"this _can_ be nothing else\nthan the great whirlpool of the Maelstroem.\"\n\n\"So it is sometimes termed,\" said he. \"We Norwegians call it the\nMoskoe-stroem, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.\"\n\nThe ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me\nfor what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most\ncircumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception either\nof the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene--or of the wild\nbewildering sense of _the novel_ which confounds the beholder. I am not\nsure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at\nwhat time; but it could neither have been from the summit of Helseggen,\nnor during a storm. There are some passages of his description,\nnevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their\neffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the\nspectacle.\n\n\"Between Lofoden and Moskoe,\" he says, \"the depth of the water is\nbetween thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver\n(Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage\nfor a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which happens\neven in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the\ncountry between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the\nroar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest\nand most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off,\nand the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship\ncomes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down\nto the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and when\nthe water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these\nintervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and flood,\nand in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence\ngradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury\nheightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norway mile\nof it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding\nagainst it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens\nfrequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by\nits violence; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and\nbellowings in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A\nbear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the\nstream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on\nshore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the\ncurrent, rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew\nupon them. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks,\namong which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the\nflux and reflux of the sea--it being constantly high and low water every\nsix hours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday,\nit raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the\nhouses on the coast fell to the ground.\"\n\nIn regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have\nbeen ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The\n\"forty fathoms\" must have reference only to portions of the channel\nclose upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the\ncentre of the Moskoe-stroem must be immeasurably greater; and no better\nproof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the\nsidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the\nhighest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the\nhowling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity\nwith which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of\nbelief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared to\nme, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of the line in\nexistence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could\nresist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear\nbodily and at once.\n\nThe attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I remember,\nseemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now wore a very\ndifferent and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally received is that\nthis, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe islands, \"have\nno other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux\nand reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the\nwater so that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the\nhigher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural\nresult of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of which\nis sufficiently known by lesser experiments.\"--These are the words of\nthe Encyclopaedia Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the\ncentre of the channel of the Maelstroem is an abyss penetrating the\nglobe, and issuing in some very remote part--the Gulf of Bothnia being\nsomewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself,\nwas the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented;\nand, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say\nthat, although it was the view almost universally entertained of the\nsubject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. As to the\nformer notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I\nagreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether\nunintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.\n\n\"You have had a good look at the whirl now,\" said the old man, \"and if\nyou will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden\nthe roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will convince you I\nought to know something of the Moskoe-stroem.\"\n\nI placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.\n\n\"Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about\nseventy tons burthen, with which we were in the habit of fishing among\nthe islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at\nsea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has only the\ncourage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we\nthree were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the\nislands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower down to\nthe southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,\nand therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over here\namong the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far\ngreater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more\ntimid of the craft could not scrape together in a week. In fact, we made\nit a matter of desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead\nof labor, and courage answering for capital.\n\n\"We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than\nthis; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take advantage of\nthe fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the\nMoskoe-stroem, far above the pool, and then drop down upon anchorage\nsomewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the eddies are not so\nviolent as elsewhere. Here we used to remain until nearly time for\nslack-water again, when we weighed and made for home. We never set\nout upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and\ncoming--one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return--and\nwe seldom made a mis-calculation upon this point. Twice, during six\nyears, we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead\ncalm, which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to\nremain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a\ngale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel too\nboisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should have been\ndriven out to sea in spite of everything, (for the whirlpools threw us\nround and round so violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor\nand dragged it) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the\ninnumerable cross currents--here to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove\nus under the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.\n\n\"I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we\nencountered 'on the grounds'--it is a bad spot to be in, even in\ngood weather--but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the\nMoskoe-stroem itself without accident; although at times my heart has\nbeen in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before\nthe slack. The wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at\nstarting, and then we made rather less way than we could wish, while\nthe current rendered the smack unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son\neighteen years old, and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have\nbeen of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as\nafterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves,\nwe had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger--for,\nafter all is said and done, it _was_ a horrible danger, and that is the\ntruth.\n\n\"It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going to\ntell you occurred. It was on the tenth day of July, 18-, a day which the\npeople of this part of the world will never forget--for it was one\nin which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of\nthe heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the\nafternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,\nwhile the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us could\nnot have foreseen what was to follow.\n\n\"The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed over to the\nislands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly loaded the smack\nwith fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty that day\nthan we had ever known them. It was just seven, _by my watch_, when we\nweighed and started for home, so as to make the worst of the Stroem at\nslack water, which we knew would be at eight.\n\n\"We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for some\ntime spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger, for indeed\nwe saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it. All at once we\nwere taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen. This was most\nunusual--something that had never happened to us before--and I began to\nfeel a little uneasy, without exactly knowing why. We put the boat on\nthe wind, but could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was\nupon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking\nastern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-colored\ncloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.\n\n\"In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away, and we\nwere dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. This state of\nthings, however, did not last long enough to give us time to think about\nit. In less than a minute the storm was upon us--in less than two the\nsky was entirely overcast--and what with this and the driving spray, it\nbecame suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack.\n\n\"Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The\noldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let\nour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at the first\npuff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed\noff--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed\nhimself to it for safety.\n\n\"Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water.\nIt had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the bow, and\nthis hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about to\ncross the Stroem, by way of precaution against the chopping seas. But for\nthis circumstance we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely\nburied for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction I\ncannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining. For my part,\nas soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck,\nwith my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and with my hands\ngrasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the fore-mast. It was mere\ninstinct that prompted me to do this--which was undoubtedly the very\nbest thing I could have done--for I was too much flurried to think.\n\n\"For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all this\ntime I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I could stand it no\nlonger I raised myself upon my knees, still keeping hold with my hands,\nand thus got my head clear. Presently our little boat gave herself\na shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water, and thus rid\nherself, in some measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the\nbetter of the stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so\nas to see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm. It was\nmy elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made sure\nthat he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was turned into\nhorror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the word\n'_Moskoe-stroem!_'\n\n\"No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. I shook\nfrom head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the ague. I\nknew what he meant by that one word well enough--I knew what he wished\nto make me understand. With the wind that now drove us on, we were bound\nfor the whirl of the Stroem, and nothing could save us!\n\n\"You perceive that in crossing the Stroem _channel_, we always went a\nlong way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather, and then had\nto wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now we were driving right\nupon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as this! 'To be sure,' I\nthought, 'we shall get there just about the slack--there is some little\nhope in that'--but in the next moment I cursed myself for being so great\na fool as to dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed,\nhad we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.\n\n\"By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or perhaps\nwe did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at all events\nthe seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind, and lay flat\nand frothing, now got up into absolute mountains. A singular change,\ntoo, had come over the heavens. Around in every direction it was still\nas black as pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a\ncircular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep bright\nblue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that\nI never before knew her to wear. She lit up every thing about us with\nthe greatest distinctness--but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!\n\n\"I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but, in some\nmanner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I\ncould not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the top\nof my voice in his ear. Presently he shook his head, looking as pale as\ndeath, and held up one of his fingers, as if to say _'listen! '_\n\n\"At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a hideous thought\nflashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its fob. It was not going. I\nglanced at its face by the moonlight, and then burst into tears as I\nflung it far away into the ocean. _It had run down at seven o'clock!\nWe were behind the time of the slack, and the whirl of the Stroem was in\nfull fury!_\n\n\"When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden, the\nwaves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to slip\nfrom beneath her--which appears very strange to a landsman--and this is\nwhat is called _riding_, in sea phrase. Well, so far we had ridden the\nswells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us\nright under the counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--as\nif into the sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so\nhigh. And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge,\nthat made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty\nmountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown a quick\nglance around--and that one glance was all sufficient. I saw our exact\nposition in an instant. The Moskoe-Stroem whirlpool was about a quarter\nof a mile dead ahead--but no more like the every-day Moskoe-Stroem, than\nthe whirl as you now see it is like a mill-race. If I had not known\nwhere we were, and what we had to expect, I should not have recognised\nthe place at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.\nThe lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.\n\n\"It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we\nsuddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The\nboat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new\ndirection like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of\nthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a\nsound as you might imagine given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand\nsteam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the\nbelt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,\nthat another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could\nonly see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we\nwore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at\nall, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her\nstarboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world\nof ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and\nthe horizon.\n\n\"It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very jaws of the\ngulf, I felt more composed than when we were only approaching it. Having\nmade up my mind to hope no more, I got rid of a great deal of that\nterror which unmanned me at first. I suppose it was despair that strung\nmy nerves.\n\n\"It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I began to\nreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and how\nfoolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own\nindividual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of God's power.\nI do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind.\nAfter a little while I became possessed with the keenest curiosity about\nthe whirl itself. I positively felt a _wish_ to explore its depths, even\nat the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that\nI should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the\nmysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies to occupy\na man's mind in such extremity--and I have often thought since, that the\nrevolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little\nlight-headed.\n\n\"There was another circumstance which tended to restore my\nself-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could not\nreach us in our present situation--for, as you saw yourself, the belt of\nsurf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean, and this\nlatter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous ridge. If you\nhave never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the\nconfusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They\nblind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all power of action\nor reflection. But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these\nannoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty\nindulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.\n\n\"How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.\nWe careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather than\nfloating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge,\nand then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this time I\nhad never let go of the ring-bolt. My brother was at the stern, holding\non to a small empty water-cask which had been securely lashed under the\ncoop of the counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been\nswept overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the brink\nof the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from\nwhich, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands, as\nit was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp. I never felt\ndeeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act--although I knew he\nwas a madman when he did it--a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did\nnot care, however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make\nno difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have the\nbolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no great difficulty\nin doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough, and upon an even\nkeel--only swaying to and fro, with the immense sweeps and swelters of\nthe whirl. Scarcely had I secured myself in my new position, when we\ngave a wild lurch to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I\nmuttered a hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.\n\n\"As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively\ntightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. For some seconds\nI dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and\nwondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water.\nBut moment after moment elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had\nceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before,\nwhile in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more\nalong. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.\n\n\"Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration with\nwhich I gazed about me. The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by\nmagic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in\ncircumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth sides\nmight have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity\nwith which they spun around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance\nthey shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift\namid the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a flood of\ngolden glory along the black walls, and far away down into the inmost\nrecesses of the abyss.\n\n\"At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.\nThe general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld. When I\nrecovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell instinctively downward.\nIn this direction I was able to obtain an unobstructed view, from the\nmanner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool. She\nwas quite upon an even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane\nparallel with that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of\nmore than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our\nbeam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely\nmore difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,\nthan if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was owing to\nthe speed at which we revolved.\n\n\"The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound\ngulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly, on account of a\nthick mist in which everything there was enveloped, and over which there\nhung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow and tottering bridge which\nMussulmen say is the only pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist,\nor spray, was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of\nthe funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell that\nwent up to the Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to\ndescribe.\n\n\"Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam above, had\ncarried us a great distance down the slope; but our farther descent\nwas by no means proportionate. Round and round we swept--not with\nany uniform movement--but in dizzying swings and jerks, that sent\nus sometimes only a few hundred yards--sometimes nearly the complete\ncircuit of the whirl. Our progress downward, at each revolution, was\nslow, but very perceptible.\n\n\"Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were\nthus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the\nembrace of the whirl. Both above and below us were visible fragments of\nvessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with\nmany smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes,\nbarrels and staves. I have already described the unnatural curiosity\nwhich had taken the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow\nupon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began to\nwatch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our\ncompany. I _must_ have been delirious--for I even sought _amusement_\nin speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents\ntoward the foam below. 'This fir tree,' I found myself at one time\nsaying, 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge\nand disappears,'--and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of\na Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. At length, after\nmaking several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this\nfact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation--set me upon a train of\nreflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily\nonce more.\n\n\"It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a more\nexciting _hope_. This hope arose partly from memory, and partly from\npresent observation. I called to mind the great variety of buoyant\nmatter that strewed the coast of Lofoden, having been absorbed and\nthen thrown forth by the Moskoe-stroem. By far the greater number of the\narticles were shattered in the most extraordinary way--so chafed\nand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of\nsplinters--but then I distinctly recollected that there were _some_ of\nthem which were not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this\ndifference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the\nonly ones which had been _completely absorbed_--that the others had\nentered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason,\nhad descended so slowly after entering, that they did not reach the\nbottom before the turn of the flood came, or of the ebb, as the case\nmight be. I conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might\nthus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing\nthe fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more\nrapidly. I made, also, three important observations. The first was,\nthat, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid\ntheir descent--the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the\none spherical, and the other _of any other shape_, the superiority\nin speed of descent was with the sphere--the third, that, between two\nmasses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of any other\nshape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. Since my escape, I\nhave had several conversations on this subject with an old school-master\nof the district; and it was from him that I learned the use of the words\n'cylinder' and 'sphere.' He explained to me--although I have forgotten\nthe explanation--how what I observed was, in fact, the natural\nconsequence of the forms of the floating fragments--and showed me how it\nhappened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance\nto its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally\nbulky body, of any form whatever. (*1)\n\n\"There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in\nenforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them to\naccount, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed something\nlike a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel, while many of\nthese things, which had been on our level when I first opened my eyes\nupon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed\nto have moved but little from their original station.\n\n\"I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself securely to\nthe water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose from the counter,\nand to throw myself with it into the water. I attracted my brother's\nattention by signs, pointed to the floating barrels that came near us,\nand did everything in my power to make him understand what I was about\nto do. I thought at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether\nthis was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to\nmove from his station by the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him;\nthe emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I\nresigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the\nlashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with\nit into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.\n\n\"The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be. As it is myself\nwho now tell you this tale--as you see that I _did_ escape--and as you\nare already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected,\nand must therefore anticipate all that I have farther to say--I will\nbring my story quickly to conclusion. It might have been an hour, or\nthereabout, after my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a\nvast distance beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid\nsuccession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at\nonce and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The barrel to which I\nwas attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the\nbottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a\ngreat change took place in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of\nthe sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.\nThe gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent. By\ndegrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the\ngulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had gone\ndown, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I\nfound myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores\nof Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-stroem\n_had been_. It was the hour of the slack--but the sea still heaved\nin mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane. I was borne\nviolently into the channel of the Stroem, and in a few minutes was\nhurried down the coast into the 'grounds' of the fishermen. A boat\npicked me up--exhausted from fatigue--and (now that the danger was\nremoved) speechless from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on\nboard were my old mates and daily companions--but they knew me no more\nthan they would have known a traveller from the spirit-land. My hair\nwhich had been raven-black the day before, was as white as you see\nit now. They say too that the whole expression of my countenance had\nchanged. I told them my story--they did not believe it. I now tell it\nto _you_--and I can scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did\nthe merry fishermen of Lofoden.\"\n\n\n\n\nVON KEMPELEN AND HIS DISCOVERY\n\nAFTER THE very minute and elaborate paper by Arago, to say nothing of\nthe summary in 'Silliman's Journal,' with the detailed statement just\npublished by Lieutenant Maury, it will not be supposed, of course,\nthat in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to Von Kempelen's\ndiscovery, I have any design to look at the subject in a scientific\npoint of view. My object is simply, in the first place, to say a few\nwords of Von Kempelen himself (with whom, some years ago, I had the\nhonor of a slight personal acquaintance), since every thing which\nconcerns him must necessarily, at this moment, be of interest; and, in\nthe second place, to look in a general way, and speculatively, at the\nresults of the discovery.\n\nIt may be as well, however, to premise the cursory observations which\nI have to offer, by denying, very decidedly, what seems to be a\ngeneral impression (gleaned, as usual in a case of this kind, from the\nnewspapers), viz.: that this discovery, astounding as it unquestionably\nis, is unanticipated.\n\nBy reference to the 'Diary of Sir Humphrey Davy' (Cottle and Munroe,\nLondon, pp. 150), it will be seen at pp. 53 and 82, that this\nillustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question,\nbut had actually made no inconsiderable progress, experimentally, in the\nvery identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by Von\nKempelen, who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it, is,\nwithout doubt (I say it unhesitatingly, and can prove it, if required),\nindebted to the 'Diary' for at least the first hint of his own\nundertaking.\n\nThe paragraph from the 'Courier and Enquirer,' which is now going the\nrounds of the press, and which purports to claim the invention for a\nMr. Kissam, of Brunswick, Maine, appears to me, I confess, a little\napocryphal, for several reasons; although there is nothing either\nimpossible or very improbable in the statement made. I need not go into\ndetails. My opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its\nmanner. It does not look true. Persons who are narrating facts, are\nseldom so particular as Mr. Kissam seems to be, about day and date and\nprecise location. Besides, if Mr. Kissam actually did come upon the\ndiscovery he says he did, at the period designated--nearly eight years\nago--how happens it that he took no steps, on the instant, to reap the\nimmense benefits which the merest bumpkin must have known would have\nresulted to him individually, if not to the world at large, from the\ndiscovery? It seems to me quite incredible that any man of common\nunderstanding could have discovered what Mr. Kissam says he did, and yet\nhave subsequently acted so like a baby--so like an owl--as Mr. Kissam\nadmits that he did. By-the-way, who is Mr. Kissam? and is not the whole\nparagraph in the 'Courier and Enquirer' a fabrication got up to 'make\na talk'? It must be confessed that it has an amazingly moon-hoaxy-air.\nVery little dependence is to be placed upon it, in my humble opinion;\nand if I were not well aware, from experience, how very easily men of\nscience are mystified, on points out of their usual range of inquiry,\nI should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as\nProfessor Draper, discussing Mr. Kissam's (or is it Mr. Quizzem's?)\npretensions to the discovery, in so serious a tone.\n\nBut to return to the 'Diary' of Sir Humphrey Davy. This pamphlet was not\ndesigned for the public eye, even upon the decease of the writer, as any\nperson at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by\nthe slightest inspection of the style. At page 13, for example, near the\nmiddle, we read, in reference to his researches about the protoxide\nof azote: 'In less than half a minute the respiration being continued,\ndiminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure\non all the muscles.' That the respiration was not 'diminished,' is not\nonly clear by the subsequent context, but by the use of the plural,\n'were.' The sentence, no doubt, was thus intended: 'In less than half\na minute, the respiration [being continued, these feelings] diminished\ngradually, and were succeeded by [a sensation] analogous to gentle\npressure on all the muscles.' A hundred similar instances go to show\nthat the MS. so inconsiderately published, was merely a rough note-book,\nmeant only for the writer's own eye, but an inspection of the pamphlet\nwill convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion.\nThe fact is, Sir Humphrey Davy was about the last man in the world\nto commit himself on scientific topics. Not only had he a more than\nordinary dislike to quackery, but he was morbidly afraid of appearing\nempirical; so that, however fully he might have been convinced that he\nwas on the right track in the matter now in question, he would never\nhave spoken out, until he had every thing ready for the most practical\ndemonstration. I verily believe that his last moments would have been\nrendered wretched, could he have suspected that his wishes in regard\nto burning this 'Diary' (full of crude speculations) would have been\nunattended to; as, it seems, they were. I say 'his wishes,' for that he\nmeant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed\n'to be burnt,' I think there can be no manner of doubt. Whether it\nescaped the flames by good fortune or by bad, yet remains to be seen.\nThat the passages quoted above, with the other similar ones referred to,\ngave Von Kempelen the hint, I do not in the slightest degree question;\nbut I repeat, it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery\nitself (momentous under any circumstances) will be of service or\ndisservice to mankind at large. That Von Kempelen and his immediate\nfriends will reap a rich harvest, it would be folly to doubt for a\nmoment. They will scarcely be so weak as not to 'realize,' in time, by\nlarge purchases of houses and land, with other property of intrinsic\nvalue.\n\nIn the brief account of Von Kempelen which appeared in the\n'Home Journal,' and has since been extensively copied, several\nmisapprehensions of the German original seem to have been made by the\ntranslator, who professes to have taken the passage from a late number\nof the Presburg 'Schnellpost.' 'Viele' has evidently been misconceived\n(as it often is), and what the translator renders by 'sorrows,' is\nprobably 'lieden,' which, in its true version, 'sufferings,' would give\na totally different complexion to the whole account; but, of course,\nmuch of this is merely guess, on my part.\n\nVon Kempelen, however, is by no means 'a misanthrope,' in appearance, at\nleast, whatever he may be in fact. My acquaintance with him was casual\naltogether; and I am scarcely warranted in saying that I know him\nat all; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a\nnotoriety as he has attained, or will attain in a few days, is not a\nsmall matter, as times go.\n\n'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg\n(misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased\nin being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips,\nthat he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his\nparents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in\nsome way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he\nis short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers,\na wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There\nis some defect in one of his feet. His address is frank, and his whole\nmanner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and\nacts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. We were\nfellow-sojourners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, in\nProvidence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at\nvarious times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principal\ntopics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me\nto suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me,\nintending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter\ncity that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was\nthere that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about all\nthat I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have\nthought that even these few details would have interest for the public.\n\nThere can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat\nabout this affair are pure inventions, entitled to about as much credit\nas the story of Aladdin's lamp; and yet, in a case of this kind, as in\nthe case of the discoveries in California, it is clear that the truth\nmay be stranger than fiction. The following anecdote, at least, is so\nwell authenticated, that we may receive it implicitly.\n\nVon Kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence\nat Bremen; and often, it was well known, he had been put to extreme\nshifts in order to raise trifling sums. When the great excitement\noccurred about the forgery on the house of Gutsmuth & Co., suspicion\nwas directed toward Von Kempelen, on account of his having purchased\na considerable property in Gasperitch Lane, and his refusing, when\nquestioned, to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money. He\nwas at length arrested, but nothing decisive appearing against him, was\nin the end set at liberty. The police, however, kept a strict watch upon\nhis movements, and thus discovered that he left home frequently, taking\nalways the same road, and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the\nneighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known\nby the flash name of the 'Dondergat.' Finally, by dint of great\nperseverance, they traced him to a garret in an old house of seven\nstories, in an alley called Flatzplatz,--and, coming upon him suddenly,\nfound him, as they imagined, in the midst of his counterfeiting\noperations. His agitation is represented as so excessive that the\nofficers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt. After hand-cuffing\nhim, they searched his room, or rather rooms, for it appears he occupied\nall the mansarde.\n\nOpening into the garret where they caught him, was a closet, ten feet by\neight, fitted up with some chemical apparatus, of which the object has\nnot yet been ascertained. In one corner of the closet was a very small\nfurnace, with a glowing fire in it, and on the fire a kind of duplicate\ncrucible--two crucibles connected by a tube. One of these crucibles was\nnearly full of lead in a state of fusion, but not reaching up to the\naperture of the tube, which was close to the brim. The other crucible\nhad some liquid in it, which, as the officers entered, seemed to be\nfuriously dissipating in vapor. They relate that, on finding himself\ntaken, Kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands (which were encased\nin gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic), and threw the\ncontents on the tiled floor. It was now that they hand-cuffed him; and\nbefore proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person, but\nnothing unusual was found about him, excepting a paper parcel, in his\ncoat-pocket, containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture\nof antimony and some unknown substance, in nearly, but not quite, equal\nproportions. All attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have,\nso far, failed, but that it will ultimately be analyzed, is not to be\ndoubted.\n\nPassing out of the closet with their prisoner, the officers went through\na sort of ante-chamber, in which nothing material was found, to the\nchemist's sleeping-room. They here rummaged some drawers and boxes,\nbut discovered only a few papers, of no importance, and some good coin,\nsilver and gold. At length, looking under the bed, they saw a large,\ncommon hair trunk, without hinges, hasp, or lock, and with the top lying\ncarelessly across the bottom portion. Upon attempting to draw this trunk\nout from under the bed, they found that, with their united strength\n(there were three of them, all powerful men), they 'could not stir it\none inch.' Much astonished at this, one of them crawled under the bed,\nand looking into the trunk, said:\n\n'No wonder we couldn't move it--why it's full to the brim of old bits of\nbrass!'\n\nPutting his feet, now, against the wall so as to get a good purchase,\nand pushing with all his force, while his companions pulled with all\ntheirs, the trunk, with much difficulty, was slid out from under the\nbed, and its contents examined. The supposed brass with which it was\nfilled was all in small, smooth pieces, varying from the size of a pea\nto that of a dollar; but the pieces were irregular in shape, although\nmore or less flat-looking, upon the whole, 'very much as lead looks when\nthrown upon the ground in a molten state, and there suffered to grow\ncool.' Now, not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal\nto be any thing but brass. The idea of its being gold never entered\ntheir brains, of course; how could such a wild fancy have entered it?\nAnd their astonishment may be well conceived, when the next day it\nbecame known, all over Bremen, that the 'lot of brass' which they\nhad carted so contemptuously to the police office, without putting\nthemselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap, was not only\ngold--real gold--but gold far finer than any employed in coinage-gold,\nin fact, absolutely pure, virgin, without the slightest appreciable\nalloy.\n\nI need not go over the details of Von Kempelen's confession (as far as\nit went) and release, for these are familiar to the public. That he has\nactually realized, in spirit and in effect, if not to the letter, the\nold chimaera of the philosopher's stone, no sane person is at liberty\nto doubt. The opinions of Arago are, of course, entitled to the greatest\nconsideration; but he is by no means infallible; and what he says of\nbismuth, in his report to the Academy, must be taken cum grano salis.\nThe simple truth is, that up to this period all analysis has failed; and\nuntil Von Kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published\nenigma, it is more than probable that the matter will remain, for years,\nin statu quo. All that as yet can fairly be said to be known is, that\n'Pure gold can be made at will, and very readily from lead in connection\nwith certain other substances, in kind and in proportions, unknown.'\n\nSpeculation, of course, is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results\nof this discovery--a discovery which few thinking persons will hesitate\nin referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally,\nby the late developments in California; and this reflection brings us\ninevitably to another--the exceeding inopportuneness of Von Kempelen's\nanalysis. If many were prevented from adventuring to California, by the\nmere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value,\non account of its plentifulness in the mines there, as to render\nthe speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one--what\nimpression will be wrought now, upon the minds of those about to\nemigrate, and especially upon the minds of those actually in the\nmineral region, by the announcement of this astounding discovery of Von\nKempelen? a discovery which declares, in so many words, that beyond its\nintrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes (whatever that worth may be),\ngold now is, or at least soon will be (for it cannot be supposed that\nVon Kempelen can long retain his secret), of no greater value than\nlead, and of far inferior value to silver. It is, indeed, exceedingly\ndifficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of the\ndiscovery, but one thing may be positively maintained--that the\nannouncement of the discovery six months ago would have had material\ninfluence in regard to the settlement of California.\n\nIn Europe, as yet, the most noticeable results have been a rise of two\nhundred per cent. in the price of lead, and nearly twenty-five per cent.\nthat of silver.\n\n\n\n\nMESMERIC REVELATION\n\n WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the _rationale_ of mesmerism,\nits startling _facts_ are now almost universally admitted. Of these\nlatter, those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession--an\nunprofitable and disreputable tribe. There can be no more absolute waste\nof time than the attempt to _prove_, at the present day, that man, by\nmere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast him into an\nabnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble very closely those\nof _death_, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the\nphenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance; that,\nwhile in this state, the person so impressed employs only with effort,\nand then feebly, the external organs of sense, yet perceives, with\nkeenly refined perception, and through channels supposed unknown,\nmatters beyond the scope of the physical organs; that, moreover, his\nintellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his\nsympathies with the person so impressing him are profound; and, finally,\nthat his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,\nwhile, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are more\nextended and more _pronounced_.\n\n I say that these--which are the laws of mesmerism in its\ngeneral features--it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I\ninflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration; to-day. My purpose\nat present is a very different one indeed. I am impelled, even in\nthe teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment the very\nremarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between a sleep-waker and\nmyself.\n\n I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in\nquestion, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and\nexaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened. For many months he\nhad been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more distressing effects\nof which had been relieved by my manipulations; and on the night of\nWednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was summoned to his bedside.\n\n The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the\nheart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary\nsymptoms of asthma. In spasms such as these he had usually found relief\nfrom the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but to-night\nthis had been attempted in vain.\n\n As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and\nalthough evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite\nat ease.\n\n \"I sent for you to-night,\" he said, \"not so much to administer\nto my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal\nimpressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and\nsurprise. I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on the\ntopic of the soul's immortality. I cannot deny that there has always\nexisted, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a vague\nhalf-sentiment of its own existence. But this half-sentiment at no\ntime amounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do.\nAll attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more\nsceptical than before. I had been advised to study Cousin. I studied\nhim in his own works as well as in those of his European and American\nechoes. The 'Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson, for example, was placed\nin my hands. I read it with profound attention. Throughout I found it\nlogical, but the portions which were not _merely_ logical were unhappily\nthe initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. In his\nsumming up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even\nsucceeded in convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his\nbeginning, like the government of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in\nperceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own\nimmortality, he will never be so convinced by the mere abstractions\nwhich have been so long the fashion of the moralists of England, of\nFrance, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse and exercise, but take no\nhold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,\nwill always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things. The\nwill may assent--the soul--the intellect, never.\n\n \"I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually\nbelieved. But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the\nfeeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of\nreason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two. I am\nenabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.\nI cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the\nmesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of ratiocination\nwhich, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in full\naccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through\nits _effect_, into my normal condition. In sleep-waking, the reasoning\nand its conclusion--the cause and its effect--are present together. In\nmy natural state, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only\npartially, remains.\n\n \"These considerations have led me to think that some good\nresults might ensue from a series of well-directed questions\npropounded to me while mesmerized. You have often observed the profound\nself-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker--the extensive knowledge he\ndisplays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself; and\nfrom this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of\na catechism.\"\n\n I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes\nthrew Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became\nimmediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness.\nThe following conversation then ensued:--V. in the dialogue representing\nthe patient, and P. myself.\n\n_ P._ Are you asleep?\n\n_ V._ Yes--no I would rather sleep more soundly.\n\n_P._ [_After a few more passes._] Do you sleep now?\n\n_V._ Yes.\n\n_P._ How do you think your present illness will result?\n\n_V._ [_After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort_.] I must\ndie.\n\n_P._ Does the idea of death afflict you?\n\n_V._ [_Very quickly_.] No--no!\n\n_P._ Are you pleased with the prospect?\n\n_V._ If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. The\nmesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.\n\n_P._ I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.\n\n_V._ I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able\nto make. You do not question me properly.\n\n_P._ What then shall I ask?\n\n_V._ You must begin at the beginning.\n\n_P._ The beginning! but where is the beginning?\n\n_V._ You know that the beginning is GOD. [_This was said in a low,\nfluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration_.]\n\n_P._ What then is God?\n\n_V._ [_Hesitating for many minutes._] I cannot tell.\n\n_P._ Is not God spirit?\n\n_V._ While I was awake I knew what you meant by \"spirit,\" but now it\nseems only a word--such for instance as truth, beauty--a quality, I\nmean.\n\n_P._ Is not God immaterial?\n\n_V._ There is no immateriality--it is a mere word. That which is not\nmatter, is not at all--unless qualities are things.\n\n_P._ Is God, then, material?\n\n_V._ No. [_This reply startled me very much._]\n\n_P._ What then is he?\n\n_V._ [_After a long pause, and mutteringly._] I see--but it is a thing\ndifficult to tell. [_Another long pause._] He is not spirit, for\nhe exists. Nor is he matter, as _you understand it_. But there are\n_gradations_ of matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling\nthe finer, the finer pervading the grosser. The atmosphere, for example,\nimpels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates\nthe atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase in rarity\nor fineness, until we arrive at a matter _unparticled_--without\nparticles--indivisible--_one_ and here the law of impulsion and\npermeation is modified. The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not only\npermeates all things but impels all things--and thus _is_ all things\nwithin itself. This matter is God. What men attempt to embody in the\nword \"thought,\" is this matter in motion.\n\n_P._ The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion\nand thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.\n\n_V._ Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action\nof _mind_--not of _thinking_. The unparticled matter, or God, in\nquiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind. And\nthe power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human volition) is,\nin the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and omniprevalence;\n_how_ I know not, and now clearly see that I shall never know. But the\nunparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or quality, existing within\nitself, is thinking.\n\n_P._ Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the\nunparticled matter?\n\n_V._ The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in\ngradation. We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of\nwater, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous\nether. Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in\none general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas\nmore essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and that\nwhich we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach the latter, we\nfeel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, or with\nnihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception\nof its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from\nour notion of an atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness,\nsolidity, palpability, weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic\nconstitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an\nentity, or at least as matter. For want of a better word we might term\nit spirit. Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous ether--conceive a\nmatter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is more rare than\nthe metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas) at\na unique mass--an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinite\nlittleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the\nspaces between them is an absurdity. There will be a point--there will\nbe a degree of rarity, at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous,\nthe interspaces must vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But\nthe consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away, the\nnature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit. It\nis clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before. The truth is,\nit is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible to\nimagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formed\nits conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the\nconsideration of infinitely rarified matter.\n\n_P._ There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea\nof absolute coalescence;--and that is the very slight resistance\nexperienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space--a\nresistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in _some_ degree, but\nwhich is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite overlooked by\nthe sagacity even of Newton. We know that the resistance of bodies\nis, chiefly, in proportion to their density. Absolute coalescence\nis absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, there can be no\nyielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely more\neffectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant\nor of iron.\n\n_V._ Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the\nratio of its apparent unanswerability.--As regards the progress of the\nstar, it can make no difference whether the star passes through the\nether _or the ether through it_. There is no astronomical error more\nunaccountable than that which reconciles the known retardation of the\ncomets with the idea of their passage through an ether: for, however\nrare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all sidereal\nrevolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by those\nastronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found\nit impossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on\nthe other hand, about that which might be expected from the _friction_\nof the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb. In the one\ncase, the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself--in\nthe other it is endlessly accumulative.\n\n_P._ But in all this--in this identification of mere matter with God--is\nthere nothing of irreverence? [_I was forced to repeat this question\nbefore the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning_.]\n\n_V._ Can you say _why_ matter should be less reverenced than mind? But\nyou forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the\nvery \"mind\" or \"spirit\" of the schools, so far as regards its high\ncapacities, and is, moreover, the \"matter\" of these schools at the\nsame time. God, with all the powers attributed to spirit, is but the\nperfection of matter.\n\n_P._ You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is\nthought?\n\n_V._ In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal\nmind. This thought creates. All created things are but the thoughts of\nGod.\n\n_P._ You say, \"in general.\"\n\n_V._ Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, _matter_\nis necessary.\n\n_P._ But you now speak of \"mind\" and \"matter\" as do the metaphysicians.\n\n_V._ Yes--to avoid confusion. When I say \"mind,\" I mean the unparticled\nor ultimate matter; by \"matter,\" I intend all else.\n\n_P._ You were saying that \"for new individualities matter is necessary.\"\n\n_V._ Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create\nindividual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions\nof the divine mind. Thus man is individualized. Divested of corporate\ninvestiture, he were God. Now, the particular motion of the incarnated\nportions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion\nof the whole is that of God.\n\n_P._ You say that divested of the body man will be God?\n\n_V._ [_After much hesitation._] I could not have said this; it is an\nabsurdity.\n\n_P._ [_Referring to my notes._] You _did_ say that \"divested of\ncorporate investiture man were God.\"\n\n_V._ And this is true. Man thus divested _would be_ God--would be\nunindividualized. But he can never be thus divested--at least never\n_will be_--else we must imagine an action of God returning upon\nitself--a purposeless and futile action. Man is a creature. Creatures\nare thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.\n\n_P._ I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?\n\n_V._ I say that he will never be bodiless.\n\n_P._ Explain.\n\n_V._ There are two bodies--the rudimental and the complete;\ncorresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.\nWhat we call \"death,\" is but the painful metamorphosis. Our present\nincarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary. Our future is\nperfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is the full design.\n\n_P._ But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.\n\n_V._ _We_, certainly--but not the worm. The matter of which our\nrudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that\nbody; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the\nmatter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of which\nthe ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental\nsenses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in decaying, from\nthe inner form; not that inner form itself; but this inner form, as\nwell as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired the\nultimate life.\n\n_P._ You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles\ndeath. How is this?\n\n_V._ When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the\nultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental\nlife are in abeyance, and I perceive external things directly,\nwithout organs, through a medium which I shall employ in the ultimate,\nunorganized life.\n\n_P._ Unorganized?\n\n_V._ Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought\ninto sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to\nthe exclusion of other classes and forms. The organs of man are adapted\nto his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate condition,\nbeing unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all points but\none--the nature of the volition of God--that is to say, the motion of\nthe unparticled matter. You will have a distinct idea of the ultimate\nbody by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is _not_; but a\nconception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it\n_is_. A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether.\nThe vibrations generate similar ones within the retina; these again\ncommunicate similar ones to the optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar\nones to the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled\nmatter which permeates it. The motion of this latter is thought, of\nwhich perception is the first undulation. This is the mode by which the\nmind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world; and\nthis external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through the\nidiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the\nexternal world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having\naffinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention than that\nof an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and to this\nether--in unison with it--the whole body vibrates, setting in motion\nthe unparticled matter which permeates it. It is to the absence of\nidiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute the nearly\nunlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimental beings, organs\nare the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.\n\n_P._ You speak of rudimental \"beings.\" Are there other rudimental\nthinking beings than man?\n\n_V._ The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulae,\nplanets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulae, suns,\nnor planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying _pabulum_ for the\nidiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings. But for\nthe necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there\nwould have been no bodies such as these. Each of these is tenanted by a\ndistinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. In all,\nthe organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death,\nor metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate\nlife--immortality--and cognizant of all secrets but _the one_, act all\nthings and pass everywhere by mere volition:--indwelling, not the stars,\nwhich to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the accommodation\nof which we blindly deem space created--but that SPACE itself--that\ninfinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the\nstar-shadows--blotting them out as non-entities from the perception of\nthe angels.\n\n_P._ You say that \"but for the _necessity_ of the rudimental life\" there\nwould have been no stars. But why this necessity?\n\n_V._ In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter\ngenerally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple _unique_\nlaw--the Divine Volition. With the view of producing impediment, the\norganic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and law-encumbered,)\nwere contrived.\n\n_P._ But again--why need this impediment have been produced?\n\n_V._ The result of law inviolate is perfection--right--negative\nhappiness. The result of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive\npain. Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity, and\nsubstantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation of\nlaw is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable. Thus pain, which in\nthe inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.\n\n_P._ But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?\n\n_V._ All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient\nanalysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of\npain. _Positive_ pleasure is a mere idea. To be happy at any one point\nwe must have suffered at the same. Never to suffer would have been never\nto have been blessed. But it has been shown that, in the inorganic\nlife, pain cannot be thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the\nprimitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate\nlife in Heaven.\n\n_P._ Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible\nto comprehend--\"the truly _substantive_ vastness of infinity.\"\n\n_V._ This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic\nconception of the term \"_substance_\" itself. We must not regard it as a\nquality, but as a sentiment:--it is the perception, in thinking beings,\nof the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are many things\non the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants of Venus--many\nthings visible and tangible in Venus, which we could not be brought\nto appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings--to the\nangels--the whole of the unparticled matter is substance--that is\nto say, the whole of what we term \"space\" is to them the truest\nsubstantiality;--the stars, meantime, through what we consider their\nmateriality, escaping the angelic sense, just in proportion as the\nunparticled matter, through what we consider its immateriality, eludes\nthe organic.\n\n  As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone,\nI observed on his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat\nalarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once. No sooner had I done\nthis, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features, he fell\nback upon his pillow and expired. I noticed that in less than a minute\nafterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone. His brow was\nof the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, should it have appeared, only\nafter long pressure from Azrael's hand. Had the sleep-waker, indeed,\nduring the latter portion of his discourse, been addressing me from out\nthe region of the shadows?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M. VALDEMAR\n\nOF course I shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder, that\nthe extraordinary case of M. Valdemar has excited discussion. It would\nhave been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances.\nThrough the desire of all parties concerned, to keep the affair from the\npublic, at least for the present, or until we had farther opportunities\nfor investigation--through our endeavors to effect this--a garbled or\nexaggerated account made its way into society, and became the source of\nmany unpleasant misrepresentations, and, very naturally, of a great deal\nof disbelief.\n\nIt is now rendered necessary that I give the facts--as far as I\ncomprehend them myself. They are, succinctly, these:\n\nMy attention, for the last three years, had been repeatedly drawn to\nthe subject of Mesmerism; and, about nine months ago it occurred to me,\nquite suddenly, that in the series of experiments made hitherto, there\nhad been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission:--no person\nhad as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis. It remained to be seen,\nfirst, whether, in such condition, there existed in the patient any\nsusceptibility to the magnetic influence; secondly, whether, if any\nexisted, it was impaired or increased by the condition; thirdly, to what\nextent, or for how long a period, the encroachments of Death might be\narrested by the process. There were other points to be ascertained,\nbut these most excited my curiosity--the last in especial, from the\nimmensely important character of its consequences.\n\nIn looking around me for some subject by whose means I might test these\nparticulars, I was brought to think of my friend, M. Ernest Valdemar,\nthe well-known compiler of the \"Bibliotheca Forensica,\" and author\n(under the nom de plume of Issachar Marx) of the Polish versions of\n\"Wallenstein\" and \"Gargantua.\" M. Valdemar, who has resided principally\nat Harlaem, N.Y., since the year 1839, is (or was) particularly\nnoticeable for the extreme spareness of his person--his lower limbs much\nresembling those of John Randolph; and, also, for the whiteness of his\nwhiskers, in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair--the latter,\nin consequence, being very generally mistaken for a wig. His temperament\nwas markedly nervous, and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric\nexperiment. On two or three occasions I had put him to sleep with little\ndifficulty, but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar\nconstitution had naturally led me to anticipate. His will was at no\nperiod positively, or thoroughly, under my control, and in regard to\nclairvoyance, I could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon. I\nalways attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of\nhis health. For some months previous to my becoming acquainted with\nhim, his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis. It was his\ncustom, indeed, to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution, as of a\nmatter neither to be avoided nor regretted.\n\nWhen the ideas to which I have alluded first occurred to me, it was\nof course very natural that I should think of M. Valdemar. I knew the\nsteady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples\nfrom him; and he had no relatives in America who would be likely to\ninterfere. I spoke to him frankly upon the subject; and, to my surprise,\nhis interest seemed vividly excited. I say to my surprise, for, although\nhe had always yielded his person freely to my experiments, he had never\nbefore given me any tokens of sympathy with what I did. His disease was\nof that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect\nto the epoch of its termination in death; and it was finally arranged\nbetween us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the\nperiod announced by his physicians as that of his decease.\n\nIt is now rather more than seven months since I received, from M.\nValdemar himself, the subjoined note:\n\nMy DEAR P---,\n\nYou may as well come now. D---- and F---- are agreed that I cannot hold out\nbeyond to-morrow midnight; and I think they have hit the time very\nnearly.\n\nVALDEMAR\n\nI received this note within half an hour after it was written, and in\nfifteen minutes more I was in the dying man's chamber. I had not seen\nhim for ten days, and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the\nbrief interval had wrought in him. His face wore a leaden hue; the eyes\nwere utterly lustreless; and the emaciation was so extreme that the\nskin had been broken through by the cheek-bones. His expectoration was\nexcessive. The pulse was barely perceptible. He retained, nevertheless,\nin a very remarkable manner, both his mental power and a certain degree\nof physical strength. He spoke with distinctness--took some palliative\nmedicines without aid--and, when I entered the room, was occupied in\npenciling memoranda in a pocket-book. He was propped up in the bed by\npillows. Doctors D---- and F---- were in attendance.\n\nAfter pressing Valdemar's hand, I took these gentlemen aside, and\nobtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition. The left\nlung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous\nstate, and was, of course, entirely useless for all purposes of\nvitality. The right, in its upper portion, was also partially, if\nnot thoroughly, ossified, while the lower region was merely a mass\nof purulent tubercles, running one into another. Several extensive\nperforations existed; and, at one point, permanent adhesion to the\nribs had taken place. These appearances in the right lobe were of\ncomparatively recent date. The ossification had proceeded with very\nunusual rapidity; no sign of it had been discovered a month before, and\nthe adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days.\nIndependently of the phthisis, the patient was suspected of aneurism\nof the aorta; but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact\ndiagnosis impossible. It was the opinion of both physicians that M.\nValdemar would die about midnight on the morrow (Sunday). It was then\nseven o'clock on Saturday evening.\n\nOn quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself,\nDoctors D---- and F---- had bidden him a final farewell. It had not been their\nintention to return; but, at my request, they agreed to look in upon the\npatient about ten the next night.\n\nWhen they had gone, I spoke freely with M. Valdemar on the subject\nof his approaching dissolution, as well as, more particularly, of the\nexperiment proposed. He still professed himself quite willing and even\nanxious to have it made, and urged me to commence it at once. A male and\na female nurse were in attendance; but I did not feel myself altogether\nat liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable\nwitnesses than these people, in case of sudden accident, might prove.\nI therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night, when\nthe arrival of a medical student with whom I had some acquaintance, (Mr.\nTheodore L--l,) relieved me from farther embarrassment. It had been my\ndesign, originally, to wait for the physicians; but I was induced to\nproceed, first, by the urgent entreaties of M. Valdemar, and secondly,\nby my conviction that I had not a moment to lose, as he was evidently\nsinking fast.\n\nMr. L--l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes\nof all that occurred, and it is from his memoranda that what I now have\nto relate is, for the most part, either condensed or copied verbatim.\n\nIt wanted about five minutes of eight when, taking the patient's hand, I\nbegged him to state, as distinctly as he could, to Mr. L--l, whether he\n(M. Valdemar) was entirely willing that I should make the experiment of\nmesmerizing him in his then condition.\n\nHe replied feebly, yet quite audibly, \"Yes, I wish to be. I fear you\nhave mesmerized\"--adding immediately afterwards, \"deferred it too long.\"\n\nWhile he spoke thus, I commenced the passes which I had already found\nmost effectual in subduing him. He was evidently influenced with the\nfirst lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead; but although I\nexerted all my powers, no further perceptible effect was induced\nuntil some minutes after ten o'clock, when Doctors D-- and F-- called,\naccording to appointment. I explained to them, in a few words, what I\ndesigned, and as they opposed no objection, saying that the patient was\nalready in the death agony, I proceeded without hesitation--exchanging,\nhowever, the lateral passes for downward ones, and directing my gaze\nentirely into the right eye of the sufferer.\n\nBy this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was\nstertorous, and at intervals of half a minute.\n\nThis condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour. At the\nexpiration of this period, however, a natural although a very deep\nsigh escaped the bosom of the dying man, and the stertorous breathing\nceased--that is to say, its stertorousness was no longer apparent; the\nintervals were undiminished. The patient's extremities were of an icy\ncoldness.\n\nAt five minutes before eleven I perceived unequivocal signs of the\nmesmeric influence. The glassy roll of the eye was changed for that\nexpression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in\ncases of sleep-waking, and which it is quite impossible to mistake.\nWith a few rapid lateral passes I made the lids quiver, as in incipient\nsleep, and with a few more I closed them altogether. I was not\nsatisfied, however, with this, but continued the manipulations\nvigorously, and with the fullest exertion of the will, until I had\ncompletely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer, after placing them in\na seemingly easy position. The legs were at full length; the arms were\nnearly so, and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin.\nThe head was very slightly elevated.\n\nWhen I had accomplished this, it was fully midnight, and I requested\nthe gentlemen present to examine M. Valdemar's condition. After a few\nexperiments, they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of\nmesmeric trance. The curiosity of both the physicians was greatly\nexcited. Dr. D---- resolved at once to remain with the patient all\nnight, while Dr. F---- took leave with a promise to return at daybreak.\nMr. L--l and the nurses remained.\n\nWe left M. Valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in\nthe morning, when I approached him and found him in precisely the same\ncondition as when Dr. F--went away--that is to say, he lay in the\nsame position; the pulse was imperceptible; the breathing was gentle\n(scarcely noticeable, unless through the application of a mirror to the\nlips); the eyes were closed naturally; and the limbs were as rigid and\nas cold as marble. Still, the general appearance was certainly not that\nof death.\n\nAs I approached M. Valdemar I made a kind of half effort to influence\nhis right arm into pursuit of my own, as I passed the latter gently\nto and fro above his person. In such experiments with this patient had\nnever perfectly succeeded before, and assuredly I had little thought of\nsucceeding now; but to my astonishment, his arm very readily, although\nfeebly, followed every direction I assigned it with mine. I determined\nto hazard a few words of conversation.\n\n\"M. Valdemar,\" I said, \"are you asleep?\" He made no answer, but I\nperceived a tremor about the lips, and was thus induced to repeat the\nquestion, again and again. At its third repetition, his whole frame was\nagitated by a very slight shivering; the eyelids unclosed themselves so\nfar as to display a white line of the ball; the lips moved sluggishly,\nand from between them, in a barely audible whisper, issued the words:\n\n\"Yes;--asleep now. Do not wake me!--let me die so!\"\n\nI here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever. The right arm,\nas before, obeyed the direction of my hand. I questioned the sleep-waker\nagain:\n\n\"Do you still feel pain in the breast, M. Valdemar?\"\n\nThe answer now was immediate, but even less audible than before: \"No\npain--I am dying.\"\n\nI did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then, and\nnothing more was said or done until the arrival of Dr. F--, who came a\nlittle before sunrise, and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding\nthe patient still alive. After feeling the pulse and applying a mirror\nto the lips, he requested me to speak to the sleep-waker again. I did\nso, saying:\n\n\"M. Valdemar, do you still sleep?\"\n\nAs before, some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made; and during the\ninterval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak.\nAt my fourth repetition of the question, he said very faintly, almost\ninaudibly:\n\n\"Yes; still asleep--dying.\"\n\nIt was now the opinion, or rather the wish, of the physicians, that\nM. Valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present\napparently tranquil condition, until death should supervene--and this,\nit was generally agreed, must now take place within a few minutes. I\nconcluded, however, to speak to him once more, and merely repeated my\nprevious question.\n\nWhile I spoke, there came a marked change over the countenance of\nthe sleep-waker. The eyes rolled themselves slowly open, the pupils\ndisappearing upwardly; the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hue,\nresembling not so much parchment as white paper; and the circular hectic\nspots which, hitherto, had been strongly defined in the centre of each\ncheek, went out at once. I use this expression, because the\nsuddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the\nextinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath. The upper lip,\nat the same time, writhed itself away from the teeth, which it had\npreviously covered completely; while the lower jaw fell with an audible\njerk, leaving the mouth widely extended, and disclosing in full view the\nswollen and blackened tongue. I presume that no member of the party\nthen present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors; but so hideous\nbeyond conception was the appearance of M. Valdemar at this moment, that\nthere was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed.\n\nI now feel that I have reached a point of this narrative at which every\nreader will be startled into positive disbelief. It is my business,\nhowever, simply to proceed.\n\nThere was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in M. Valdemar; and\nconcluding him to be dead, we were consigning him to the charge of the\nnurses, when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue.\nThis continued for perhaps a minute. At the expiration of this period,\nthere issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice--such as it\nwould be madness in me to attempt describing. There are, indeed, two or\nthree epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part; I\nmight say, for example, that the sound was harsh, and broken and hollow;\nbut the hideous whole is indescribable, for the simple reason that no\nsimilar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity. There were two\nparticulars, nevertheless, which I thought then, and still think, might\nfairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation--as well adapted to\nconvey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity. In the first place, the\nvoice seemed to reach our ears--at least mine--from a vast distance,\nor from some deep cavern within the earth. In the second place, it\nimpressed me (I fear, indeed, that it will be impossible to make myself\ncomprehended) as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of\ntouch.\n\nI have spoken both of \"sound\" and of \"voice.\" I mean to say that\nthe sound was one of distinct--of even wonderfully, thrillingly\ndistinct--syllabification. M. Valdemar spoke--obviously in reply to the\nquestion I had propounded to him a few minutes before. I had asked him,\nit will be remembered, if he still slept. He now said:\n\n\"Yes;--no;--I have been sleeping--and now--now--I am dead.\"\n\nNo person present even affected to deny, or attempted to repress, the\nunutterable, shuddering horror which these few words, thus uttered, were\nso well calculated to convey. Mr. L--l (the student) swooned. The nurses\nimmediately left the chamber, and could not be induced to return. My own\nimpressions I would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader.\nFor nearly an hour, we busied ourselves, silently--without the utterance\nof a word--in endeavors to revive Mr. L--l. When he came to himself,\nwe addressed ourselves again to an investigation of M. Valdemar's\ncondition.\n\nIt remained in all respects as I have last described it, with the\nexception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration. An\nattempt to draw blood from the arm failed. I should mention, too, that\nthis limb was no farther subject to my will. I endeavored in vain to\nmake it follow the direction of my hand. The only real indication,\nindeed, of the mesmeric influence, was now found in the vibratory\nmovement of the tongue, whenever I addressed M. Valdemar a question.\nHe seemed to be making an effort to reply, but had no longer sufficient\nvolition. To queries put to him by any other person than myself he\nseemed utterly insensible--although I endeavored to place each member\nof the company in mesmeric rapport with him. I believe that I have now\nrelated all that is necessary to an understanding of the sleep-waker's\nstate at this epoch. Other nurses were procured; and at ten o'clock I\nleft the house in company with the two physicians and Mr. L--l.\n\nIn the afternoon we all called again to see the patient. His condition\nremained precisely the same. We had now some discussion as to the\npropriety and feasibility of awakening him; but we had little difficulty\nin agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing. It was\nevident that, so far, death (or what is usually termed death) had been\narrested by the mesmeric process. It seemed clear to us all that to\nawaken M. Valdemar would be merely to insure his instant, or at least\nhis speedy dissolution.\n\nFrom this period until the close of last week--an interval of nearly\nseven months--we continued to make daily calls at M. Valdemar's house,\naccompanied, now and then, by medical and other friends. All this time\nthe sleeper-waker remained exactly as I have last described him. The\nnurses' attentions were continual.\n\nIt was on Friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment\nof awakening or attempting to awaken him; and it is the (perhaps)\nunfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to\nso much discussion in private circles--to so much of what I cannot help\nthinking unwarranted popular feeling.\n\nFor the purpose of relieving M. Valdemar from the mesmeric trance, I\nmade use of the customary passes. These, for a time, were unsuccessful.\nThe first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the\niris. It was observed, as especially remarkable, that this lowering\nof the pupil was accompanied by the profuse out-flowing of a yellowish\nichor (from beneath the lids) of a pungent and highly offensive odor.\n\nIt was now suggested that I should attempt to influence the patient's\narm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimated\na desire to have me put a question. I did so, as follows:\n\n\"M. Valdemar, can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes\nnow?\"\n\nThere was an instant return of the hectic circles on the cheeks; the\ntongue quivered, or rather rolled violently in the mouth (although the\njaws and lips remained rigid as before;) and at length the same hideous\nvoice which I have already described, broke forth:\n\n\"For God's sake!--quick!--quick!--put me to sleep--or, quick!--waken\nme!--quick!--I say to you that I am dead!\"\n\nI was thoroughly unnerved, and for an instant remained undecided what to\ndo. At first I made an endeavor to re-compose the patient; but, failing\nin this through total abeyance of the will, I retraced my steps and as\nearnestly struggled to awaken him. In this attempt I soon saw that I\nshould be successful--or at least I soon fancied that my success would\nbe complete--and I am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the\npatient awaken.\n\nFor what really occurred, however, it is quite impossible that any human\nbeing could have been prepared.\n\nAs I rapidly made the mesmeric passes, amid ejaculations of \"dead!\ndead!\" absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the\nsufferer, his whole frame at once--within the space of a single minute,\nor even less, shrunk--crumbled--absolutely rotted away beneath my hands.\nUpon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass\nof loathsome--of detestable putridity.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK CAT.\n\nFOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, I\nneither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,\nin a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I\nnot--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day\nI would unburthen my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before\nthe world, plainly, succinctly, and without comment, a series of\nmere household events. In their consequences, these events have\nterrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to\nexpound them. To me, they have presented little but Horror--to many\nthey will seem less terrible than _barroques_. Hereafter, perhaps,\nsome intellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to the\ncommon-place--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far less\nexcitable than my own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I\ndetail with awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very\nnatural causes and effects.\n\nFrom my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my\ndisposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make\nme the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was\nindulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent\nmost of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing\nthem. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my\nmanhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To\nthose who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious\ndog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the\nintensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the\nunselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly\nto the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry\nfriendship and gossamer fidelity of mere _Man_.\n\nI married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not\nuncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she\nlost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We\nhad birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and _a cat_.\n\nThis latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,\nand sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,\nmy wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition,\nmade frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all\nblack cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever _serious_ upon\nthis point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than\nthat it happens, just now, to be remembered.\n\nPluto--this was the cat's name--was my favorite pet and playmate. I\nalone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It\nwas even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me\nthrough the streets.\n\nOur friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during which\nmy general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of the\nFiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radical\nalteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more\nirritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myself\nto use intemperate language to my wife. At length, I even offered her\npersonal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change\nin my disposition. I not only neglected, but ill-used them. For\nPluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from\nmaltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the\nmonkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they\ncame in my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is like\nAlcohol!--and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and\nconsequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience the\neffects of my ill temper.\n\nOne night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my haunts about\ntown, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him; when, in\nhis fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with\nhis teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself\nno longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my\nbody and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every\nfibre of my frame. I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened\nit, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of\nits eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the\ndamnable atrocity.\n\nWhen reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes of\nthe night's debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half of\nremorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,\na feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I again\nplunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.\n\nIn the meantime the cat slowly recovered. The socket of the lost eye\npresented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer appeared\nto suffer any pain. He went about the house as usual, but, as might be\nexpected, fled in extreme terror at my approach. I had so much of my\nold heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on\nthe part of a creature which had once so loved me. But this feeling\nsoon gave place to irritation. And then came, as if to my final and\nirrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS. Of this spirit\nphilosophy takes no account. Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives,\nthan I am that perverseness is one of the primitive impulses of the\nhuman heart--one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments,\nwhich give direction to the character of Man. Who has not, a hundred\ntimes, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, for no other\nreason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual\ninclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, to violate that which\nis _Law_, merely because we understand it to be such? This spirit\nof perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was this\nunfathomable longing of the soul _to vex itself_--to offer violence to\nits own nature--to do wrong for the wrong's sake only--that urged me to\ncontinue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the\nunoffending brute. One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about\nits neck and hung it to the limb of a tree;--hung it with the\ntears streaming from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my\nheart;--hung it _because_ I knew that it had loved me, and _because_\nI felt it had given me no reason of offence;--hung it _because_ I knew\nthat in so doing I was committing a sin--a deadly sin that would\nso jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it--if such a thing wore\npossible--even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most\nMerciful and Most Terrible God.\n\nOn the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was aroused\nfrom sleep by the cry of fire. The curtains of my bed were in flames.\nThe whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,\na servant, and myself, made our escape from the conflagration. The\ndestruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and\nI resigned myself thenceforward to despair.\n\nI am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause\nand effect, between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a\nchain of facts--and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect.\nOn the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins. The walls, with\none exception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartment\nwall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, and\nagainst which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here,\nin great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which I\nattributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a\ndense crowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a\nparticular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The\nwords \"strange!\" \"singular!\" and other similar expressions, excited my\ncuriosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in _bas relief_ upon the\nwhite surface, the figure of a gigantic _cat_. The impression was given\nwith an accuracy truly marvellous. There was a rope about the animal's\nneck.\n\nWhen I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it as\nless--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflection\ncame to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden\nadjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire, this garden had been\nimmediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal must\nhave been cut from the tree and thrown, through an open window, into my\nchamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me\nfrom sleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my\ncruelty into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of\nwhich, with the flames, and the _ammonia_ from the carcass, had then\naccomplished the portraiture as I saw it.\n\nAlthough I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to my\nconscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the less\nfail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid\nmyself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came\nback into my spirit a half-sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse.\nI went so far as to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me,\namong the vile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet\nof the same species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to\nsupply its place.\n\nOne night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy, my\nattention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon\nthe head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum, which\nconstituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been looking\nsteadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what now\ncaused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived the\nobject thereupon. I approached it, and touched it with my hand. It was\na black cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closely\nresembling him in every respect but one. Pluto had not a white hair upon\nany portion of his body; but this cat had a large, although indefinite\nsplotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. Upon\nmy touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed against my\nhand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was the very\ncreature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase it\nof the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing of\nit--had never seen it before.\n\nI continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the animal\nevinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so;\noccasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached\nthe house it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a great\nfavorite with my wife.\n\nFor my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. This\nwas just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not how\nor why it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and\nannoyed. By slow degrees, these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose\ninto the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense\nof shame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing\nme from physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, or\notherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I came\nto look upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its\nodious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.\n\nWhat added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, on\nthe morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had been\ndeprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared\nit to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,\nthat humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,\nand the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.\n\nWith my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemed\nto increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would\nbe difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat, it would\ncrouch beneath my chair, or spring upon my knees, covering me with its\nloathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet and\nthus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my\ndress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although\nI longed to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,\npartly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it at\nonce--by absolute dread of the beast.\n\nThis dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should be\nat a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,\neven in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terror\nand horror with which the animal inspired me, had been heightened by one\nof the merest chimaeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had\ncalled my attention, more than once, to the character of the mark of\nwhite hair, of which I have spoken, and which constituted the sole\nvisible difference between the strange beast and the one I had\ndestroyed. The reader will remember that this mark, although large, had\nbeen originally very indefinite; but, by slow degrees--degrees nearly\nimperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason struggled to reject\nas fanciful--it had, at length, assumed a rigorous distinctness of\noutline. It was now the representation of an object that I shudder to\nname--and for this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have\nrid myself of the monster _had I dared_--it was now, I say, the image\nof a hideous--of a ghastly thing--of the GALLOWS!--oh, mournful and\nterrible engine of Horror and of Crime--of Agony and of Death!\n\nAnd now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere Humanity.\nAnd _a brute beast _--whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--_a\nbrute beast_ to work out for _me_--for me a man, fashioned in the image\nof the High God--so much of insufferable wo! Alas! neither by day nor\nby night knew I the blessing of Rest any more! During the former the\ncreature left me no moment alone; and, in the latter, I started, hourly,\nfrom dreams of unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of _the thing_\nupon my face, and its vast weight--an incarnate Night-Mare that I had no\npower to shake off--incumbent eternally upon my _heart!_\n\nBeneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant\nof the good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my sole\nintimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of\nmy usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;\nwhile, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable outbursts of a fury\nto which I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas!\nwas the most usual and the most patient of sufferers.\n\nOne day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into the cellar\nof the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The cat\nfollowed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,\nexasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my\nwrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed a\nblow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatal\nhad it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand of\nmy wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,\nI withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain. She\nfell dead upon the spot, without a groan.\n\nThis hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and with\nentire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that I\ncould not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, without\nthe risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered\nmy mind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute\nfragments, and destroying them by fire. At another, I resolved to dig\na grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated about\ncasting it in the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as if\nmerchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to\ntake it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a far\nbetter expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in the\ncellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up\ntheir victims.\n\nFor a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were\nloosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with a\nrough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from\nhardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by\na false chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made to\nresemble the red of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readily\ndisplace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole\nup as before, so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious. And in\nthis calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crow-bar I easily\ndislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the body against\nthe inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, with little\ntrouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally stood. Having\nprocured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible precaution, I\nprepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, and\nwith this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I had\nfinished, I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present\nthe slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on\nthe floor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around\ntriumphantly, and said to myself--\"Here at least, then, my labor has not\nbeen in vain.\"\n\nMy next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so\nmuch wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to put it to\ndeath. Had I been able to meet with it, at the moment, there could have\nbeen no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal had\nbeen alarmed at the violence of my previous anger, and forebore to\npresent itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe, or to\nimagine, the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the\ndetested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its\nappearance during the night--and thus for one night at least, since its\nintroduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, slept\neven with the burden of murder upon my soul!\n\nThe second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.\nOnce again I breathed as a freeman. The monster, in terror, had fled the\npremises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness was supreme!\nThe guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few inquiries\nhad been made, but these had been readily answered. Even a search had\nbeen instituted--but of course nothing was to be discovered. I looked\nupon my future felicity as secured.\n\nUpon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police came,\nvery unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to make rigorous\ninvestigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of\nmy place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officers\nbade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or corner\nunexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended into\nthe cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat calmly as that of\none who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. I\nfolded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. The police\nwere thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart\nwas too strong to be restrained. I burned to say if but one word, by\nway of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my\nguiltlessness.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, \"I delight\nto have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health, and a little\nmore courtesy. By the bye, gentlemen, this--this is a very well\nconstructed house.\" [In the rabid desire to say something easily, I\nscarcely knew what I uttered at all.]--\"I may say an _excellently_ well\nconstructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these walls\nare solidly put together;\" and here, through the mere phrenzy of\nbravado, I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon\nthat very portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the\nwife of my bosom.\n\nBut may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch-Fiend! No\nsooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence, than I was\nanswered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffled\nand broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling into\none long, loud, and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--a\nhowl--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as\nmight have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the\ndammed in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.\n\nOf my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to\nthe opposite wall. For one instant the party upon the stairs remained\nmotionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next, a dozen\nstout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, already\ngreatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of\nthe spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and solitary eye\nof fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,\nand whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled\nthe monster up within the tomb!\n\n\n\n\nTHE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER\n\n     Son coeur est un luth suspendu;\n     Sitot qu'on le touche il resonne..\n\n                             _  De Beranger_.\n\nDURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the\nyear, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had\nbeen passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of\ncountry; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew\non, within view of the melancholy House of Usher. I know not how\nit was--but, with the first glimpse of the building, a sense of\ninsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit. I say insufferable; for the\nfeeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable, because poetic,\nsentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternest\nnatural images of the desolate or terrible. I looked upon the scene\nbefore me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscape features of the\ndomain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacant eye-like windows--upon a\nfew rank sedges--and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees--with an\nutter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation\nmore properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium--the\nbitter lapse into everyday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.\nThere was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemed\ndreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture\ninto aught of the sublime. What was it--I paused to think--what was it\nthat so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher? It was a\nmystery all insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that\ncrowded upon me as I pondered. I was forced to fall back upon the\nunsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there _are_\ncombinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus\naffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations\nbeyond our depth. It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different\narrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the\npicture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its\ncapacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined\nmy horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in\nunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with a shudder\neven more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled and inverted images\nof the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant and\neye-like windows.\n\nNevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a\nsojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of\nmy boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last\nmeeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of\nthe country--a letter from him--which, in its wildly importunate nature,\nhad admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of\nnervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mental\ndisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me, as his\nbest, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by\nthe cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It\nwas the manner in which all this, and much more, was said--it was the\napparent _heart_ that went with his request--which allowed me no\nroom for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still\nconsidered a very singular summons.\n\nAlthough, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really\nknew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and\nhabitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been\nnoted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament,\ndisplaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and\nmanifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive\ncharity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps\neven more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of\nmusical science. I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the\nstem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no\nperiod, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay\nin the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and\nvery temporary variation, so lain. It was this deficiency, I considered,\nwhile running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of\nthe premises with the accredited character of the people, and while\nspeculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long\nlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it was this\ndeficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent undeviating\ntransmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with the name, which\nhad, at length, so identified the two as to merge the original title\nof the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the \"House\nof Usher\"--an appellation which seemed to include, in the minds of the\npeasantry who used it, both the family and the family mansion.\n\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish\nexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been to deepen the\nfirst singular impression. There can be no doubt that the consciousness\nof the rapid increase of my superstition--for why should I not so term\nit?--served mainly to accelerate the increase itself. Such, I have\nlong known, is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a\nbasis. And it might have been for this reason only, that, when I again\nuplifted my eyes to the house itself, from its image in the pool, there\ngrew in my mind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I\nbut mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed\nme. I had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that\nabout the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar\nto themselves and their immediate vicinity--an atmosphere which had\nno affinity with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the\ndecayed trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn--a pestilent and\nmystic vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.\n\nShaking off from my spirit what _must_ have been a dream, I scanned more\nnarrowly the real aspect of the building. Its principal feature seemed\nto be that of an excessive antiquity. The discoloration of ages had been\ngreat. Minute fungi overspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine\ntangled web-work from the eaves. Yet all this was apart from any\nextraordinary dilapidation. No portion of the masonry had fallen; and\nthere appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect\nadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of the individual\nstones. In this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality\nof old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected\nvault, with no disturbance from the breath of the external air. Beyond\nthis indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little\ntoken of instability. Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might\nhave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the\nroof of the building in front, made its way down the wall in a zigzag\ndirection, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.\n\nNoticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house. A\nservant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic archway of\nthe hall. A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence,\nthrough many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the _studio_\nof his master. Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know\nnot how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already\nspoken. While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,\nthe sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebon blackness of the floors,\nand the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode, were\nbut matters to which, or to such as which, I had been accustomed from my\ninfancy--while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all\nthis--I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which\nordinary images were stirring up. On one of the staircases, I met the\nphysician of the family. His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled\nexpression of low cunning and perplexity. He accosted me with\ntrepidation and passed on. The valet now threw open a door and ushered\nme into the presence of his master.\n\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty. The windows\nwere long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a distance from the black\noaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams\nof encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes,\nand served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects\naround; the eye, however, struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles\nof the chamber, or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.\nDark draperies hung upon the walls. The general furniture was profuse,\ncomfortless, antique, and tattered. Many books and musical instruments\nlay scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene. I\nfelt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow. An air of stern, deep, and\nirredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.\n\nUpon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at\nfull length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in\nit, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality--of the constrained\neffort of the _ennuye_ man of the world. A glance, however, at his\ncountenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for\nsome moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half\nof pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,\nin so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that\nI could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me\nwith the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face\nhad been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye\nlarge, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and\nvery pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a\ndelicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar\nformations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,\nof a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness and\ntenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions\nof the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be\nforgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character\nof these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay\nso much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor\nof the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things\nstartled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to\ngrow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated\nrather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect\nits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.\n\nIn the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence--an\ninconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a series of feeble\nand futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancy--an excessive\nnervous agitation. For something of this nature I had indeed been\nprepared, no less by his letter, than by reminiscences of certain\nboyish traits, and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical\nconformation and temperament. His action was alternately vivacious and\nsullen. His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision (when the\nanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) to that species of energetic\nconcision--that abrupt, weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding\nenunciation--that leaden, self-balanced and perfectly modulated\nguttural utterance, which may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the\nirreclaimable eater of opium, during the periods of his most intense\nexcitement.\n\nIt was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest\ndesire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him. He\nentered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of his\nmalady. It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one\nfor which he despaired to find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he\nimmediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off. It displayed\nitself in a host of unnatural sensations. Some of these, as he detailed\nthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms, and\nthe general manner of the narration had their weight. He suffered much\nfrom a morbid acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone\nendurable; he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors\nof all flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint\nlight; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed\ninstruments, which did not inspire him with horror.\n\nTo an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave. \"I shall\nperish,\" said he, \"I must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus,\nand not otherwise, shall I be lost. I dread the events of the future,\nnot in themselves, but in their results. I shudder at the thought\nof any, even the most trivial, incident, which may operate upon this\nintolerable agitation of soul. I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,\nexcept in its absolute effect--in terror. In this unnerved--in this\npitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner or later arrive\nwhen I must abandon life and reason together, in some struggle with the\ngrim phantasm, FEAR.\"\n\nI learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal\nhints, another singular feature of his mental condition. He was\nenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling\nwhich he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had never ventured\nforth--in regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed\nin terms too shadowy here to be re-stated--an influence which some\npeculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion, had,\nby dint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--an effect\nwhich the _physique_ of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn\ninto which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the\n_morale_ of his existence.\n\nHe admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the\npeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more\nnatural and far more palpable origin--to the severe and long-continued\nillness--indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution--of a tenderly\nbeloved sister--his sole companion for long years--his last and only\nrelative on earth. \"Her decease,\" he said, with a bitterness which I can\nnever forget, \"would leave him (him the hopeless and the frail) the last\nof the ancient race of the Ushers.\" While he spoke, the lady Madeline\n(for so was she called) passed slowly through a remote portion of the\napartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared. I\nregarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread--and\nyet I found it impossible to account for such feelings. A sensation of\nstupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps. When a\ndoor, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought instinctively and\neagerly the countenance of the brother--but he had buried his face\nin his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary\nwanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many\npassionate tears.\n\nThe disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her\nphysicians. A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the person,\nand frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical\ncharacter, were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto she had steadily borne\nup against the pressure of her malady, and had not betaken herself\nfinally to bed; but, on the closing in of the evening of my arrival\nat the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at night with\ninexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer;\nand I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thus\nprobably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at least while\nliving, would be seen by me no more.\n\nFor several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or\nmyself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavors to\nalleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or\nI listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking\nguitar. And thus, as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more\nunreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did\nI perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which\ndarkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all\nobjects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation\nof gloom.\n\nI shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus\nspent alone with the master of the House of Usher. Yet I should fail in\nany attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies,\nor of the occupations, in which he involved me, or led me the way. An\nexcited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over\nall. His long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears. Among\nother things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and\namplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber. From the\npaintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch\nby touch, into vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly,\nbecause I shuddered knowing not why;--from these paintings (vivid as\ntheir images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more\nthan a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely\nwritten words. By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs,\nhe arrested and overawed attention. If ever mortal painted an idea, that\nmortal was Roderick Usher. For me at least--in the circumstances then\nsurrounding me--there arose out of the pure abstractions which the\nhypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an intensity of\nintolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in the contemplation\nof the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of Fuseli.\n\nOne of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking not so\nrigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth, although\nfeebly, in words. A small picture presented the interior of an immensely\nlong and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and\nwithout interruption or device. Certain accessory points of the design\nserved well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding\ndepth below the surface of the earth. No outlet was observed in any\nportion of its vast extent, and no torch, or other artificial source of\nlight was discernible; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout,\nand bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor.\n\nI have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which\nrendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the exception of\ncertain effects of stringed instruments. It was, perhaps, the narrow\nlimits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar, which gave\nbirth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his performances.\nBut the fervid _facility_ of his _impromptus_ could not be so accounted\nfor. They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in the\nwords of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompanied himself\nwith rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of that intense mental\ncollectedness and concentration to which I have previously alluded\nas observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial\nexcitement. The words of one of these rhapsodies I have easily\nremembered. I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it, as\nhe gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of its meaning, I\nfancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness\non the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her\nthrone. The verses, which were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very\nnearly, if not accurately, thus:\n\n                         I.\n     In the greenest of our valleys,\n         By good angels tenanted,\n     Once a fair and stately palace--\n         Radiant palace--reared its head.\n     In the monarch Thought's dominion--\n         It stood there!\n     Never seraph spread a pinion\n         Over fabric half so fair.\n                         II.\n     Banners yellow, glorious, golden,\n         On its roof did float and flow;\n     (This--all this--was in the olden\n         Time long ago)\n     And every gentle air that dallied,\n         In that sweet day,\n     Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,\n         A winged odor went away.\n                         III.\n     Wanderers in that happy valley\n         Through two luminous windows saw\n     Spirits moving musically\n         To a lute's well-tuned law,\n     Round about a throne, where sitting\n         (Porphyrogene!)\n     In state his glory well befitting,\n         The ruler of the realm was seen.\n                          IV.\n     And all with pearl and ruby glowing\n         Was the fair palace door,\n     Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\n         And sparkling evermore,\n     A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty\n         Was but to sing,\n     In voices of surpassing beauty,\n         The wit and wisdom of their king.\n                         V.\n     But evil things, in robes of sorrow,\n         Assailed the monarch's high estate;\n     (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow\n         Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)\n     And, round about his home, the glory\n         That blushed and bloomed\n     Is but a dim-remembered story\n         Of the old time entombed.\n                         VI.\n     And travellers now within that valley,\n         Through the red-litten windows, see\n     Vast forms that move fantastically\n         To a discordant melody;\n     While, like a rapid ghastly river,\n         Through the pale door,\n     A hideous throng rush out forever,\n         And laugh--but smile no more.\n\nI well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led us into\na train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of Usher's\nwhich I mention not so much on account of its novelty, (for other men\n* have thought thus,) as on account of the pertinacity with which\nhe maintained it. This opinion, in its general form, was that of the\nsentience of all vegetable things. But, in his disordered fancy, the\nidea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain\nconditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization. I lack words to express\nthe full extent, or the earnest _abandon_ of his persuasion. The belief,\nhowever, was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray\nstones of the home of his forefathers. The conditions of the sentience\nhad been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation of\nthese stones--in the order of their arrangement, as well as in that of\nthe many _fungi_ which overspread them, and of the decayed trees which\nstood around--above all, in the long undisturbed endurance of this\narrangement, and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.\nIts evidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he\nsaid, (and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certain\ncondensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the\nwalls. The result was discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet\nimportunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the\ndestinies of his family, and which made _him_ what I now saw him--what\nhe was. Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.\n\n* Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of\nLandaff.--See \"Chemical Essays,\" vol v.\n\nOur books--the books which, for years, had formed no small portion of\nthe mental existence of the invalid--were, as might be supposed, in\nstrict keeping with this character of phantasm. We pored together over\nsuch works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of Gresset; the Belphegor of\nMachiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage\nof Nicholas Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean\nD'Indagine, and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of\nTieck; and the City of the Sun of Campanella. One favorite volume was\na small octavo edition of the _Directorium Inquisitorium_, by the\nDominican Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,\nabout the old African Satyrs and OEgipans, over which Usher would sit\ndreaming for hours. His chief delight, however, was found in the perusal\nof an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual of\na forgotten church--the _Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae\nMaguntinae_.\n\nI could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its\nprobable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening, having\ninformed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he stated his\nintention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight, (previously to its\nfinal interment,) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls\nof the building. The worldly reason, however, assigned for this singular\nproceeding, was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute. The\nbrother had been led to his resolution (so he told me) by consideration\nof the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, of certain\nobtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men, and of the\nremote and exposed situation of the burial-ground of the family. I will\nnot deny that when I called to mind the sinister countenance of the\nperson whom I met upon the staircase, on the day of my arrival at\nthe house, I had no desire to oppose what I regarded as at best but a\nharmless, and by no means an unnatural, precaution.\n\nAt the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements for\nthe temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined, we two alone\nbore it to its rest. The vault in which we placed it (and which had\nbeen so long unopened that our torches, half smothered in its oppressive\natmosphere, gave us little opportunity for investigation) was small,\ndamp, and entirely without means of admission for light; lying, at great\ndepth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my\nown sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote feudal\ntimes, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later days, as a\nplace of deposit for powder, or some other highly combustible substance,\nas a portion of its floor, and the whole interior of a long archway\nthrough which we reached it, were carefully sheathed with copper. The\ndoor, of massive iron, had been, also, similarly protected. Its immense\nweight caused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its\nhinges.\n\nHaving deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of\nhorror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin,\nand looked upon the face of the tenant. A striking similitude between\nthe brother and sister now first arrested my attention; and Usher,\ndivining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out some few words from which\nI learned that the deceased and himself had been twins, and that\nsympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between\nthem. Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we could\nnot regard her unawed. The disease which had thus entombed the lady in\nthe maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladies of a strictly\ncataleptical character, the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and\nthe face, and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is\nso terrible in death. We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having\nsecured the door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely\nless gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house.\n\nAnd now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable change\ncame over the features of the mental disorder of my friend. His\nordinary manner had vanished. His ordinary occupations were neglected or\nforgotten. He roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried, unequal, and\nobjectless step. The pallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible,\na more ghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone\nout. The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a\ntremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized\nhis utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his unceasingly\nagitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret, to divulge which\nhe struggled for the necessary courage. At times, again, I was obliged\nto resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I\nbeheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of the\nprofoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginary sound. It was\nno wonder that his condition terrified--that it infected me. I felt\ncreeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of\nhis own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.\n\nIt was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the\nseventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within the\ndonjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings. Sleep came\nnot near my couch--while the hours waned and waned away. I struggled to\nreason off the nervousness which had dominion over me. I endeavored to\nbelieve that much, if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering\ninfluence of the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattered\ndraperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a rising\ntempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustled uneasily\nabout the decorations of the bed. But my efforts were fruitless. An\nirrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame; and, at length, there\nsat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm. Shaking\nthis off with a gasp and a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows,\nand, peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber,\nharkened--I know not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted\nme--to certain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses\nof the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence. Overpowered by an\nintense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw on\nmy clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during the\nnight), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into\nwhich I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment.\n\nI had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on an\nadjoining staircase arrested my attention. I presently recognised it as\nthat of Usher. In an instant afterward he rapped, with a gentle touch,\nat my door, and entered, bearing a lamp. His countenance was, as usual,\ncadaverously wan--but, moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in\nhis eyes--an evidently restrained _hysteria_ in his whole demeanor. His\nair appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitude which I had\nso long endured, and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.\n\n\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after having stared about\nhim for some moments in silence--\"you have not then seen it?--but, stay!\nyou shall.\" Thus speaking, and having carefully shaded his lamp, he\nhurried to one of the casements, and threw it freely open to the storm.\n\nThe impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet.\nIt was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and one\nwildly singular in its terror and its beauty. A whirlwind had apparently\ncollected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent and violent\nalterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding density of\nthe clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house)\ndid not prevent our perceiving the life-like velocity with which they\nflew careering from all points against each other, without passing\naway into the distance. I say that even their exceeding density did\nnot prevent our perceiving this--yet we had no glimpse of the moon or\nstars--nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning. But the\nunder surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor, as well as all\nterrestrial objects immediately around us, were glowing in the unnatural\nlight of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation\nwhich hung about and enshrouded the mansion.\n\n\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I, shudderingly, to\nUsher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to a seat.\n\"These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely electrical phenomena\nnot uncommon--or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in\nthe rank miasma of the tarn. Let us close this casement;--the air is\nchilling and dangerous to your frame. Here is one of your favorite\nromances. I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away\nthis terrible night together.\"\n\nThe antique volume which I had taken up was the \"Mad Trist\" of Sir\nLauncelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite of Usher's more in sad\njest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little in its uncouth and\nunimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty\nand spiritual ideality of my friend. It was, however, the only book\nimmediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement\nwhich now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history\nof mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness\nof the folly which I should read. Could I have judged, indeed, by the\nwild overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently\nharkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated\nmyself upon the success of my design.\n\nI had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where Ethelred,\nthe hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable admission\ninto the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an entrance by\nforce. Here, it will be remembered, the words of the narrative run thus:\n\n\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now\nmighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had\ndrunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth,\nwas of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his\nshoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace\noutright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the\ndoor for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so\ncracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and\nhollow-sounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.\"\n\nAt the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment, paused;\nfor it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited\nfancy had deceived me)--it appeared to me that, from some very remote\nportion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to my ears, what might\nhave been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled\nand dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which\nSir Launcelot had so particularly described. It was, beyond doubt,\nthe coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amid the\nrattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinary commingled\nnoises of the still increasing storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing,\nsurely, which should have interested or disturbed me. I continued the\nstory:\n\n\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door, was sore\nenraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit; but,\nin the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor, and\nof a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace of gold, with a\nfloor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass\nwith this legend enwritten--\n\n     Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;\n     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;\n\nAnd Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the dragon,\nwhich fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a shriek so\nhorrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred had fain to\nclose his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it, the like\nwhereof was never before heard.\"\n\nHere again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild\namazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this instance,\nI did actually hear (although from what direction it proceeded I\nfound it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant, but harsh,\nprotracted, and most unusual screaming or grating sound--the exact\ncounterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragon's\nunnatural shriek as described by the romancer.\n\nOppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this second and\nmost extraordinary coincidence, by a thousand conflicting sensations,\nin which wonder and extreme terror were predominant, I still retained\nsufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting, by any observation, the\nsensitive nervousness of my companion. I was by no means certain that\nhe had noticed the sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange\nalteration had, during the last few minutes, taken place in his\ndemeanor. From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought\nround his chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;\nand thus I could but partially perceive his features, although I saw\nthat his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly. His head had\ndropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was not asleep, from the\nwide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a glance of it in profile.\nThe motion of his body, too, was at variance with this idea--for he\nrocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway.\nHaving rapidly taken notice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir\nLauncelot, which thus proceeded:\n\n\"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury of the\ndragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the breaking up\nof the enchantment which was upon it, removed the carcass from out of\nthe way before him, and approached valorously over the silver pavement\nof the castle to where the shield was upon the wall; which in sooth\ntarried not for his full coming, but feel down at his feet upon the\nsilver floor, with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"\n\nNo sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if a shield\nof brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a floor of\nsilver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic, and clangorous,\nyet apparently muffled reverberation. Completely unnerved, I leaped to\nmy feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed. I\nrushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly\nbefore him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony\nrigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a\nstrong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his\nlips; and I saw that he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur,\nas if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length\ndrank in the hideous import of his words.\n\n\"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and _have_ heard it.\nLong--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard\nit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--I dared\nnot--I _dared_ not speak! _We have put her living in the tomb!_ Said I\nnot that my senses were acute? I _now_ tell you that I heard her first\nfeeble movements in the hollow coffin. I heard them--many,\nmany days ago--yet I dared not--_I dared not speak!_ And\nnow--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breaking of the hermit's door,\nand the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield!--say,\nrather, the rending of her coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges of\nher prison, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault!\nOh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying\nto upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?\nDo I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?\nMadman!\"--here he sprang furiously to his feet, and shrieked out his\nsyllables, as if in the effort he were giving up his soul--\"_Madman!\nI tell you that she now stands without the door!_\"\n\nAs if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found\nthe potency of a spell--the huge antique pannels to which the speaker\npointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their ponderous and ebony\njaws. It was the work of the rushing gust--but then without those doors\nthere _did_ stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline\nof Usher. There was blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some\nbitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame. For a moment\nshe remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold--then,\nwith a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her\nbrother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the\nfloor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.\n\nFrom that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast. The storm\nwas still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old\ncauseway. Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned\nto see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house\nand its shadows were alone behind me. The radiance was that of the full,\nsetting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly through that once\nbarely-discernible fissure, of which I have before spoken as extending\nfrom the roof of the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base. While\nI gazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breath of\nthe whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my\nsight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder--there\nwas a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand\nwaters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and\nsilently over the fragments of the \"_House of Usher_.\"\n\n\n\n\nSILENCE--A FABLE\n\n     ALCMAN. The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags and\n     caves are silent.\n\n\"LISTEN to me,\" said the Demon as he placed his hand upon my head. \"The\nregion of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the borders of\nthe river Zaire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.\n\n\"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flow\nnot onwards to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the\nred eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many\nmiles on either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of\ngigantic water-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude,\nand stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to\nand fro their everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which\ncometh out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And\nthey sigh one unto the other.\n\n\"But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,\nhorrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, the\nlow underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughout\nthe heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and\nthither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,\none by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots strange poisonous\nflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustling\nand loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever, until they\nroll, a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no\nwind throughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Zaire there\nis neither quiet nor silence.\n\n\"It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having\nfallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall and the\nrain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the\nsolemnity of their desolation.\n\n\"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was\ncrimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood\nby the shore of the river, and was lighted by the light of the moon. And\nthe rock was gray, and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Upon\nits front were characters engraven in the stone; and I walked through\nthe morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that I\nmight read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decypher them.\nAnd I was going back into the morass, when the moon shone with a\nfuller red, and I turned and looked again upon the rock, and upon the\ncharacters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.\n\n\"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the\nrock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover the\nactions of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and was\nwrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And\nthe outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the\nfeatures of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and\nof the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his\nface. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;\nand, in the few furrows upon his cheek I read the fables of sorrow, and\nweariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.\n\n\"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and\nlooked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquiet\nshrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the\nrustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close within\nshelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the\nman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon the\nrock.\n\n\"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon\nthe dreary river Zaire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the\npale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs of\nthe water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And I\nlay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the\nman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the\nrock.\n\n\"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in\namong the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami\nwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And the\nhippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot\nof the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I lay\nclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the man\ntrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and he sat upon the rock.\n\n\"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightful\ntempest gathered in the heaven where, before, there had been no wind.\nAnd the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the\nrain beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came\ndown--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies\nshrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and\nthe thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its\nfoundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions of\nthe man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned and\nhe sat upon the rock.\n\n\"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river,\nand the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the\nthunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,\nand were still. And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to\nheaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and\nthe clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and\nremained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no\nmore--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow\nof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon the\ncharacters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters were\nSILENCE.\n\n\"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance\nwas wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,\nand stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voice\nthroughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock\nwere SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled\nafar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.\"\n\nNow there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,\nmelancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious histories\nof the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty sea--and of the Genii\nthat over-ruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There was\nmuch lore too in the sayings which were said by the Sybils; and holy,\nholy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around\nDodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon told me as\nhe sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the most\nwonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fell\nback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laugh\nwith the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynx\nwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at\nthe feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH.\n\nTHE \"Red Death\" had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever\nbeen so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal--the\nredness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden\ndizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution. The\nscarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim,\nwere the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy\nof his fellow-men. And the whole seizure, progress and termination of\nthe disease, were the incidents of half an hour.\n\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his\ndominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand\nhale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of\nhis court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his\ncastellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the\ncreation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and\nlofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers,\nhaving entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.\nThey resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden\nimpulses of despair or of frenzy from within. The abbey was amply\nprovisioned. With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to\ncontagion. The external world could take care of itself. In the meantime\nit was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince had provided all the\nappliances of pleasure. There were buffoons, there were improvisatori,\nthere were ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty,\nthere was wine. All these and security were within. Without was the \"Red\nDeath.\"\n\nIt was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion,\nand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that the Prince\nProspero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most\nunusual magnificence.\n\nIt was a voluptuous scene, that masquerade. But first let me tell of the\nrooms in which it was held. There were seven--an imperial suite. In many\npalaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the\nfolding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that\nthe view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case was\nvery different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the\nbizarre. The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision\nembraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at\nevery twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel effect. To the\nright and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic\nwindow looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of\nthe suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in\naccordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber\ninto which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for\nexample, in blue--and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber\nwas purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were\npurple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The\nfourth was furnished and lighted with orange--the fifth with white--the\nsixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black\nvelvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls,\nfalling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But\nin this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with\nthe decorations. The panes here were scarlet--a deep blood color. Now in\nno one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid\nthe profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or\ndepended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from\nlamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors\nthat followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each window, a heavy\ntripod, bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the\ntinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced\na multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or\nblack chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark\nhangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the extreme, and\nproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered,\nthat there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its\nprecincts at all.\n\nIt was in this apartment, also, that there stood against the western\nwall, a gigantic clock of ebony. Its pendulum swung to and fro with a\ndull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the minute-hand made the circuit\nof the face, and the hour was to be stricken, there came from the\nbrazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and\nexceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that, at\neach lapse of an hour, the musicians of the orchestra were constrained\nto pause, momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound;\nand thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was a\nbrief disconcert of the whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the\nclock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale, and the\nmore aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in\nconfused reverie or meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased,\na light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at\neach other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made\nwhispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock\nshould produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of\nsixty minutes, (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of\nthe Time that flies,) there came yet another chiming of the clock,\nand then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as\nbefore.\n\nBut, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.\nThe tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye for colors and\neffects. He disregarded the decora of mere fashion. His plans were bold\nand fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre. There are\nsome who would have thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not.\nIt was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was\nnot.\n\nHe had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments of the seven\nchambers, upon occasion of this great fete; and it was his own guiding\ntaste which had given character to the masqueraders. Be sure they\nwere grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and\nphantasm--much of what has been since seen in \"Hernani.\" There were\narabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were\ndelirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There was much of the\nbeautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the\nterrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.\nTo and fro in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude of\ndreams. And these--the dreams--writhed in and about, taking hue from the\nrooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo\nof their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in\nthe hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is\nsilent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they\nstand. But the echoes of the chime die away--they have endured but an\ninstant--and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after them as they\ndepart. And now again the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe\nto and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted\nwindows through which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the\nchamber which lies most westwardly of the seven, there are now none of\nthe maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a\nruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the\nsable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet,\nthere comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly\nemphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more\nremote gaieties of the other apartments.\n\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat\nfeverishly the heart of life. And the revel went whirlingly on, until at\nlength there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then\nthe music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers\nwere quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before.\nBut now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the\nclock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with\nmore of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who\nrevelled. And thus, too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last\nechoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many\nindividuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the\npresence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no\nsingle individual before. And the rumor of this new presence having\nspread itself whisperingly around, there arose at length from the\nwhole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive of disapprobation and\nsurprise--then, finally, of terror, of horror, and of disgust.\n\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted, it may well be\nsupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation.\nIn truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but\nthe figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds\nof even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts\nof the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with\nthe utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are\nmatters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed\nnow deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger\nneither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and\nshrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The\nmask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the\ncountenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have\nhad difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been\nendured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer\nhad gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was\ndabbled in blood--and his broad brow, with all the features of the face,\nwas besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\n\nWhen the eyes of Prince Prospero fell upon this spectral image (which\nwith a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role,\nstalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in\nthe first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;\nbut, in the next, his brow reddened with rage.\n\n\"Who dares?\" he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near\nhim--\"who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery? Seize him and\nunmask him--that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise, from the\nbattlements!\"\n\nIt was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero\nas he uttered these words. They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly\nand clearly--for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had\nbecome hushed at the waving of his hand.\n\nIt was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale\ncourtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing\nmovement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the\nmoment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step,\nmade closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe\nwith which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole\nparty, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that,\nunimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while\nthe vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of\nthe rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the\nsame solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the\nfirst, through the blue chamber to the purple--through the purple to\nthe green--through the green to the orange--through this again to the\nwhite--and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been\nmade to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,\nmaddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed\nhurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account\nof a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn\ndagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or\nfour feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the\nextremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his\npursuer. There was a sharp cry--and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the\nsable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death\nthe Prince Prospero. Then, summoning the wild courage of despair,\na throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black\napartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and\nmotionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable\nhorror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they\nhandled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form.\n\nAnd now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death. He had come\nlike a thief in the night. And one by one dropped the revellers in the\nblood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing\nposture of his fall. And the life of the ebony clock went out with\nthat of the last of the gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And\nDarkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CASK OF AMONTILLADO.\n\nTHE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; but\nwhen he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the\nnature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to\na threat. _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitively\nsettled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,\nprecluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with\nimpunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its\nredresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make\nhimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.\n\nIt must be understood, that neither by word nor deed had I given\nFortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my wont, to\nsmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at\nthe thought of his immolation.\n\nHe had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was\na man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his\nconnoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\nFor the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and\nopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian\n_millionaires_. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,\nwas a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this\nrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skilful in the\nItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.\n\nIt was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the\ncarnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with\nexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He\nhad on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted\nby the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I\nthought I should never have done wringing his hand.\n\nI said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably\nwell you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes\nfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"How?\" said he. \"Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of\nthe carnival!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the full\nAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to\nbe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"I have my doubts.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"And I must satisfy them.\"\n\n\"Amontillado!\"\n\n\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a\ncritical turn, it is he. He will tell me--\"\n\n\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\n\n\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your\nown.\"\n\n\"Come, let us go.\"\n\n\"Whither?\"\n\n\"To your vaults.\"\n\n\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you\nhave an engagement. Luchesi--\"\n\n\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\n\n\"My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which\nI perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are\nencrusted with nitre.\"\n\n\"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You\nhave been imposed upon. And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry\nfrom Amontillado.\"\n\nThus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask\nof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, I\nsuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.\n\nThere were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in\nhonor of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the\nmorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.\nThese orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate\ndisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.\n\nI took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,\nbowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into\nthe vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him\nto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the\ndescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the\nMontresors.\n\nThe gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled\nas he strode.\n\n\"The pipe,\" said he.\n\n\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work which gleams\nfrom these cavern walls.\"\n\nHe turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that\ndistilled the rheum of intoxication.\n\n\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\n\n\"Nitre,\" I replied. \"How long have you had that cough?\"\n\n\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!\nugh! ugh!\"\n\nMy poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\n\n\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health is\nprecious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as\nonce I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will\ngo back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is\nLuchesi--\"\n\n\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I\nshall not die of a cough.\"\n\n\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming\nyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught of\nthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"\n\nHere I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of\nits fellows that lay upon the mould.\n\n\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.\n\nHe raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me\nfamiliarly, while his bells jingled.\n\n\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\n\n\"And I to your long life.\"\n\nHe again took my arm, and we proceeded.\n\n\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\n\n\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\n\n\"I forget your arms.\"\n\n\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent\nrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\n\n\"And the motto?\"\n\n\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he said.\n\nThe wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew\nwarm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with\ncasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the\ncatacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato\nby an arm above the elbow.\n\n\"The nitre!\" I said: \"see, it increases. It hangs like moss upon the\nvaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle\namong the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough--\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on. But first, another draught of\nthe Medoc.\"\n\nI broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath.\nHis eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle\nupwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n\nI looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\n\n\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n\n\"Not I,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"You are not of the masons.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" I said, \"yes, yes.\"\n\n\"You? Impossible! A mason?\"\n\n\"A mason,\" I replied.\n\n\"A sign,\" he said.\n\n\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\nmy _roquelaire_.\n\n\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. \"But let us proceed to\nthe Amontillado.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again\noffering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route\nin search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches,\ndescended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in\nwhich the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than\nflame.\n\nAt the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\nspacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\nvault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three\nsides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From\nthe fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon\nthe earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall\nthus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still\ninterior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height\nsix or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use\nin itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal\nsupports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their\ncircumscribing walls of solid granite.\n\nIt was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored to\npry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did\nnot enable us to see.\n\n\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi--\"\n\n\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\nforward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had\nreached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested\nby the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered\nhim to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from\neach other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended\na short chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his\nwaist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too\nmuch astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the\nrecess.\n\n\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\nnitre. Indeed it is _very_ damp. Once more let me _implore_ you to\nreturn. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render\nyou all the little attentions in my power.\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\nastonishment.\n\n\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n\nAs I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I\nhave before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of\nbuilding stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my\ntrowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n\nI had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered\nthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\nearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\nof the recess. It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\nlong and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and\nthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The\nnoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\nit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat down upon the\nbones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and\nfinished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\ntier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again\npaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\nfeeble rays upon the figure within.\n\nA succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\nthroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a\nbrief moment I hesitated--I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to\ngrope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant reassured\nme. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt\nsatisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him\nwho clamored. I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume and in\nstrength. I did this, and the clamorer grew still.\n\nIt was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed\nthe eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion\nof the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to\nbe fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it\npartially in its destined position. But now there came from out the\nniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded\nby a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the\nnoble Fortunato. The voice said--\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest. We\nwill have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he! he!--over\nour wine--he! he! he!\"\n\n\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\n\n\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado. But is it not getting\nlate? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato\nand the rest? Let us be gone.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\n\n\"_For the love of God, Montressor!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"\n\nBut to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I\ncalled aloud--\n\n\"Fortunato!\"\n\nNo answer. I called again--\n\n\"Fortunato!\"\n\nNo answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let\nit fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells.\nMy heart grew sick--on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I\nhastened to make an end of my labor. I forced the last stone into its\nposition; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I re-erected the\nold rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed\nthem. _In pace requiescat!_\n\n\n\n\nTHE IMP OF THE PERVERSE\n\nIN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses--of the prima mobilia\nof the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a\npropensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive,\nirreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists\nwho have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of the reason, we have\nall overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses,\nsolely through want of belief--of faith;--whether it be faith in\nRevelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred\nto us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the\nimpulse--for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We\ncould not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had\nthe notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;--we could not\nhave understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects\nof humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that\nphrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been\nconcocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the\nunderstanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs--to\ndictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the\nintentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable\nsystems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first\ndetermined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that\nman should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness,\nand this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I\nnill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God's will that\nman should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness,\nforthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality,\nwith constructiveness,--so, in short, with every organ, whether\nrepresenting a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure\nintellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action,\nthe Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole,\nhave but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors:\ndeducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of\nman, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.\n\nIt would have been wiser, it would have been safer, to classify (if\nclassify we must) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally\ndid, and was always occasionally doing, rather than upon the basis of\nwhat we took it for granted the Deity intended him to do. If we cannot\ncomprehend God in his visible works, how then in his inconceivable\nthoughts, that call the works into being? If we cannot understand him in\nhis objective creatures, how then in his substantive moods and phases of\ncreation?\n\nInduction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an\ninnate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something,\nwhich we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term.\nIn the sense I intend, it is, in fact, a mobile without motive, a motive\nnot motivirt. Through its promptings we act without comprehensible\nobject; or, if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms, we\nmay so far modify the proposition as to say, that through its promptings\nwe act, for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can be\nmore unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain\nminds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible. I\nam not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong\nor error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels\nus, and alone impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming\ntendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or\nresolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive\nimpulse-elementary. It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in\nacts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a\nmodification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness\nof phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. The\nphrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of\nself-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards\nour well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously\nwith its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must\nbe excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a\nmodification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I\nterm perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a\nstrongly antagonistical sentiment exists.\n\nAn appeal to one's own heart is, after all, the best reply to the\nsophistry just noticed. No one who trustingly consults and thoroughly\nquestions his own soul, will be disposed to deny the entire radicalness\nof the propensity in question. It is not more incomprehensible than\ndistinctive. There lives no man who at some period has not been\ntormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by\ncircumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every\nintention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most\nlaconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his\ntongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving\nit flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses;\nyet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and\nparentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough.\nThe impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to\nan uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and\nmortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is\nindulged.\n\nWe have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that\nit will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life\ncalls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are\nconsumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of\nwhose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be\nundertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why?\nThere is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with\nno comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more\nimpatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety\narrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable,\ncraving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly.\nThe last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of\nthe conflict within us,--of the definite with the indefinite--of the\nsubstance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus\nfar, it is the shadow which prevails,--we struggle in vain. The clock\nstrikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is\nthe chanticleer--note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It\nflies--it disappears--we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor\nnow. Alas, it is too late!\n\nWe stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss--we\ngrow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger.\nUnaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and\nhorror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations,\nstill more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor\nfrom the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights.\nBut out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into\npalpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon\nof a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one\nwhich chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the\ndelight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our\nsensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a\nheight. And this fall--this rushing annihilation--for the very reason\nthat it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most\nghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever\npresented themselves to our imagination--for this very cause do we now\nthe most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us\nfrom the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There\nis no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who,\nshuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To\nindulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably\nlost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I\nsay, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we\nfail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss,\nwe plunge, and are destroyed.\n\nExamine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting\nsolely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we\nfeel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible\nprinciple; and we might, indeed, deem this perverseness a direct\ninstigation of the Arch-Fiend, were it not occasionally known to operate\nin furtherance of good.\n\nI have said thus much, that in some measure I may answer your question,\nthat I may explain to you why I am here, that I may assign to you\nsomething that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my\nwearing these fetters, and for my tenanting this cell of the condemned.\nHad I not been thus prolix, you might either have misunderstood me\naltogether, or, with the rabble, have fancied me mad. As it is, you will\neasily perceive that I am one of the many uncounted victims of the Imp\nof the Perverse.\n\nIt is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more\nthorough deliberation. For weeks, for months, I pondered upon the\nmeans of the murder. I rejected a thousand schemes, because their\naccomplishment involved a chance of detection. At length, in reading\nsome French Memoirs, I found an account of a nearly fatal illness that\noccurred to Madame Pilau, through the agency of a candle accidentally\npoisoned. The idea struck my fancy at once. I knew my victim's habit\nof reading in bed. I knew, too, that his apartment was narrow and\nill-ventilated. But I need not vex you with impertinent details. I need\nnot describe the easy artifices by which I substituted, in his bed-room\ncandle-stand, a wax-light of my own making for the one which I there\nfound. The next morning he was discovered dead in his bed, and the\nCoroner's verdict was--\"Death by the visitation of God.\"\n\nHaving inherited his estate, all went well with me for years. The idea\nof detection never once entered my brain. Of the remains of the fatal\ntaper I had myself carefully disposed. I had left no shadow of a clew\nby which it would be possible to convict, or even to suspect me of the\ncrime. It is inconceivable how rich a sentiment of satisfaction arose\nin my bosom as I reflected upon my absolute security. For a very long\nperiod of time I was accustomed to revel in this sentiment. It afforded\nme more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages accruing from\nmy sin. But there arrived at length an epoch, from which the pleasurable\nfeeling grew, by scarcely perceptible gradations, into a haunting and\nharassing thought. It harassed because it haunted. I could scarcely get\nrid of it for an instant. It is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed\nwith the ringing in our ears, or rather in our memories, of the burthen\nof some ordinary song, or some unimpressive snatches from an opera.\nNor will we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good, or\nthe opera air meritorious. In this manner, at last, I would perpetually\ncatch myself pondering upon my security, and repeating, in a low\nundertone, the phrase, \"I am safe.\"\n\nOne day, whilst sauntering along the streets, I arrested myself in the\nact of murmuring, half aloud, these customary syllables. In a fit of\npetulance, I remodelled them thus; \"I am safe--I am safe--yes--if I be\nnot fool enough to make open confession!\"\n\nNo sooner had I spoken these words, than I felt an icy chill creep to\nmy heart. I had had some experience in these fits of perversity, (whose\nnature I have been at some trouble to explain), and I remembered well\nthat in no instance I had successfully resisted their attacks. And now\nmy own casual self-suggestion that I might possibly be fool enough to\nconfess the murder of which I had been guilty, confronted me, as if the\nvery ghost of him whom I had murdered--and beckoned me on to death.\n\nAt first, I made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul.\nI walked vigorously--faster--still faster--at length I ran. I felt\na maddening desire to shriek aloud. Every succeeding wave of thought\noverwhelmed me with new terror, for, alas! I well, too well understood\nthat to think, in my situation, was to be lost. I still quickened my\npace. I bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares. At\nlength, the populace took the alarm, and pursued me. I felt then the\nconsummation of my fate. Could I have torn out my tongue, I would have\ndone it, but a rough voice resounded in my ears--a rougher grasp seized\nme by the shoulder. I turned--I gasped for breath. For a moment I\nexperienced all the pangs of suffocation; I became blind, and deaf,\nand giddy; and then some invisible fiend, I thought, struck me with his\nbroad palm upon the back. The long imprisoned secret burst forth from my\nsoul.\n\nThey say that I spoke with a distinct enunciation, but with marked\nemphasis and passionate hurry, as if in dread of interruption before\nconcluding the brief, but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the\nhangman and to hell.\n\nHaving related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial\nconviction, I fell prostrate in a swoon.\n\nBut why shall I say more? To-day I wear these chains, and am here!\nTo-morrow I shall be fetterless!--but where?\n\n\n\n\nTHE ISLAND OF THE FAY\n\n     Nullus enim locus sine genio est.--_Servius_.\n\n\"LA MUSIQUE,\" says Marmontel, in those \"Contes Moraux\" (*1) which in all\nour translations, we have insisted upon calling \"Moral Tales,\" as if\nin mockery of their spirit--\"la musique est le seul des talents qui\njouissent de lui-meme; tous les autres veulent des temoins.\" He here\nconfounds the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity\nfor creating them. No more than any other talent, is that for music\nsusceptible of complete enjoyment, where there is no second party to\nappreciate its exercise. And it is only in common with other talents\nthat it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The\nidea which the raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or\nhas sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point, is,\ndoubtless, the very tenable one that the higher order of music is\nthe most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone. The\nproposition, in this form, will be admitted at once by those who love\nthe lyre for its own sake, and for its spiritual uses. But there is one\npleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only\none--which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment\nof seclusion. I mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of\nnatural scenery. In truth, the man who would behold aright the glory of\nGod upon earth must in solitude behold that glory. To me, at least, the\npresence--not of human life only, but of life in any other form than\nthat of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless--is\na stain upon the landscape--is at war with the genius of the scene. I\nlove, indeed, to regard the dark valleys, and the gray rocks, and\nthe waters that silently smile, and the forests that sigh in uneasy\nslumbers, and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all,--I\nlove to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast\nanimate and sentient whole--a whole whose form (that of the sphere)\nis the most perfect and most inclusive of all; whose path is among\nassociate planets; whose meek handmaiden is the moon, whose mediate\nsovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity, whose thought is that of\na God; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destinies are lost in\nimmensity, whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance\nof the animalculae which infest the brain--a being which we, in\nconsequence, regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same\nmanner as these animalculae must thus regard us.\n\nOur telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on\nevery hand--notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the\npriesthood--that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important\nconsideration in the eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars\nmove are those best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of\nthe greatest possible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are\naccurately such as, within a given surface, to include the greatest\npossible amount of matter;--while the surfaces themselves are\nso disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be\naccommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged. Nor is it any\nargument against bulk being an object with God, that space itself is\ninfinite; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it. And\nsince we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a\nprinciple--indeed, as far as our judgments extend, the leading principle\nin the operations of Deity,--it is scarcely logical to imagine it\nconfined to the regions of the minute, where we daily trace it, and not\nextending to those of the august. As we find cycle within cycle without\nend,--yet all revolving around one far-distant centre which is the\nGod-head, may we not analogically suppose in the same manner, life\nwithin life, the less within the greater, and all within the Spirit\nDivine? In short, we are madly erring, through self-esteem, in believing\nman, in either his temporal or future destinies, to be of more moment\nin the universe than that vast \"clod of the valley\" which he tills and\ncontemns, and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than\nthat he does not behold it in operation. (*2)\n\nThese fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations\namong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a\ntinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic. My\nwanderings amid such scenes have been many, and far-searching, and often\nsolitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through many a dim,\ndeep valley, or gazed into the reflected Heaven of many a bright lake,\nhas been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I have strayed\nand gazed alone. What flippant Frenchman was it who said in allusion\nto the well-known work of Zimmerman, that, \"la solitude est une belle\nchose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une\nbelle chose?\" The epigram cannot be gainsayed; but the necessity is a\nthing that does not exist.\n\nIt was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region\nof mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarn\nwrithing or sleeping within all--that I chanced upon a certain rivulet\nand island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threw\nmyself upon the turf, beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,\nthat I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus only\nshould I look upon it--such was the character of phantasm which it wore.\n\nOn all sides--save to the west, where the sun was about sinking--arose\nthe verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharply\nin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have\nno exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of\nthe trees to the east--while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared to\nme as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselessly\nand continuously into the valley, a rich golden and crimson waterfall\nfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.\n\nAbout midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one\nsmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the\nstream.\n\nSo blended bank and shadow there\n\nThat each seemed pendulous in air--so mirror-like was the glassy water,\nthat it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the\nemerald turf its crystal dominion began.\n\nMy position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and\nwestern extremities of the islet; and I observed a singularly-marked\ndifference in their aspects. The latter was all one radiant harem of\ngarden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant\nsunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass was short,\nspringy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees were lithe,\nmirthful, erect--bright, slender, and graceful,--of eastern figure and\nfoliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed a\ndeep sense of life and joy about all; and although no airs blew from out\nthe heavens, yet every thing had motion through the gentle sweepings to\nand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for\ntulips with wings. (*4)\n\nThe other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.\nA sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things. The\ntrees were dark in color, and mournful in form and attitude, wreathing\nthemselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of\nmortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore the deep tint of the\ncypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly, and hither and\nthither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low and narrow,\nand not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were not; although\nover and all about them the rue and the rosemary clambered. The shade\nof the trees fell heavily upon the water, and seemed to bury itself\ntherein, impregnating the depths of the element with darkness. I fancied\nthat each shadow, as the sun descended lower and lower, separated itself\nsullenly from the trunk that gave it birth, and thus became absorbed by\nthe stream; while other shadows issued momently from the trees, taking\nthe place of their predecessors thus entombed.\n\nThis idea, having once seized upon my fancy, greatly excited it, and I\nlost myself forthwith in revery. \"If ever island were enchanted,\" said\nI to myself, \"this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays who\nremain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or do\nthey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,\ndo they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God, little by\nlittle, their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,\nexhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is to\nthe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys\nupon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"\n\nAs I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to\nrest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing\nupon their bosom large, dazzling, white flakes of the bark of the\nsycamore-flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a\nquick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased, while\nI thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Fays\nabout whom I had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness\nfrom out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect\nin a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an\noar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude\nseemed indicative of joy--but sorrow deformed it as she passed within\nthe shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and\nre-entered the region of light. \"The revolution which has just been made\nby the Fay,\" continued I, musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year of\nher life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. She\nis a year nearer unto Death; for I did not fail to see that, as she came\ninto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the\ndark water, making its blackness more black.\"\n\nAnd again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of the\nlatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.\nShe floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepened\nmomently) and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and\nbecame absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made the\ncircuit of the island, (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), and\nat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,\nwhile it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each\npassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became\nwhelmed in a shadow more black. But at length when the sun had\nutterly departed, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went\ndisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and\nthat she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over all\nthings and I beheld her magical figure no more.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ASSIGNATION\n\n     Stay for me there!   I will not fail.\n     To meet thee in that hollow vale.\n\n     [_Exequy on the death of his wife, by Henry King,\n      Bishop of Chichester_.]\n\nILL-FATED and mysterious man!--bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own\nimagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth! Again in fancy\nI behold thee! Once more thy form hath risen before me!--not--oh not\nas thou art--in the cold valley and shadow--but as thou _shouldst\nbe_--squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of\ndim visions, thine own Venice--which is a star-beloved Elysium of the\nsea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a\ndeep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters. Yes! I\nrepeat it--as thou _shouldst be_. There are surely other worlds\nthan this--other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude--other\nspeculations than the speculations of the sophist. Who then shall call\nthy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy visionary hours, or\ndenounce those occupations as a wasting away of life, which were but the\noverflowings of thine everlasting energies?\n\nIt was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called the _Ponte di\nSospiri_, that I met for the third or fourth time the person of whom\nI speak. It is with a confused recollection that I bring to mind\nthe circumstances of that meeting. Yet I remember--ah! how should I\nforget?--the deep midnight, the Bridge of Sighs, the beauty of woman,\nand the Genius of Romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal.\n\nIt was a night of unusual gloom. The great clock of the Piazza had\nsounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening. The square of the\nCampanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights in the old Ducal\nPalace were dying fast away. I was returning home from the Piazetta, by\nway of the Grand Canal. But as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth\nof the canal San Marco, a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly\nupon the night, in one wild, hysterical, and long continued shriek.\nStartled at the sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier,\nletting slip his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a\nchance of recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of the\ncurrent which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel.\nLike some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were slowly drifting down\ntowards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the\nwindows, and down the staircases of the Ducal Palace, turned all at once\nthat deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day.\n\nA child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had fallen from an\nupper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal. The\nquiet waters had closed placidly over their victim; and, although my own\ngondola was the only one in sight, many a stout swimmer, already in the\nstream, was seeking in vain upon the surface, the treasure which was\nto be found, alas! only within the abyss. Upon the broad black marble\nflagstones at the entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the\nwater, stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since\nforgotten. It was the Marchesa Aphrodite--the adoration of all\nVenice--the gayest of the gay--the most lovely where all were\nbeautiful--but still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni,\nand the mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now, deep\nbeneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her\nsweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon\nher name.\n\nShe stood alone. Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed in the\nblack mirror of marble beneath her. Her hair, not as yet more than\nhalf loosened for the night from its ball-room array, clustered, amid\na shower of diamonds, round and round her classical head, in curls like\nthose of the young hyacinth. A snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed\nto be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form; but the mid-summer\nand midnight air was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the\nstatue-like form itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very\nvapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe.\nYet--strange to say!--her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards\nupon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried--but riveted in a\nwidely different direction! The prison of the Old Republic is, I think,\nthe stateliest building in all Venice--but how could that lady gaze so\nfixedly upon it, when beneath her lay stifling her only child? Yon dark,\ngloomy niche, too, yawns right opposite her chamber window--what,\nthen, _could_ there be in its shadows--in its architecture--in its\nivy-wreathed and solemn cornices--that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not\nwondered at a thousand times before? Nonsense!--Who does not remember\nthat, at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror,\nmultiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off\nplaces, the woe which is close at hand?\n\nMany steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the water-gate,\nstood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of Mentoni himself. He was\noccasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar, and seemed _ennuye_ to the\nvery death, as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his\nchild. Stupified and aghast, I had myself no power to move from the\nupright position I had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must\nhave presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous\nappearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I floated down\namong them in that funereal gondola.\n\nAll efforts proved in vain. Many of the most energetic in the search\nwere relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a gloomy sorrow. There\nseemed but little hope for the child; (how much less than for the\nmother!) but now, from the interior of that dark niche which has been\nalready mentioned as forming a part of the Old Republican prison, and\nas fronting the lattice of the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak,\nstepped out within reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the\nverge of the giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal. As, in an\ninstant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing\nchild within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the\nMarchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became unfastened,\nand, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to the wonder-stricken\nspectators the graceful person of a very young man, with the sound of\nwhose name the greater part of Europe was then ringing.\n\nNo word spoke the deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive\nher child--she will press it to her heart--she will cling to its little\nform, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! _another's_ arms have\ntaken it from the stranger--_another's_ arms have taken it away, and\nborne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Her\nlip--her beautiful lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes--those\neyes which, like Pliny's acanthus, are \"soft and almost liquid.\" Yes!\ntears are gathering in those eyes--and see! the entire woman thrills\nthroughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor\nof the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very\npurity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide\nof ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate\nframe, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the\ngrass.\n\nWhy _should_ that lady blush! To this demand there is no answer--except\nthat, having left, in the eager haste and terror of a mother's heart,\nthe privacy of her own _boudoir_, she has neglected to enthral her tiny\nfeet in their slippers, and utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian\nshoulders that drapery which is their due. What other possible reason\ncould there have been for her so blushing?--for the glance of those wild\nappealing eyes? for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom?--for the\nconvulsive pressure of that trembling hand?--that hand which fell,\nas Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, upon the hand of the\nstranger. What reason could there have been for the low--the singularly\nlow tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in\nbidding him adieu? \"Thou hast conquered,\" she said, or the murmurs of\nthe water deceived me; \"thou hast conquered--one hour after sunrise--we\nshall meet--so let it be!\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the palace,\nand the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon the flags. He\nshook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye glanced around in search\nof a gondola. I could not do less than offer him the service of my own;\nand he accepted the civility. Having obtained an oar at the water-gate,\nwe proceeded together to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his\nself-possession, and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of\ngreat apparent cordiality.\n\nThere are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being minute. The\nperson of the stranger--let me call him by this title, who to all the\nworld was still a stranger--the person of the stranger is one of these\nsubjects. In height he might have been below rather than above the\nmedium size: although there were moments of intense passion when his\nframe actually _expanded_ and belied the assertion. The light, almost\nslender symmetry of his figure, promised more of that ready activity\nwhich he evinced at the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength\nwhich he has been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of\nmore dangerous emergency. With the mouth and chin of a deity--singular,\nwild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure hazel to intense\nand brilliant jet--and a profusion of curling, black hair, from which\na forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and\nivory--his were features than which I have seen none more classically\nregular, except, perhaps, the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus. Yet\nhis countenance was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen\nat some period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again. It\nhad no peculiar--it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened\nupon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten--but\nforgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of recalling it to mind.\nNot that the spirit of each rapid passion failed, at any time, to\nthrow its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face--but that\nthe mirror, mirror-like, retained no vestige of the passion, when the\npassion had departed.\n\nUpon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited me, in\nwhat I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him _very_ early the\nnext morning. Shortly after sunrise, I found myself accordingly at his\nPalazzo, one of those huge structures of gloomy, yet fantastic pomp,\nwhich tower above the waters of the Grand Canal in the vicinity of the\nRialto. I was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an\napartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door\nwith an actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness.\n\nI knew my acquaintance to be wealthy. Report had spoken of his\npossessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms of\nridiculous exaggeration. But as I gazed about me, I could not bring\nmyself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe could have\nsupplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around.\n\nAlthough, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was still\nbrilliantly lighted up. I judge from this circumstance, as well as from\nan air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend, that he had\nnot retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night. In the\narchitecture and embellishments of the chamber, the evident design\nhad been to dazzle and astound. Little attention had been paid to the\n_decora_ of what is technically called _keeping_, or to the proprieties\nof nationality. The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon\nnone--neither the _grotesques_ of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures\nof the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored Egypt. Rich\ndraperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low,\nmelancholy music, whose origin was not to be discovered. The senses were\noppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange\nconvolute censers, together with multitudinous flaring and flickering\ntongues of emerald and violet fire. The rays of the newly risen sun\npoured in upon the whole, through windows, formed each of a single pane\nof crimson-tinted glass. Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections,\nfrom curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten\nsilver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length fitfully with the\nartificial light, and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of\nrich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha!--ha! ha! ha!\"--laughed the proprietor, motioning me to\na seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at full-length\nupon an ottoman. \"I see,\" said he, perceiving that I could not\nimmediately reconcile myself to the _bienseance_ of so singular a\nwelcome--\"I see you are astonished at my apartment--at my statues--my\npictures--my originality of conception in architecture and upholstery!\nabsolutely drunk, eh, with my magnificence? But pardon me, my dear\nsir, (here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality,)\npardon me for my uncharitable laughter. You appeared so _utterly_\nastonished. Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous, that a man\n_must_ laugh or die. To die laughing, must be the most glorious of\nall glorious deaths! Sir Thomas More--a very fine man was Sir Thomas\nMore--Sir Thomas More died laughing, you remember. Also in the\n_Absurdities_ of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of characters who\ncame to the same magnificent end. Do you know, however,\" continued he\nmusingly, \"that at Sparta (which is now Palae; ochori,) at Sparta, I say,\nto the west of the citadel, among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is\na kind of _socle_, upon which are still legible the letters _AAEM_. They\nare undoubtedly part of _PEAAEMA_. Now, at Sparta were a thousand temples\nand shrines to a thousand different divinities. How exceedingly strange\nthat the altar of Laughter should have survived all the others! But in\nthe present instance,\" he resumed, with a singular alteration of voice\nand manner, \"I have no right to be merry at your expense. You might well\nhave been amazed. Europe cannot produce anything so fine as this, my\nlittle regal cabinet. My other apartments are by no means of the same\norder--mere _ultras_ of fashionable insipidity. This is better than\nfashion--is it not? Yet this has but to be seen to become the rage--that\nis, with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire\npatrimony. I have guarded, however, against any such profanation.\nWith one exception, you are the only human being besides myself and my\n_valet_, who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial\nprecincts, since they have been bedizzened as you see!\"\n\nI bowed in acknowledgment--for the overpowering sense of splendor and\nperfume, and music, together with the unexpected eccentricity of\nhis address and manner, prevented me from expressing, in words, my\nappreciation of what I might have construed into a compliment.\n\n\"Here,\" he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around\nthe apartment, \"here are paintings from the Greeks to Cimabue, and from\nCimabue to the present hour. Many are chosen, as you see, with little\ndeference to the opinions of Virtu. They are all, however, fitting\ntapestry for a chamber such as this. Here, too, are some _chefs\nd'oeuvre_ of the unknown great; and here, unfinished designs by men,\ncelebrated in their day, whose very names the perspicacity of the\nacademies has left to silence and to me. What think you,\" said he,\nturning abruptly as he spoke--\"what think you of this Madonna della\nPieta?\"\n\n\"It is Guido's own!\" I said, with all the enthusiasm of my nature, for I\nhad been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness. \"It is Guido's\nown!--how _could_ you have obtained it?--she is undoubtedly in painting\nwhat the Venus is in sculpture.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said he thoughtfully, \"the Venus--the beautiful Venus?--the Venus\nof the Medici?--she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair? Part of\nthe left arm (here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty,)\nand all the right, are restorations; and in the coquetry of that right\narm lies, I think, the quintessence of all affectation. Give _me_ the\nCanova! The Apollo, too, is a copy--there can be no doubt of it--blind\nfool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the Apollo!\nI cannot help--pity me!--I cannot help preferring the Antinous. Was it\nnot Socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of\nmarble? Then Michael Angelo was by no means original in his couplet--\n\n     'Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto\n     Che un marmo solo in se non circunscriva.'\"\n\nIt has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of the true\ngentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the\nvulgar, without being at once precisely able to determine in what such\ndifference consists. Allowing the remark to have applied in its full\nforce to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance, I felt it, on that\neventful morning, still more fully applicable to his moral temperament\nand character. Nor can I better define that peculiarity of spirit which\nseemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings,\nthan by calling it a _habit_ of intense and continual thought,\npervading even his most trivial actions--intruding upon his moments\nof dalliance--and interweaving itself with his very flashes of\nmerriment--like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning\nmasks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis.\n\nI could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the mingled\ntone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly descanted upon\nmatters of little importance, a certain air of trepidation--a degree of\nnervous _unction_ in action and in speech--an unquiet excitability of\nmanner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable, and upon some\noccasions even filled me with alarm. Frequently, too, pausing in the\nmiddle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten,\nhe seemed to be listening in the deepest attention, as if either in\nmomentary expectation of a visiter, or to sounds which must have had\nexistence in his imagination alone.\n\nIt was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction,\nthat, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar Politian's\nbeautiful tragedy \"The Orfeo,\" (the first native Italian tragedy,)\nwhich lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered a passage underlined in\npencil. It was a passage towards the end of the third act--a passage of\nthe most heart-stirring excitement--a passage which, although tainted\nwith impurity, no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion--no\nwoman without a sigh. The whole page was blotted with fresh tears; and,\nupon the opposite interleaf, were the following English lines,\nwritten in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my\nacquaintance, that I had some difficulty in recognising it as his own:--\n\n     Thou wast that all to me, love,\n     For which my soul did pine--\n     A green isle in the sea, love,\n     A fountain and a shrine,\n     All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers;\n     And all the flowers were mine.\n     Ah, dream too bright to last!\n     Ah, starry Hope, that didst arise\n     But to be overcast!\n     A voice from out the Future cries,\n     \"Onward!\"--but o'er the Past\n     (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies,\n     Mute--motionless--aghast!\n     For alas!  alas!  with me\n     The light of life is o'er.\n     \"No more--no more--no more,\"\n     (Such language holds the solemn sea\n     To the sands upon the shore,)\n     Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,\n     Or the stricken eagle soar!\n     Now all my hours are trances;\n     And all my nightly dreams\n     Are where the dark eye glances,\n     And where thy footstep gleams,\n     In what ethereal dances,\n     By what Italian streams.\n     Alas!  for that accursed time\n     They bore thee o'er the billow,\n     From Love to titled age and crime,\n     And an unholy pillow!--\n     From me, and from our misty clime,\n     Where weeps the silver willow!\n\nThat these lines were written in English--a language with which I had\nnot believed their author acquainted--afforded me little matter for\nsurprise. I was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements, and of\nthe singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation, to\nbe astonished at any similar discovery; but the place of date, I must\nconfess, occasioned me no little amazement. It had been originally\nwritten _London_, and afterwards carefully overscored--not, however, so\neffectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye. I say, this\noccasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a former\nconversation with a friend, I particularly inquired if he had at any\ntime met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni, (who for some years previous\nto her marriage had resided in that city,) when his answer, if I mistake\nnot, gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of\nGreat Britain. I might as well here mention, that I have more than\nonce heard, (without, of course, giving credit to a report\ninvolving so many improbabilities,) that the person of whom I speak, was\nnot only by birth, but in education, an _Englishman_.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"There is one painting,\" said he, without being aware of my notice of\nthe tragedy--\"there is still one painting which you have not seen.\" And\nthrowing aside a drapery, he discovered a full-length portrait of the\nMarchesa Aphrodite.\n\n Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her\nsuperhuman beauty. The same ethereal figure which stood before me the\npreceding night upon the steps of the Ducal Palace, stood before me once\nagain. But in the expression of the countenance, which was beaming all\nover with smiles, there still lurked (incomprehensible anomaly!) that\nfitful stain of melancholy which will ever be found inseparable from the\nperfection of the beautiful. Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.\nWith her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase.\nOne small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth; and,\nscarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to\nencircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most\ndelicately imagined wings. My glance fell from the painting to the\nfigure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman's _Bussy\nD'Ambois_, quivered instinctively upon my lips:\n\n                     \"He is up\n     There like a Roman statue!  He will stand\n     Till Death hath made him marble!\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said at length, turning towards a table of richly enamelled\nand massive silver, upon which were a few goblets fantastically\nstained, together with two large Etruscan vases, fashioned in the same\nextraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait, and\nfilled with what I supposed to be Johannisberger. \"Come,\" he said,\nabruptly, \"let us drink! It is early--but let us drink. It is _indeed_\nearly,\" he continued, musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer\nmade the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise: \"It is\n_indeed_ early--but what matters it? let us drink! Let us pour out an\noffering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers are\nso eager to subdue!\" And, having made me pledge him in a bumper, he\nswallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the wine.\n\n\"To dream,\" he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory\nconversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of the\nmagnificent vases--\"to dream has been the business of my life. I have\ntherefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of dreams. In the heart\nof Venice could I have erected a better? You behold around you, it is\ntrue, a medley of architectural embellishments. The chastity of Ionia\nis offended by antediluvian devices, and the sphynxes of Egypt are\noutstretched upon carpets of gold. Yet the effect is incongruous to\nthe timid alone. Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are\nthe bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the\nmagnificent. Once I was myself a decorist; but that sublimation of folly\nhas palled upon my soul. All this is now the fitter for my purpose. Like\nthese arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing in fire, and the delirium\nof this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land\nof real dreams whither I am now rapidly departing.\" He here paused\nabruptly, bent his head to his bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound\nwhich I could not hear. At length, erecting his frame, he looked\nupwards, and ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester:\n\n     _\"Stay for me there!  I will not fail_\n     _To meet thee in that hollow vale.\"_\n\nIn the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he threw himself\nat full-length upon an ottoman.\n\nA quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud knock at\nthe door rapidly succeeded. I was hastening to anticipate a second\ndisturbance, when a page of Mentoni's household burst into the room, and\nfaltered out, in a voice choking with emotion, the incoherent words,\n\"My mistress!--my mistress!--Poisoned!--poisoned! Oh, beautiful--oh,\nbeautiful Aphrodite!\"\n\nBewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavored to arouse the sleeper\nto a sense of the startling intelligence. But his limbs were rigid--his\nlips were livid--his lately beaming eyes were riveted in _death_.\nI staggered back towards the table--my hand fell upon a cracked and\nblackened goblet--and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth\nflashed suddenly over my soul.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PIT AND THE PENDULUM\n\n     Impia tortorum longos hic turba furores\n     Sanguinis innocui, non satiata, aluit.\n     Sospite nunc patria, fracto nunc funeris antro,\n     Mors ubi dira fuit vita salusque patent.\n\n     [_Quatrain composed for the gates of a market to be erected\n     upon the site of the Jacobin Club House at Paris_.]\n\nI WAS sick--sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at\nlength unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses\nwere leaving me. The sentence--the dread sentence of death--was the last\nof distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of\nthe inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate\nhum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution--perhaps from its\nassociation in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a\nbrief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw;\nbut with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed\njudges. They appeared to me white--whiter than the sheet upon which\nI trace these words--and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the\nintensity of their expression of firmness--of immoveable resolution--of\nstern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me\nwas Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with\na deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I\nshuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of\ndelirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable\ndraperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision\nfell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the\naspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save\nme; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my\nspirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched\nthe wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless\nspectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be\nno help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note,\nthe thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought\ncame gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full\nappreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and\nentertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from\nbefore me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out\nutterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared\nswallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then\nsilence, and stillness, night were the universe.\n\nI had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was\nlost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even\nto describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber--no! In\ndelirium--no! In a swoon--no! In death--no! even in the grave all is\nnot lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most\nprofound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a\nsecond afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not\nthat we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two\nstages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that\nof the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon\nreaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the\nfirst, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf\nbeyond. And that gulf is--what? How at least shall we distinguish its\nshadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have\ntermed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long\ninterval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come?\nHe who has never swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly\nfamiliar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating\nin mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who\nponders over the perfume of some novel flower--is not he whose brain\ngrows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has\nnever before arrested his attention.\n\nAmid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest\nstruggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness\ninto which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have\ndreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I\nhave conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch\nassures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming\nunconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall\nfigures that lifted and bore me in silence down--down--still\ndown--till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the\ninterminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at\nmy heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a\nsense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who\nbore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of\nthe limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After\nthis I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness--the\nmadness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.\n\nVery suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound--the\ntumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its\nbeating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and\nmotion, and touch--a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the\nmere consciousness of existence, without thought--a condition which\nlasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and\nearnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire\nto lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a\nsuccessful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the\njudges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of\nthe swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that\na later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to\nrecall.\n\nSo far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back,\nunbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp\nand hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove\nto imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ\nmy vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not\nthat I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest\nthere should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation\nat heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were\nconfirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled\nfor breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle\nme. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and\nmade effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial\nproceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition.\nThe sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval\nof time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself\nactually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in\nfiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence;--but where and\nin what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at\nthe autos-da-fe, and one of these had been held on the very night of the\nday of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next\nsacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once\nsaw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my\ndungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors,\nand light was not altogether excluded.\n\nA fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart,\nand for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon\nrecovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively\nin every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all\ndirections. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be\nimpeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and\nstood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense grew\nat length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms\nextended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of\ncatching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still\nall was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident\nthat mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.\n\nAnd now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came\nthronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of\nToledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated--fables I\nhad always deemed them--but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save\nin a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean\nworld of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited\nme? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary\nbitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The\nmode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.\n\nMy outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It\nwas a wall, seemingly of stone masonry--very smooth, slimy, and cold.\nI followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which\ncertain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however,\nafforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as\nI might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out,\nwithout being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.\nI therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led\ninto the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been\nexchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the\nblade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point\nof departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although,\nin the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a\npart of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length,\nand at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I\ncould not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at\nleast I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon,\nor upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered\nonward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue\ninduced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.\n\nUpon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf\nand a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon\nthis circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I\nresumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil came at last upon\nthe fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell I had counted\nfifty-two paces, and upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight\nmore;--when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred\npaces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to\nbe fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the\nwall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for\nvault I could not help supposing it to be.\n\nI had little object--certainly no hope--in these researches; but a vague\ncuriosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved\nto cross the area of the enclosure. At first I proceeded with extreme\ncaution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was\ntreacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not\nhesitate to step firmly; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as\npossible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when\nthe remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs.\nI stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.\n\nIn the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a\nsomewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward,\nand while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this--my\nchin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips and the upper\nportion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the\nchin, touched nothing. At the same time my forehead seemed bathed in\na clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my\nnostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen\nat the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had\nno means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just\nbelow the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it\nfall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations\nas it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent; at length\nthere was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes. At the\nsame moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening, and as\nrapid closing of a door overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed\nsuddenly through the gloom, and as suddenly faded away.\n\nI saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated\nmyself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step\nbefore my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just\navoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and\nfrivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its\ntyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies,\nor death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for\nthe latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I\ntrembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a\nfitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.\n\nShaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall; resolving\nthere to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells, of which my\nimagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon.\nIn other conditions of mind I might have had courage to end my misery at\nonce by a plunge into one of these abysses; but now I was the veriest of\ncowards. Neither could I forget what I had read of these pits--that the\nsudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan.\n\nAgitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I\nagain slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf\nand a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied\nthe vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged; for scarcely had I\ndrunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me--a\nsleep like that of death. How long it lasted of course, I know not;\nbut when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were\nvisible. By a wild sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not\nat first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the\nprison.\n\nIn its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls\ndid not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned\nme a world of vain trouble; vain indeed! for what could be of less\nimportance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then\nthe mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in\ntrifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had\ncommitted in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my\nfirst attempt at exploration I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the\nperiod when I fell; I must then have been within a pace or two of the\nfragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the\nvault. I then slept, and upon awaking, I must have returned upon my\nsteps--thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My\nconfusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with\nthe wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.\n\nI had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure.\nIn feeling my way I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of\ngreat irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one\narousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few\nslight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of\nthe prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be\niron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints\noccasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure\nwas rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the\ncharnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends\nin aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really\nfearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the\noutlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that\nthe colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp\natmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the\ncentre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was\nthe only one in the dungeon.\n\nAll this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my personal\ncondition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my\nback, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this\nI was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed\nin many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only\nmy head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much\nexertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by\nmy side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been\nremoved. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst.\nThis thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate:\nfor the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.\n\nLooking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty\nor forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one\nof its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was\nthe painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in\nlieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be\nthe pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks.\nThere was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which\ncaused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward\nat it (for its position was immediately over my own) I fancied that I\nsaw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its\nsweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes,\nsomewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing\nits dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.\n\nA slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, I saw\nseveral enormous rats traversing it. They had issued from the well,\nwhich lay just within view to my right. Even then, while I gazed, they\ncame up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, allured by the scent\nof the meat. From this it required much effort and attention to scare\nthem away.\n\nIt might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take\nbut imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What\nI then saw confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had\nincreased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its\nvelocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me was the\nidea that had perceptibly descended. I now observed--with what horror it\nis needless to say--that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent\nof glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns\nupward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like\na razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into\na solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of\nbrass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.\n\nI could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in\ntorture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial\nagents--the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant\nas myself--the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima\nThule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided\nby the merest of accidents, I knew that surprise, or entrapment into\ntorment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these\ndungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon\nplan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a\ndifferent and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder! I half smiled in\nmy agony as I thought of such application of such a term.\n\nWhat boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more than\nmortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the steel! Inch\nby inch--line by line--with a descent only appreciable at intervals that\nseemed ages--down and still down it came! Days passed--it might have\nbeen that many days passed--ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me\nwith its acrid breath. The odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my\nnostrils. I prayed--I wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy\ndescent. I grew frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upward\nagainst the sweep of the fearful scimitar. And then I fell suddenly\ncalm, and lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare\nbauble.\n\nThere was another interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; for,\nupon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent in\nthe pendulum. But it might have been long; for I knew there were demons\nwho took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at\npleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very--oh, inexpressibly sick\nand weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that\nperiod, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched\nmy left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the\nsmall remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion\nof it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of\njoy--of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a\nhalf formed thought--man has many such which are never completed. I felt\nthat it was of joy--of hope; but felt also that it had perished in its\nformation. In vain I struggled to perfect--to regain it. Long suffering\nhad nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind. I was an\nimbecile--an idiot.\n\nThe vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length. I saw\nthat the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart.\nIt would fray the serge of my robe--it would return and repeat its\noperations--again--and again. Notwithstanding terrifically wide sweep\n(some thirty feet or more) and the hissing vigor of its descent,\nsufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my\nrobe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And\nat this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I\ndwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention--as if, in so dwelling,\nI could arrest here the descent of the steel. I forced myself to\nponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the\ngarment--upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of\ncloth produces on the nerves. I pondered upon all this frivolity until\nmy teeth were on edge.\n\nDown--steadily down it crept. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting\nits downward with its lateral velocity. To the right--to the left--far\nand wide--with the shriek of a damned spirit; to my heart with the\nstealthy pace of the tiger! I alternately laughed and howled as the one\nor the other idea grew predominant.\n\nDown--certainly, relentlessly down! It vibrated within three inches of\nmy bosom! I struggled violently, furiously, to free my left arm. This\nwas free only from the elbow to the hand. I could reach the latter, from\nthe platter beside me, to my mouth, with great effort, but no farther.\nCould I have broken the fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized\nand attempted to arrest the pendulum. I might as well have attempted to\narrest an avalanche!\n\nDown--still unceasingly--still inevitably down! I gasped and struggled\nat each vibration. I shrunk convulsively at its every sweep. My eyes\nfollowed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most\nunmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent,\nalthough death would have been a relief, oh! how unspeakable! Still I\nquivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery\nwould precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom. It was hope\nthat prompted the nerve to quiver--the frame to shrink. It was hope--the\nhope that triumphs on the rack--that whispers to the death-condemned\neven in the dungeons of the Inquisition.\n\nI saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual\ncontact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over\nmy spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. For the first\ntime during many hours--or perhaps days--I thought. It now occurred to\nme that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I\nwas tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent\nathwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be\nunwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in\nthat case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest\nstruggle how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the\ntorturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility! Was it\nprobable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum?\nDreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated,\nI so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. The\nsurcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions--save in\nthe path of the destroying crescent.\n\nScarcely had I dropped my head back into its original position, when\nthere flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than as the\nunformed half of that idea of deliverance to which I have previously\nalluded, and of which a moiety only floated indeterminately through my\nbrain when I raised food to my burning lips. The whole thought was now\npresent--feeble, scarcely sane, scarcely definite,--but still entire.\nI proceeded at once, with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its\nexecution.\n\nFor many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which\nI lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold,\nravenous; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for\nmotionlessness on my part to make me their prey. \"To what food,\" I\nthought, \"have they been accustomed in the well?\"\n\nThey had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a\nsmall remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual\nsee-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter: and, at length, the\nunconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their\nvoracity the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers.\nWith the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I\nthoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising\nmy hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.\n\nAt first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the\nchange--at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many\nsought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in\nvain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion,\none or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the\nsurcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the\nwell they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood--they overran\nit, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the\npendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes they busied\nthemselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed--they swarmed upon me\nin ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips\nsought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust,\nfor which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a\nheavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle\nwould be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew\nthat in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than\nhuman resolution I lay still.\n\nNor had I erred in my calculations--nor had I endured in vain. I at\nlength felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.\nBut the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had\ndivided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath.\nTwice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every\nnerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my\ndeliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement--cautious,\nsidelong, shrinking, and slow--I slid from the embrace of the bandage\nand beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was\nfree.\n\nFree!--and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from\nmy wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the\nmotion of the hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some\ninvisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took\ndesperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--I\nhad but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse\nthan death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves\nnervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something\nunusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciate\ndistinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many\nminutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain,\nunconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the\nfirst time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined\nthe cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width,\nextending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which\nthus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I\nendeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.\n\nAs I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the\nchamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that,\nalthough the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently\ndistinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had\nnow assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense\nbrilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an\naspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon\neyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand\ndirections, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the\nlurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard\nas unreal.\n\nUnreal!--Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of\nthe vapour of heated iron! A suffocating odour pervaded the prison! A\ndeeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies!\nA richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of\nblood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the\ndesign of my tormentors--oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of\nmen! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the\nthought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness\nof the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink.\nI threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof\nillumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit\nrefuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced--it\nwrestled its way into my soul--it burned itself in upon my shuddering\nreason.--Oh! for a voice to speak!--oh! horror!--oh! any horror but\nthis! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my\nhands--weeping bitterly.\n\nThe heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as\nwith a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell--and\nnow the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that\nI, at first, endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking\nplace. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had\nbeen hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying\nwith the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of\nits iron angles were now acute--two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful\ndifference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an\ninstant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But\nthe alteration stopped not here-I neither hoped nor desired it to stop.\nI could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal\npeace. \"Death,\" I said, \"any death but that of the pit!\" Fool! might I\nhave not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron\nto urge me? Could I resist its glow? or, if even that, could I withstand\nits pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a\nrapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of\ncourse, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank\nback--but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length\nfor my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold\non the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of\nmy soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I\nfelt that I tottered upon the brink--I averted my eyes--\n\nThere was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of\nmany trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The\nfiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell,\nfainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French\narmy had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its\nenemies.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PREMATURE BURIAL\n\nTHERE are certain themes of which the interest is all-absorbing, but\nwhich are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction.\nThese the mere romanticist must eschew, if he do not wish to offend or\nto disgust. They are with propriety handled only when the severity and\nmajesty of Truth sanctify and sustain them. We thrill, for example, with\nthe most intense of \"pleasurable pain\" over the accounts of the Passage\nof the Beresina, of the Earthquake at Lisbon, of the Plague at London,\nof the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, or of the stifling of the hundred\nand twenty-three prisoners in the Black Hole at Calcutta. But in these\naccounts it is the fact----it is the reality----it is the history which\nexcites. As inventions, we should regard them with simple abhorrence.\n\nI have mentioned some few of the more prominent and august calamities\non record; but in these it is the extent, not less than the character\nof the calamity, which so vividly impresses the fancy. I need not remind\nthe reader that, from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries,\nI might have selected many individual instances more replete with\nessential suffering than any of these vast generalities of disaster.\nThe true wretchedness, indeed--the ultimate woe----is particular, not\ndiffuse. That the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit,\nand never by man the mass----for this let us thank a merciful God!\n\nTo be buried while alive is, beyond question, the most terrific of these\nextremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality. That it has\nfrequently, very frequently, so fallen will scarcely be denied by those\nwho think. The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best\nshadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends, and where the other\nbegins? We know that there are diseases in which occur total cessations\nof all the apparent functions of vitality, and yet in which these\ncessations are merely suspensions, properly so called. They are only\ntemporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism. A certain period\nelapses, and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the\nmagic pinions and the wizard wheels. The silver cord was not for ever\nloosed, nor the golden bowl irreparably broken. But where, meantime, was\nthe soul?\n\nApart, however, from the inevitable conclusion, a priori that such\ncauses must produce such effects----that the well-known occurrence of\nsuch cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise, now and\nthen, to premature interments--apart from this consideration, we have\nthe direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a\nvast number of such interments have actually taken place. I might refer\nat once, if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances. One of\nvery remarkable character, and of which the circumstances may be fresh\nin the memory of some of my readers, occurred, not very long ago, in the\nneighboring city of Baltimore, where it occasioned a painful, intense,\nand widely-extended excitement. The wife of one of the most respectable\ncitizens--a lawyer of eminence and a member of Congress--was seized with\na sudden and unaccountable illness, which completely baffled the skill\nof her physicians. After much suffering she died, or was supposed to\ndie. No one suspected, indeed, or had reason to suspect, that she was\nnot actually dead. She presented all the ordinary appearances of death.\nThe face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline. The lips were of\nthe usual marble pallor. The eyes were lustreless. There was no warmth.\nPulsation had ceased. For three days the body was preserved unburied,\nduring which it had acquired a stony rigidity. The funeral, in short,\nwas hastened, on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be\ndecomposition.\n\nThe lady was deposited in her family vault, which, for three subsequent\nyears, was undisturbed. At the expiration of this term it was opened\nfor the reception of a sarcophagus;----but, alas! how fearful a shock\nawaited the husband, who, personally, threw open the door! As its\nportals swung outwardly back, some white-apparelled object fell rattling\nwithin his arms. It was the skeleton of his wife in her yet unmoulded\nshroud.\n\nA careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within\ntwo days after her entombment; that her struggles within the coffin had\ncaused it to fall from a ledge, or shelf to the floor, where it was so\nbroken as to permit her escape. A lamp which had been accidentally\nleft, full of oil, within the tomb, was found empty; it might have been\nexhausted, however, by evaporation. On the uttermost of the steps which\nled down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin,\nwith which, it seemed, that she had endeavored to arrest attention by\nstriking the iron door. While thus occupied, she probably swooned, or\npossibly died, through sheer terror; and, in failing, her shroud became\nentangled in some iron--work which projected interiorly. Thus she\nremained, and thus she rotted, erect.\n\nIn the year 1810, a case of living inhumation happened in France,\nattended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that\ntruth is, indeed, stranger than fiction. The heroine of the story was a\nMademoiselle Victorine Lafourcade, a young girl of illustrious family,\nof wealth, and of great personal beauty. Among her numerous suitors was\nJulien Bossuet, a poor litterateur, or journalist of Paris. His talents\nand general amiability had recommended him to the notice of the heiress,\nby whom he seems to have been truly beloved; but her pride of birth\ndecided her, finally, to reject him, and to wed a Monsieur Renelle, a\nbanker and a diplomatist of some eminence. After marriage, however, this\ngentleman neglected, and, perhaps, even more positively ill-treated her.\nHaving passed with him some wretched years, she died,----at least her\ncondition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw\nher. She was buried----not in a vault, but in an ordinary grave in the\nvillage of her nativity. Filled with despair, and still inflamed by the\nmemory of a profound attachment, the lover journeys from the capital to\nthe remote province in which the village lies, with the romantic purpose\nof disinterring the corpse, and possessing himself of its luxuriant\ntresses. He reaches the grave. At midnight he unearths the coffin, opens\nit, and is in the act of detaching the hair, when he is arrested by the\nunclosing of the beloved eyes. In fact, the lady had been buried\nalive. Vitality had not altogether departed, and she was aroused by\nthe caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken\nfor death. He bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village. He\nemployed certain powerful restoratives suggested by no little medical\nlearning. In fine, she revived. She recognized her preserver. She\nremained with him until, by slow degrees, she fully recovered her\noriginal health. Her woman's heart was not adamant, and this last\nlesson of love sufficed to soften it. She bestowed it upon Bossuet.\nShe returned no more to her husband, but, concealing from him her\nresurrection, fled with her lover to America. Twenty years afterward,\nthe two returned to France, in the persuasion that time had so greatly\naltered the lady's appearance that her friends would be unable to\nrecognize her. They were mistaken, however, for, at the first meeting,\nMonsieur Renelle did actually recognize and make claim to his wife.\nThis claim she resisted, and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her\nresistance, deciding that the peculiar circumstances, with the long\nlapse of years, had extinguished, not only equitably, but legally, the\nauthority of the husband.\n\nThe \"Chirurgical Journal\" of Leipsic--a periodical of high authority\nand merit, which some American bookseller would do well to translate\nand republish, records in a late number a very distressing event of the\ncharacter in question.\n\nAn officer of artillery, a man of gigantic stature and of robust\nhealth, being thrown from an unmanageable horse, received a very severe\ncontusion upon the head, which rendered him insensible at once; the\nskull was slightly fractured, but no immediate danger was apprehended.\nTrepanning was accomplished successfully. He was bled, and many other of\nthe ordinary means of relief were adopted. Gradually, however, he fell\ninto a more and more hopeless state of stupor, and, finally, it was\nthought that he died.\n\nThe weather was warm, and he was buried with indecent haste in one of\nthe public cemeteries. His funeral took place on Thursday. On the Sunday\nfollowing, the grounds of the cemetery were, as usual, much thronged\nwith visiters, and about noon an intense excitement was created by\nthe declaration of a peasant that, while sitting upon the grave of\nthe officer, he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth, as if\noccasioned by some one struggling beneath. At first little attention was\npaid to the man's asseveration; but his evident terror, and the dogged\nobstinacy with which he persisted in his story, had at length their\nnatural effect upon the crowd. Spades were hurriedly procured, and the\ngrave, which was shamefully shallow, was in a few minutes so far thrown\nopen that the head of its occupant appeared. He was then seemingly dead;\nbut he sat nearly erect within his coffin, the lid of which, in his\nfurious struggles, he had partially uplifted.\n\nHe was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital, and there pronounced\nto be still living, although in an asphytic condition. After some hours\nhe revived, recognized individuals of his acquaintance, and, in broken\nsentences spoke of his agonies in the grave.\n\nFrom what he related, it was clear that he must have been conscious\nof life for more than an hour, while inhumed, before lapsing into\ninsensibility. The grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an\nexceedingly porous soil; and thus some air was necessarily admitted.\nHe heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead, and endeavored to make\nhimself heard in turn. It was the tumult within the grounds of the\ncemetery, he said, which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep, but\nno sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors\nof his position.\n\nThis patient, it is recorded, was doing well and seemed to be in a fair\nway of ultimate recovery, but fell a victim to the quackeries of medical\nexperiment. The galvanic battery was applied, and he suddenly expired in\none of those ecstatic paroxysms which, occasionally, it superinduces.\n\nThe mention of the galvanic battery, nevertheless, recalls to my memory\na well known and very extraordinary case in point, where its action\nproved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of London,\nwho had been interred for two days. This occurred in 1831, and created,\nat the time, a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject\nof converse.\n\nThe patient, Mr. Edward Stapleton, had died, apparently of typhus fever,\naccompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity\nof his medical attendants. Upon his seeming decease, his friends were\nrequested to sanction a post-mortem examination, but declined to permit\nit. As often happens, when such refusals are made, the practitioners\nresolved to disinter the body and dissect it at leisure, in private.\nArrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of\nbody-snatchers, with which London abounds; and, upon the third night\nafter the funeral, the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight\nfeet deep, and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private\nhospitals.\n\nAn incision of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen,\nwhen the fresh and undecayed appearance of the subject suggested an\napplication of the battery. One experiment succeeded another, and the\ncustomary effects supervened, with nothing to characterize them in any\nrespect, except, upon one or two occasions, a more than ordinary degree\nof life-likeness in the convulsive action.\n\nIt grew late. The day was about to dawn; and it was thought expedient,\nat length, to proceed at once to the dissection. A student, however, was\nespecially desirous of testing a theory of his own, and insisted upon\napplying the battery to one of the pectoral muscles. A rough gash was\nmade, and a wire hastily brought in contact, when the patient, with a\nhurried but quite unconvulsive movement, arose from the table, stepped\ninto the middle of the floor, gazed about him uneasily for a few\nseconds, and then--spoke. What he said was unintelligible, but words\nwere uttered; the syllabification was distinct. Having spoken, he fell\nheavily to the floor.\n\nFor some moments all were paralyzed with awe--but the urgency of the\ncase soon restored them their presence of mind. It was seen that Mr.\nStapleton was alive, although in a swoon. Upon exhibition of ether he\nrevived and was rapidly restored to health, and to the society of his\nfriends--from whom, however, all knowledge of his resuscitation was\nwithheld, until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended. Their\nwonder--their rapturous astonishment--may be conceived.\n\nThe most thrilling peculiarity of this incident, nevertheless, is\ninvolved in what Mr. S. himself asserts. He declares that at no period\nwas he altogether insensible--that, dully and confusedly, he was aware\nof everything which happened to him, from the moment in which he was\npronounced dead by his physicians, to that in which he fell swooning to\nthe floor of the hospital. \"I am alive,\" were the uncomprehended words\nwhich, upon recognizing the locality of the dissecting-room, he had\nendeavored, in his extremity, to utter.\n\nIt were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these--but I\nforbear--for, indeed, we have no need of such to establish the fact that\npremature interments occur. When we reflect how very rarely, from the\nnature of the case, we have it in our power to detect them, we must\nadmit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance. Scarcely,\nin truth, is a graveyard ever encroached upon, for any purpose, to any\ngreat extent, that skeletons are not found in postures which suggest the\nmost fearful of suspicions.\n\nFearful indeed the suspicion--but more fearful the doom! It may be\nasserted, without hesitation, that no event is so terribly well adapted\nto inspire the supremeness of bodily and of mental distress, as is\nburial before death. The unendurable oppression of the lungs--the\nstifling fumes from the damp earth--the clinging to the death\ngarments--the rigid embrace of the narrow house--the blackness of the\nabsolute Night--the silence like a sea that overwhelms--the unseen but\npalpable presence of the Conqueror Worm--these things, with the thoughts\nof the air and grass above, with memory of dear friends who would fly to\nsave us if but informed of our fate, and with consciousness that of this\nfate they can never be informed--that our hopeless portion is that of\nthe really dead--these considerations, I say, carry into the heart,\nwhich still palpitates, a degree of appalling and intolerable horror\nfrom which the most daring imagination must recoil. We know of nothing\nso agonizing upon Earth--we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the\nrealms of the nethermost Hell. And thus all narratives upon this topic\nhave an interest profound; an interest, nevertheless, which, through\nthe sacred awe of the topic itself, very properly and very peculiarly\ndepends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated. What I\nhave now to tell is of my own actual knowledge--of my own positive and\npersonal experience.\n\nFor several years I had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder\nwhich physicians have agreed to term catalepsy, in default of a more\ndefinitive title. Although both the immediate and the predisposing\ncauses, and even the actual diagnosis, of this disease are still\nmysterious, its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well\nunderstood. Its variations seem to be chiefly of degree. Sometimes the\npatient lies, for a day only, or even for a shorter period, in a species\nof exaggerated lethargy. He is senseless and externally motionless; but\nthe pulsation of the heart is still faintly perceptible; some traces of\nwarmth remain; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek;\nand, upon application of a mirror to the lips, we can detect a torpid,\nunequal, and vacillating action of the lungs. Then again the duration\nof the trance is for weeks--even for months; while the closest scrutiny,\nand the most rigorous medical tests, fail to establish any material\ndistinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of\nabsolute death. Very usually he is saved from premature interment solely\nby the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to\ncatalepsy, by the consequent suspicion excited, and, above all, by\nthe non-appearance of decay. The advances of the malady are, luckily,\ngradual. The first manifestations, although marked, are unequivocal. The\nfits grow successively more and more distinctive, and endure each for a\nlonger term than the preceding. In this lies the principal security from\ninhumation. The unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme\ncharacter which is occasionally seen, would almost inevitably be\nconsigned alive to the tomb.\n\nMy own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in\nmedical books. Sometimes, without any apparent cause, I sank, little by\nlittle, into a condition of hemi-syncope, or half swoon; and, in this\ncondition, without pain, without ability to stir, or, strictly speaking,\nto think, but with a dull lethargic consciousness of life and of the\npresence of those who surrounded my bed, I remained, until the crisis of\nthe disease restored me, suddenly, to perfect sensation. At other\ntimes I was quickly and impetuously smitten. I grew sick, and numb, and\nchilly, and dizzy, and so fell prostrate at once. Then, for weeks, all\nwas void, and black, and silent, and Nothing became the universe.\nTotal annihilation could be no more. From these latter attacks I awoke,\nhowever, with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the\nseizure. Just as the day dawns to the friendless and houseless beggar\nwho roams the streets throughout the long desolate winter night--just\nso tardily--just so wearily--just so cheerily came back the light of the\nSoul to me.\n\nApart from the tendency to trance, however, my general health appeared\nto be good; nor could I perceive that it was at all affected by the one\nprevalent malady--unless, indeed, an idiosyncrasy in my ordinary sleep\nmay be looked upon as superinduced. Upon awaking from slumber, I could\nnever gain, at once, thorough possession of my senses, and always\nremained, for many minutes, in much bewilderment and perplexity;--the\nmental faculties in general, but the memory in especial, being in a\ncondition of absolute abeyance.\n\nIn all that I endured there was no physical suffering but of moral\ndistress an infinitude. My fancy grew charnel, I talked \"of worms, of\ntombs, and epitaphs.\" I was lost in reveries of death, and the idea\nof premature burial held continual possession of my brain. The ghastly\nDanger to which I was subjected haunted me day and night. In the former,\nthe torture of meditation was excessive--in the latter, supreme. When\nthe grim Darkness overspread the Earth, then, with every horror of\nthought, I shook--shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse. When\nNature could endure wakefulness no longer, it was with a struggle that\nI consented to sleep--for I shuddered to reflect that, upon awaking, I\nmight find myself the tenant of a grave. And when, finally, I sank into\nslumber, it was only to rush at once into a world of phantasms, above\nwhich, with vast, sable, overshadowing wing, hovered, predominant, the\none sepulchral Idea.\n\nFrom the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams,\nI select for record but a solitary vision. Methought I was immersed in\na cataleptic trance of more than usual duration and profundity. Suddenly\nthere came an icy hand upon my forehead, and an impatient, gibbering\nvoice whispered the word \"Arise!\" within my ear.\n\nI sat erect. The darkness was total. I could not see the figure of him\nwho had aroused me. I could call to mind neither the period at which I\nhad fallen into the trance, nor the locality in which I then lay. While\nI remained motionless, and busied in endeavors to collect my thought,\nthe cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist, shaking it petulantly,\nwhile the gibbering voice said again:\n\n\"Arise! did I not bid thee arise?\"\n\n\"And who,\" I demanded, \"art thou?\"\n\n\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit,\" replied the voice,\nmournfully; \"I was mortal, but am fiend. I was merciless, but am\npitiful. Thou dost feel that I shudder.--My teeth chatter as I speak,\nyet it is not with the chilliness of the night--of the night without\nend. But this hideousness is insufferable. How canst thou tranquilly\nsleep? I cannot rest for the cry of these great agonies. These sights\nare more than I can bear. Get thee up! Come with me into the outer\nNight, and let me unfold to thee the graves. Is not this a spectacle of\nwoe?--Behold!\"\n\nI looked; and the unseen figure, which still grasped me by the wrist,\nhad caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind, and from each\nissued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay, so that I could see into\nthe innermost recesses, and there view the shrouded bodies in their\nsad and solemn slumbers with the worm. But alas! the real sleepers were\nfewer, by many millions, than those who slumbered not at all; and there\nwas a feeble struggling; and there was a general sad unrest; and from\nout the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling\nfrom the garments of the buried. And of those who seemed tranquilly\nto repose, I saw that a vast number had changed, in a greater or less\ndegree, the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been\nentombed. And the voice again said to me as I gazed:\n\n\"Is it not--oh! is it not a pitiful sight?\"--but, before I could find\nwords to reply, the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist, the phosphoric\nlights expired, and the graves were closed with a sudden violence, while\nfrom out them arose a tumult of despairing cries, saying again: \"Is it\nnot--O, God, is it not a very pitiful sight?\"\n\nPhantasies such as these, presenting themselves at night, extended their\nterrific influence far into my waking hours. My nerves became thoroughly\nunstrung, and I fell a prey to perpetual horror. I hesitated to ride, or\nto walk, or to indulge in any exercise that would carry me from home.\nIn fact, I no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence\nof those who were aware of my proneness to catalepsy, lest, falling into\none of my usual fits, I should be buried before my real condition could\nbe ascertained. I doubted the care, the fidelity of my dearest friends.\nI dreaded that, in some trance of more than customary duration, they\nmight be prevailed upon to regard me as irrecoverable. I even went so\nfar as to fear that, as I occasioned much trouble, they might be glad to\nconsider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid\nof me altogether. It was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the\nmost solemn promises. I exacted the most sacred oaths, that under no\ncircumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially\nadvanced as to render farther preservation impossible. And, even\nthen, my mortal terrors would listen to no reason--would accept no\nconsolation. I entered into a series of elaborate precautions. Among\nother things, I had the family vault so remodelled as to admit of being\nreadily opened from within. The slightest pressure upon a long lever\nthat extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back.\nThere were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light,\nand convenient receptacles for food and water, within immediate reach of\nthe coffin intended for my reception. This coffin was warmly and softly\npadded, and was provided with a lid, fashioned upon the principle of the\nvault-door, with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest\nmovement of the body would be sufficient to set it at liberty. Besides\nall this, there was suspended from the roof of the tomb, a large bell,\nthe rope of which, it was designed, should extend through a hole in the\ncoffin, and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse. But, alas?\nwhat avails the vigilance against the Destiny of man? Not even these\nwell-contrived securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of\nliving inhumation, a wretch to these agonies foredoomed!\n\nThere arrived an epoch--as often before there had arrived--in which I\nfound myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first\nfeeble and indefinite sense of existence. Slowly--with a tortoise\ngradation--approached the faint gray dawn of the psychal day. A torpid\nuneasiness. An apathetic endurance of dull pain. No care--no hope--no\neffort. Then, after a long interval, a ringing in the ears; then,\nafter a lapse still longer, a prickling or tingling sensation in the\nextremities; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence,\nduring which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought; then a\nbrief re-sinking into non-entity; then a sudden recovery. At length the\nslight quivering of an eyelid, and immediately thereupon, an electric\nshock of a terror, deadly and indefinite, which sends the blood in\ntorrents from the temples to the heart. And now the first positive\neffort to think. And now the first endeavor to remember. And now a\npartial and evanescent success. And now the memory has so far regained\nits dominion, that, in some measure, I am cognizant of my state. I feel\nthat I am not awaking from ordinary sleep. I recollect that I have been\nsubject to catalepsy. And now, at last, as if by the rush of an ocean,\nmy shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim Danger--by the one\nspectral and ever-prevalent idea.\n\nFor some minutes after this fancy possessed me, I remained without\nmotion. And why? I could not summon courage to move. I dared not\nmake the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate--and yet there was\nsomething at my heart which whispered me it was sure. Despair--such as\nno other species of wretchedness ever calls into being--despair alone\nurged me, after long irresolution, to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes.\nI uplifted them. It was dark--all dark. I knew that the fit was over. I\nknew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed. I knew that I\nhad now fully recovered the use of my visual faculties--and yet it was\ndark--all dark--the intense and utter raylessness of the Night that\nendureth for evermore.\n\nI endeavored to shriek; and my lips and my parched tongue moved\nconvulsively together in the attempt--but no voice issued from the\ncavernous lungs, which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent\nmountain, gasped and palpitated, with the heart, at every elaborate and\nstruggling inspiration.\n\nThe movement of the jaws, in this effort to cry aloud, showed me that\nthey were bound up, as is usual with the dead. I felt, too, that I lay\nupon some hard substance, and by something similar my sides were,\nalso, closely compressed. So far, I had not ventured to stir any of my\nlimbs--but now I violently threw up my arms, which had been lying at\nlength, with the wrists crossed. They struck a solid wooden substance,\nwhich extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six\ninches from my face. I could no longer doubt that I reposed within a\ncoffin at last.\n\nAnd now, amid all my infinite miseries, came sweetly the cherub\nHope--for I thought of my precautions. I writhed, and made spasmodic\nexertions to force open the lid: it would not move. I felt my wrists for\nthe bell-rope: it was not to be found. And now the Comforter fled for\never, and a still sterner Despair reigned triumphant; for I could not\nhelp perceiving the absence of the paddings which I had so carefully\nprepared--and then, too, there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong\npeculiar odor of moist earth. The conclusion was irresistible. I was\nnot within the vault. I had fallen into a trance while absent from\nhome--while among strangers--when, or how, I could not remember--and\nit was they who had buried me as a dog--nailed up in some common\ncoffin--and thrust deep, deep, and for ever, into some ordinary and\nnameless grave.\n\nAs this awful conviction forced itself, thus, into the innermost\nchambers of my soul, I once again struggled to cry aloud. And in this\nsecond endeavor I succeeded. A long, wild, and continuous shriek, or\nyell of agony, resounded through the realms of the subterranean Night.\n\n\"Hillo! hillo, there!\" said a gruff voice, in reply.\n\n\"What the devil's the matter now!\" said a second.\n\n\"Get out o' that!\" said a third.\n\n\"What do you mean by yowling in that ere kind of style, like a\ncattymount?\" said a fourth; and hereupon I was seized and shaken\nwithout ceremony, for several minutes, by a junto of very rough-looking\nindividuals. They did not arouse me from my slumber--for I was wide\nawake when I screamed--but they restored me to the full possession of my\nmemory.\n\nThis adventure occurred near Richmond, in Virginia. Accompanied by a\nfriend, I had proceeded, upon a gunning expedition, some miles down the\nbanks of the James River. Night approached, and we were overtaken by\na storm. The cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream, and\nladen with garden mould, afforded us the only available shelter. We made\nthe best of it, and passed the night on board. I slept in one of the\nonly two berths in the vessel--and the berths of a sloop of sixty or\ntwenty tons need scarcely be described. That which I occupied had no\nbedding of any kind. Its extreme width was eighteen inches. The distance\nof its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same. I found it\na matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in. Nevertheless, I\nslept soundly, and the whole of my vision--for it was no dream, and no\nnightmare--arose naturally from the circumstances of my position--from\nmy ordinary bias of thought--and from the difficulty, to which I have\nalluded, of collecting my senses, and especially of regaining my memory,\nfor a long time after awaking from slumber. The men who shook me were\nthe crew of the sloop, and some laborers engaged to unload it. From the\nload itself came the earthly smell. The bandage about the jaws was a\nsilk handkerchief in which I had bound up my head, in default of my\ncustomary nightcap.\n\nThe tortures endured, however, were indubitably quite equal for the\ntime, to those of actual sepulture. They were fearfully--they were\ninconceivably hideous; but out of Evil proceeded Good; for their very\nexcess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion. My soul acquired\ntone--acquired temper. I went abroad. I took vigorous exercise. I\nbreathed the free air of Heaven. I thought upon other subjects than\nDeath. I discarded my medical books. \"Buchan\" I burned. I read no \"Night\nThoughts\"--no fustian about churchyards--no bugaboo tales--such as\nthis. In short, I became a new man, and lived a man's life. From that\nmemorable night, I dismissed forever my charnel apprehensions, and with\nthem vanished the cataleptic disorder, of which, perhaps, they had been\nless the consequence than the cause.\n\nThere are moments when, even to the sober eye of Reason, the world of\nour sad Humanity may assume the semblance of a Hell--but the imagination\nof man is no Carathis, to explore with impunity its every cavern. Alas!\nthe grim legion of sepulchral terrors cannot be regarded as altogether\nfanciful--but, like the Demons in whose company Afrasiab made his voyage\ndown the Oxus, they must sleep, or they will devour us--they must be\nsuffered to slumber, or we perish.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DOMAIN OF ARNHEIM\n\n     The garden like a lady fair was cut,\n     That lay as if she slumbered in delight,\n     And to the open skies her eyes did shut.\n     The azure fields of Heaven were 'sembled right\n     In a large round, set with the flowers of light.\n     The flowers de luce, and the round sparks of dew.\n     That hung upon their azure leaves did shew\n     Like twinkling stars that sparkle in the evening blue.\n     Giles Fletcher.\n\nFROM his cradle to his grave a gale of prosperity bore my friend Ellison\nalong. Nor do I use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense. I\nmean it as synonymous with happiness. The person of whom I speak seemed\nborn for the purpose of foreshadowing the doctrines of Turgot, Price,\nPriestley, and Condorcet--of exemplifying by individual instance\nwhat has been deemed the chimera of the perfectionists. In the brief\nexistence of Ellison I fancy that I have seen refuted the dogma, that in\nman's very nature lies some hidden principle, the antagonist of bliss.\nAn anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in\ngeneral, from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the\nwretchedness of mankind--that as a species we have in our possession the\nas yet unwrought elements of content--and that, even now, in the present\ndarkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social\ncondition, it is not impossible that man, the individual, under certain\nunusual and highly fortuitous conditions, may be happy.\n\nWith opinions such as these my young friend, too, was fully imbued, and\nthus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which\ndistinguished his life was, in great measure, the result of preconcert.\nIt is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which,\nnow and then, stands so well in the stead of experience, Mr. Ellison\nwould have found himself precipitated, by the very extraordinary success\nof his life, into the common vortex of unhappiness which yawns for those\nof pre-eminent endowments. But it is by no means my object to pen an\nessay on happiness. The ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few\nwords. He admitted but four elementary principles, or more strictly,\nconditions of bliss. That which he considered chief was (strange to\nsay!) the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open\nair. \"The health,\" he said, \"attainable by other means is scarcely worth\nthe name.\" He instanced the ecstasies of the fox-hunter, and pointed to\nthe tillers of the earth, the only people who, as a class, can be fairly\nconsidered happier than others. His second condition was the love of\nwoman. His third, and most difficult of realization, was the contempt\nof ambition. His fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit; and he held\nthat, other things being equal, the extent of attainable happiness was\nin proportion to the spirituality of this object.\n\nEllison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts\nlavished upon him by fortune. In personal grace and beauty he exceeded\nall men. His intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of\nknowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity. His\nfamily was one of the most illustrious of the empire. His bride was the\nloveliest and most devoted of women. His possessions had been always\nample; but on the attainment of his majority, it was discovered that\none of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf\nwhich startle the whole social world amid which they occur, and seldom\nfail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their\nobjects.\n\nIt appears that about a hundred years before Mr. Ellison's coming of\nage, there had died, in a remote province, one Mr. Seabright Ellison.\nThis gentleman had amassed a princely fortune, and, having no immediate\nconnections, conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate\nfor a century after his decease. Minutely and sagaciously directing the\nvarious modes of investment, he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the\nnearest of blood, bearing the name of Ellison, who should be alive at\nthe end of the hundred years. Many attempts had been made to set aside\nthis singular bequest; their ex post facto character rendered them\nabortive; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused, and a\nlegislative act finally obtained, forbidding all similar accumulations.\nThis act, however, did not prevent young Ellison from entering into\npossession, on his twenty-first birthday, as the heir of his ancestor\nSeabright, of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars.\n(*1)\n\nWhen it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited,\nthere were, of course, many speculations as to the mode of its disposal.\nThe magnitude and the immediate availability of the sum bewildered all\nwho thought on the topic. The possessor of any appreciable amount of\nmoney might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things.\nWith riches merely surpassing those of any citizen, it would have\nbeen easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable\nextravagances of his time--or busying himself with political\nintrigue--or aiming at ministerial power--or purchasing increase\nof nobility--or collecting large museums of virtu--or playing the\nmunificent patron of letters, of science, of art--or endowing, and\nbestowing his name upon extensive institutions of charity. But for the\ninconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir, these objects\nand all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field.\nRecourse was had to figures, and these but sufficed to confound. It was\nseen that, even at three per cent., the annual income of the inheritance\namounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand\ndollars; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand\nper month; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and eighty-six per day;\nor one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour; or six and twenty\ndollars for every minute that flew. Thus the usual track of supposition\nwas thoroughly broken up. Men knew not what to imagine. There were some\nwho even conceived that Mr. Ellison would divest himself of at least\none-half of his fortune, as of utterly superfluous opulence--enriching\nwhole troops of his relatives by division of his superabundance. To the\nnearest of these he did, in fact, abandon the very unusual wealth which\nwas his own before the inheritance.\n\nI was not surprised, however, to perceive that he had long made up his\nmind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends.\nNor was I greatly astonished at the nature of his decision. In regard to\nindividual charities he had satisfied his conscience. In the possibility\nof any improvement, properly so called, being effected by man himself in\nthe general condition of man, he had (I am sorry to confess it) little\nfaith. Upon the whole, whether happily or unhappily, he was thrown back,\nin very great measure, upon self.\n\nIn the widest and noblest sense he was a poet. He comprehended,\nmoreover, the true character, the august aims, the supreme majesty and\ndignity of the poetic sentiment. The fullest, if not the sole proper\nsatisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the\ncreation of novel forms of beauty. Some peculiarities, either in his\nearly education, or in the nature of his intellect, had tinged with\nwhat is termed materialism all his ethical speculations; and it was this\nbias, perhaps, which led him to believe that the most advantageous at\nleast, if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise, lies\nin the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness. Thus it\nhappened he became neither musician nor poet--if we use this latter term\nin its every-day acceptation. Or it might have been that he neglected\nto become either, merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of\nambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on\nearth. Is it not indeed, possible that, while a high order of genius\nis necessarily ambitious, the highest is above that which is termed\nambition? And may it not thus happen that many far greater than Milton\nhave contentedly remained \"mute and inglorious?\" I believe that the\nworld has never seen--and that, unless through some series of accidents\ngoading the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion, the world\nwill never see--that full extent of triumphant execution, in the richer\ndomains of art, of which the human nature is absolutely capable.\n\nEllison became neither musician nor poet; although no man lived more\nprofoundly enamored of music and poetry. Under other circumstances than\nthose which invested him, it is not impossible that he would have become\na painter. Sculpture, although in its nature rigorously poetical was too\nlimited in its extent and consequences, to have occupied, at any time,\nmuch of his attention. And I have now mentioned all the provinces in\nwhich the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it\ncapable of expatiating. But Ellison maintained that the richest, the\ntruest, and most natural, if not altogether the most extensive province,\nhad been unaccountably neglected. No definition had spoken of the\nlandscape-gardener as of the poet; yet it seemed to my friend that the\ncreation of the landscape-garden offered to the proper Muse the most\nmagnificent of opportunities. Here, indeed, was the fairest field for\nthe display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of\nnovel beauty; the elements to enter into combination being, by a vast\nsuperiority, the most glorious which the earth could afford. In the\nmultiform and multicolor of the flowers and the trees, he recognised the\nmost direct and energetic efforts of Nature at physical loveliness. And\nin the direction or concentration of this effort--or, more properly,\nin its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth--he\nperceived that he should be employing the best means--laboring to the\ngreatest advantage--in the fulfilment, not only of his own destiny as\npoet, but of the august purposes for which the Deity had implanted the\npoetic sentiment in man.\n\n\"Its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth.\" In his\nexplanation of this phraseology, Mr. Ellison did much toward solving\nwhat has always seemed to me an enigma:--I mean the fact (which none\nbut the ignorant dispute) that no such combination of scenery exists in\nnature as the painter of genius may produce. No such paradises are to\nbe found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of Claude. In the most\nenchanting of natural landscapes, there will always be found a defect\nor an excess--many excesses and defects. While the component parts may\ndefy, individually, the highest skill of the artist, the arrangement\nof these parts will always be susceptible of improvement. In short, no\nposition can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth,\nfrom which an artistical eye, looking steadily, will not find matter of\noffence in what is termed the \"composition\" of the landscape. And\nyet how unintelligible is this! In all other matters we are justly\ninstructed to regard nature as supreme. With her details we shrink from\ncompetition. Who shall presume to imitate the colors of the tulip, or to\nimprove the proportions of the lily of the valley? The criticism which\nsays, of sculpture or portraiture, that here nature is to be exalted or\nidealized rather than imitated, is in error. No pictorial or sculptural\ncombinations of points of human liveliness do more than approach the\nliving and breathing beauty. In landscape alone is the principle of the\ncritic true; and, having felt its truth here, it is but the headlong\nspirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true\nthroughout all the domains of art. Having, I say, felt its truth here;\nfor the feeling is no affectation or chimera. The mathematics afford no\nmore absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his art yields the\nartist. He not only believes, but positively knows, that such and\nsuch apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone\nconstitute the true beauty. His reasons, however, have not yet been\nmatured into expression. It remains for a more profound analysis\nthan the world has yet seen, fully to investigate and express them.\nNevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of\nall his brethren. Let a \"composition\" be defective; let an emendation\nbe wrought in its mere arrangement of form; let this emendation be\nsubmitted to every artist in the world; by each will its necessity\nbe admitted. And even far more than this:--in remedy of the defective\ncomposition, each insulated member of the fraternity would have\nsuggested the identical emendation.\n\nI repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature\nsusceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of\nimprovement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve.\nMy own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive\nintention of nature would have so arranged the earth's surface as to\nhave fulfilled at all points man's sense of perfection in the beautiful,\nthe sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had\nbeen frustrated by the known geological disturbances--disturbances of\nform and color--grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies\nthe soul of art. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by\nthe necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal\nand unadapted to any purpose. It was Ellison who suggested that\nthey were prognostic of death. He thus explained:--Admit the earthly\nimmortality of man to have been the first intention. We have then the\nprimitive arrangement of the earth's surface adapted to his blissful\nestate, as not existent but designed. The disturbances were the\npreparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition.\n\n\"Now,\" said my friend, \"what we regard as exaltation of the landscape\nmay be really such, as respects only the moral or human point of view.\nEach alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish\nin the picture, if we can suppose this picture viewed at large--in\nmass--from some point distant from the earth's surface, although not\nbeyond the limits of its atmosphere. It is easily understood that what\nmight improve a closely scrutinized detail, may at the same time injure\na general or more distantly observed effect. There may be a class of\nbeings, human once, but now invisible to humanity, to whom, from afar,\nour disorder may seem order--our unpicturesqueness picturesque, in a\nword, the earth-angels, for whose scrutiny more especially than our own,\nand for whose death--refined appreciation of the beautiful, may have\nbeen set in array by God the wide landscape-gardens of the hemispheres.\"\n\nIn the course of discussion, my friend quoted some passages from a\nwriter on landscape-gardening who has been supposed to have well treated\nhis theme:\n\n\"There are properly but two styles of landscape-gardening, the natural\nand the artificial. One seeks to recall the original beauty of the\ncountry, by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery, cultivating\ntrees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land;\ndetecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size,\nproportion, and color which, hid from the common observer, are revealed\neverywhere to the experienced student of nature. The result of the\nnatural style of gardening, is seen rather in the absence of all\ndefects and incongruities--in the prevalence of a healthy harmony and\norder--than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles. The\nartificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes\nto gratify. It has a certain general relation to the various styles of\nbuilding. There are the stately avenues and retirements of Versailles;\nItalian terraces; and a various mixed old English style, which\nbears some relation to the domestic Gothic or English Elizabethan\narchitecture. Whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial\nlandscape-gardening, a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it\na great beauty. This is partly pleasing to the eye, by the show of\norder and design, and partly moral. A terrace, with an old moss-covered\nbalustrade, calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed\nthere in other days. The slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of\ncare and human interest.\"\n\n\"From what I have already observed,\" said Ellison, \"you will understand\nthat I reject the idea, here expressed, of recalling the original beauty\nof the country. The original beauty is never so great as that which may\nbe introduced. Of course, every thing depends on the selection of a\nspot with capabilities. What is said about detecting and bringing into\npractice nice relations of size, proportion, and color, is one of those\nmere vaguenesses of speech which serve to veil inaccuracy of thought.\nThe phrase quoted may mean any thing, or nothing, and guides in no\ndegree. That the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen\nrather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the\ncreation of any special wonders or miracles, is a proposition better\nsuited to the grovelling apprehension of the herd than to the fervid\ndreams of the man of genius. The negative merit suggested appertains to\nthat hobbling criticism which, in letters, would elevate Addison into\napotheosis. In truth, while that virtue which consists in the mere\navoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding, and can thus be\ncircumscribed in rule, the loftier virtue, which flames in creation, can\nbe apprehended in its results alone. Rule applies but to the merits of\ndenial--to the excellencies which refrain. Beyond these, the critical\nart can but suggest. We may be instructed to build a \"Cato,\" but we\nare in vain told how to conceive a Parthenon or an \"Inferno.\" The\nthing done, however; the wonder accomplished; and the capacity for\napprehension becomes universal. The sophists of the negative school who,\nthrough inability to create, have scoffed at creation, are now found\nthe loudest in applause. What, in its chrysalis condition of principle,\naffronted their demure reason, never fails, in its maturity of\naccomplishment, to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty.\n\n\"The author's observations on the artificial style,\" continued Ellison,\n\"are less objectionable. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to\nit a great beauty. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense\nof human interest. The principle expressed is incontrovertible--but\nthere may be something beyond it. There may be an object in keeping with\nthe principle--an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed\nby individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the\nlandscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human\ninterest could bestow. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources,\nmight, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as\nour author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with\nextent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual\ninterference. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he\nsecures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his\nwork of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. In the\nmost rugged of wildernesses--in the most savage of the scenes of pure\nnature--there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent\nto reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling.\nNow let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step\ndepressed--to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with\nthe sense of human art--to form an intermedium between the two:--let\nus imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and\ndefinitiveness--whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness,\nshall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the\npart of beings superior, yet akin to humanity--then the sentiment of\ninterest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the\nair of an intermediate or secondary nature--a nature which is not God,\nnor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the\nhandiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.\"\n\nIt was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision\nsuch as this--in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the\npersonal superintendence of his plans--in the unceasing object which\nthese plans afforded--in the high spirituality of the object--in\nthe contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel--in the\nperennial springs with which it gratified, without possibility of\nsatiating, that one master passion of his soul, the thirst for beauty,\nabove all, it was in the sympathy of a woman, not unwomanly, whose\nloveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of\nParadise, that Ellison thought to find, and found, exemption from\nthe ordinary cares of humanity, with a far greater amount of positive\nhappiness than ever glowed in the rapt day-dreams of De Stael.\n\nI despair of conveying to the reader any distinct conception of the\nmarvels which my friend did actually accomplish. I wish to describe, but\nam disheartened by the difficulty of description, and hesitate between\ndetail and generality. Perhaps the better course will be to unite the\ntwo in their extremes.\n\nMr. Ellison's first step regarded, of course, the choice of a locality,\nand scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point, when the luxuriant\nnature of the Pacific Islands arrested his attention. In fact, he\nhad made up his mind for a voyage to the South Seas, when a night's\nreflection induced him to abandon the idea. \"Were I misanthropic,\" he\nsaid, \"such a locale would suit me. The thoroughness of its insulation\nand seclusion, and the difficulty of ingress and egress, would in such\ncase be the charm of charms; but as yet I am not Timon. I wish the\ncomposure but not the depression of solitude. There must remain with me\na certain control over the extent and duration of my repose. There will\nbe frequent hours in which I shall need, too, the sympathy of the poetic\nin what I have done. Let me seek, then, a spot not far from a populous\ncity--whose vicinity, also, will best enable me to execute my plans.\"\n\nIn search of a suitable place so situated, Ellison travelled for several\nyears, and I was permitted to accompany him. A thousand spots with\nwhich I was enraptured he rejected without hesitation, for reasons which\nsatisfied me, in the end, that he was right. We came at length to an\nelevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty, affording a\npanoramic prospect very little less in extent than that of Aetna, and,\nin Ellison's opinion as well as my own, surpassing the far-famed view\nfrom that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque.\n\n\"I am aware,\" said the traveller, as he drew a sigh of deep delight\nafter gazing on this scene, entranced, for nearly an hour, \"I know that\nhere, in my circumstances, nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men\nwould rest content. This panorama is indeed glorious, and I should\nrejoice in it but for the excess of its glory. The taste of all the\narchitects I have ever known leads them, for the sake of 'prospect,' to\nput up buildings on hill-tops. The error is obvious. Grandeur in any of\nits moods, but especially in that of extent, startles, excites--and then\nfatigues, depresses. For the occasional scene nothing can be better--for\nthe constant view nothing worse. And, in the constant view, the most\nobjectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent; the worst phase of\nextent, that of distance. It is at war with the sentiment and with the\nsense of seclusion--the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in\n'retiring to the country.' In looking from the summit of a mountain we\ncannot help feeling abroad in the world. The heart-sick avoid distant\nprospects as a pestilence.\"\n\nIt was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that\nwe found a locality with which Ellison professed himself satisfied. It\nis, of course, needless to say where was the locality. The late death of\nmy friend, in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes\nof visiters, has given to Arnheim a species of secret and subdued if\nnot solemn celebrity, similar in kind, although infinitely superior in\ndegree, to that which so long distinguished Fonthill.\n\nThe usual approach to Arnheim was by the river. The visiter left the\ncity in the early morning. During the forenoon he passed between shores\nof a tranquil and domestic beauty, on which grazed innumerable sheep,\ntheir white fleeces spotting the vivid green of rolling meadows. By\ndegrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral\ncare. This slowly became merged in a sense of retirement--this again in\na consciousness of solitude. As the evening approached, the channel grew\nmore narrow, the banks more and more precipitous; and these latter\nwere clothed in rich, more profuse, and more sombre foliage. The water\nincreased in transparency. The stream took a thousand turns, so that at\nno moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance\nthan a furlong. At every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an\nenchanted circle, having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage,\na roof of ultramarine satin, and no floor--the keel balancing itself\nwith admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which, by some accident\nhaving been turned upside down, floated in constant company with the\nsubstantial one, for the purpose of sustaining it. The channel now\nbecame a gorge--although the term is somewhat inapplicable, and I employ\nit merely because the language has no word which better represents\nthe most striking--not the most distinctive--feature of the scene. The\ncharacter of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of\nthe shores; it was lost altogether in their other traits. The walls of\nthe ravine (through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed) arose\nto an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty\nfeet, and inclined so much toward each other as, in a great measure, to\nshut out the light of day; while the long plume-like moss which depended\ndensely from the intertwining shrubberies overhead, gave the whole\nchasm an air of funereal gloom. The windings became more frequent and\nintricate, and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves, so\nthat the voyager had long lost all idea of direction. He was, moreover,\nenwrapt in an exquisite sense of the strange. The thought of nature\nstill remained, but her character seemed to have undergone modification,\nthere was a weird symmetry, a thrilling uniformity, a wizard propriety\nin these her works. Not a dead branch--not a withered leaf--not a stray\npebble--not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible. The crystal\nwater welled up against the clean granite, or the unblemished moss, with\na sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye.\n\nHaving threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours, the gloom\ndeepening every moment, a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel\nbrought it suddenly, as if dropped from heaven, into a circular basin of\nvery considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge. It\nwas about two hundred yards in diameter, and girt in at all points but\none--that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered--by hills equal\nin general height to the walls of the chasm, although of a thoroughly\ndifferent character. Their sides sloped from the water's edge at an\nangle of some forty-five degrees, and they were clothed from base to\nsummit--not a perceptible point escaping--in a drapery of the most\ngorgeous flower-blossoms; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the\nsea of odorous and fluctuating color. This basin was of great depth, but\nso transparent was the water that the bottom, which seemed to consist of\na thick mass of small round alabaster pebbles, was distinctly visible\nby glimpses--that is to say, whenever the eye could permit itself not\nto see, far down in the inverted heaven, the duplicate blooming of the\nhills. On these latter there were no trees, nor even shrubs of any size.\nThe impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness,\nwarmth, color, quietude, uniformity, softness, delicacy, daintiness,\nvoluptuousness, and a miraculous extremeness of culture that suggested\ndreams of a new race of fairies, laborious, tasteful, magnificent, and\nfastidious; but as the eye traced upward the myriad-tinted slope, from\nits sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the\nfolds of overhanging cloud, it became, indeed, difficult not to fancy\na panoramic cataract of rubies, sapphires, opals, and golden onyxes,\nrolling silently out of the sky.\n\nThe visiter, shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the\nravine, is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun,\nwhich he had supposed to be already far below the horizon, but which now\nconfronts him, and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless\nvista seen through another chasm-like rift in the hills.\n\nBut here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far, and\ndescends into a light canoe of ivory, stained with arabesque devices in\nvivid scarlet, both within and without. The poop and beak of this boat\narise high above the water, with sharp points, so that the general form\nis that of an irregular crescent. It lies on the surface of the bay\nwith the proud grace of a swan. On its ermined floor reposes a single\nfeathery paddle of satin-wood; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be\nseen. The guest is bidden to be of good cheer--that the fates will take\ncare of him. The larger vessel disappears, and he is left alone in the\ncanoe, which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake.\nWhile he considers what course to pursue, however, he becomes aware of a\ngentle movement in the fairy bark. It slowly swings itself around until\nits prow points toward the sun. It advances with a gentle but gradually\naccelerated velocity, while the slight ripples it creates seem to break\nabout the ivory side in divinest melody-seem to offer the only possible\nexplanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin\nthe bewildered voyager looks around him in vain.\n\nThe canoe steadily proceeds, and the rocky gate of the vista is\napproached, so that its depths can be more distinctly seen. To the\nright arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded. It is\nobserved, however, that the trait of exquisite cleanness where the bank\ndips into the water, still prevails. There is not one token of the usual\nriver debris. To the left the character of the scene is softer and more\nobviously artificial. Here the bank slopes upward from the stream in\na very gentle ascent, forming a broad sward of grass of a texture\nresembling nothing so much as velvet, and of a brilliancy of green which\nwould bear comparison with the tint of the purest emerald. This plateau\nvaries in width from ten to three hundred yards; reaching from the\nriver-bank to a wall, fifty feet high, which extends, in an infinity of\ncurves, but following the general direction of the river, until lost in\nthe distance to the westward. This wall is of one continuous rock, and\nhas been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of\nthe stream's southern bank, but no trace of the labor has been suffered\nto remain. The chiselled stone has the hue of ages, and is profusely\noverhung and overspread with the ivy, the coral honeysuckle, the\neglantine, and the clematis. The uniformity of the top and bottom lines\nof the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height,\ngrowing singly or in small groups, both along the plateau and in the\ndomain behind the wall, but in close proximity to it; so that frequent\nlimbs (of the black walnut especially) reach over and dip their pendent\nextremities into the water. Farther back within the domain, the vision\nis impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage.\n\nThese things are observed during the canoe's gradual approach to what I\nhave called the gate of the vista. On drawing nearer to this, however,\nits chasm-like appearance vanishes; a new outlet from the bay is\ndiscovered to the left--in which direction the wall is also seen to\nsweep, still following the general course of the stream. Down this new\nopening the eye cannot penetrate very far; for the stream, accompanied\nby the wall, still bends to the left, until both are swallowed up by the\nleaves.\n\nThe boat, nevertheless, glides magically into the winding channel; and\nhere the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite\nthe wall in the straight vista. Lofty hills, rising occasionally into\nmountains, and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance, still shut in\nthe scene.\n\nFloating gently onward, but with a velocity slightly augmented, the\nvoyager, after many short turns, finds his progress apparently barred by\na gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold, elaborately carved and\nfretted, and reflecting the direct rays of the now fast-sinking sun\nwith an effulgence that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in\nflames. This gate is inserted in the lofty wall; which here appears to\ncross the river at right angles. In a few moments, however, it is seen\nthat the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive\ncurve to the left, the wall following it as before, while a stream of\nconsiderable volume, diverging from the principal one, makes its way,\nwith a slight ripple, under the door, and is thus hidden from sight.\nThe canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate. Its\nponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded. The boat glides\nbetween them, and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre\nentirely begirt with purple mountains, whose bases are laved by a\ngleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit. Meantime\nthe whole Paradise of Arnheim bursts upon the view. There is a gush\nof entrancing melody; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet\nodor,--there is a dream-like intermingling to the eye of tall\nslender Eastern trees--bosky shrubberies--flocks of golden and crimson\nbirds--lily-fringed lakes--meadows of violets, tulips, poppies,\nhyacinths, and tuberoses--long intertangled lines of silver\nstreamlets--and, upspringing confusedly from amid all, a mass of\nsemi-Gothic, semi-Saracenic architecture sustaining itself by miracle in\nmid-air, glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred oriels, minarets,\nand pinnacles; and seeming the phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the\nSylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii and of the Gnomes.\n\n\n\n\nLANDOR'S COTTAGE\n\n     A Pendant to \"The Domain of Arnheim\"\n\nDURING A pedestrian trip last summer, through one or two of the river\ncounties of New York, I found myself, as the day declined, somewhat\nembarrassed about the road I was pursuing. The land undulated very\nremarkably; and my path, for the last hour, had wound about and about so\nconfusedly, in its effort to keep in the valleys, that I no longer knew\nin what direction lay the sweet village of B----, where I had determined\nto stop for the night. The sun had scarcely shone--strictly\nspeaking--during the day, which nevertheless, had been unpleasantly\nwarm. A smoky mist, resembling that of the Indian summer, enveloped all\nthings, and of course, added to my uncertainty. Not that I cared much\nabout the matter. If I did not hit upon the village before sunset,\nor even before dark, it was more than possible that a little\nDutch farmhouse, or something of that kind, would soon make its\nappearance--although, in fact, the neighborhood (perhaps on account of\nbeing more picturesque than fertile) was very sparsely inhabited. At\nall events, with my knapsack for a pillow, and my hound as a sentry, a\nbivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me.\nI sauntered on, therefore, quite at ease--Ponto taking charge of my\ngun--until at length, just as I had begun to consider whether the\nnumerous little glades that led hither and thither, were intended to\nbe paths at all, I was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable\ncarriage track. There could be no mistaking it. The traces of light\nwheels were evident; and although the tall shrubberies and overgrown\nundergrowth met overhead, there was no obstruction whatever below, even\nto the passage of a Virginian mountain wagon--the most aspiring vehicle,\nI take it, of its kind. The road, however, except in being open through\nthe wood--if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of\nlight trees--and except in the particulars of evident wheel-tracks--bore\nno resemblance to any road I had before seen. The tracks of which I\nspeak were but faintly perceptible--having been impressed upon the firm,\nyet pleasantly moist surface of--what looked more like green Genoese\nvelvet than any thing else. It was grass, clearly--but grass such as we\nseldom see out of England--so short, so thick, so even, and so vivid in\ncolor. Not a single impediment lay in the wheel-route--not even a chip\nor dead twig. The stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully\nplaced--not thrown-along the sides of the lane, so as to define its\nboundaries at bottom with a kind of half-precise, half-negligent, and\nwholly picturesque definition. Clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere,\nluxuriantly, in the interspaces.\n\nWhat to make of all this, of course I knew not. Here was art\nundoubtedly--that did not surprise me--all roads, in the ordinary sense,\nare works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the\nmere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might\nhave been done here--with such natural \"capabilities\" (as they have\nit in the books on Landscape Gardening)--with very little labor and\nexpense. No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which\ncaused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and\ndown this fairy-like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered\nadmiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I\ngazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had\nsuperintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken\nto preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand,\nand the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the\nother. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The\nsame effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not\noftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity.\nIt was a piece of \"composition,\" in which the most fastidiously critical\ntaste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.\n\nI had turned to the right as I entered this road, and now, arising, I\ncontinued in the same direction. The path was so serpentine, that at\nno moment could I trace its course for more than two or three paces in\nadvance. Its character did not undergo any material change.\n\nPresently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear--and in a few\nmoments afterward, as I turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than\nhitherto, I became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot\nof a gentle declivity just before me. I could see nothing distinctly on\naccount of the mist which occupied all the little valley below. A gentle\nbreeze, however, now arose, as the sun was about descending; and while\nI remained standing on the brow of the slope, the fog gradually became\ndissipated into wreaths, and so floated over the scene.\n\nAs it came fully into view--thus gradually as I describe it--piece by\npiece, here a tree, there a glimpse of water, and here again the summit\nof a chimney, I could scarcely help fancying that the whole was one of\nthe ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of \"vanishing\npictures.\"\n\nBy the time, however, that the fog had thoroughly disappeared, the sun\nhad made its way down behind the gentle hills, and thence, as if with\na slight chassez to the south, had come again fully into sight, glaring\nwith a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the\nwest. Suddenly, therefore--and as if by the hand of magic--this whole\nvalley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible.\n\nThe first coup d'oeil, as the sun slid into the position described,\nimpressed me very much as I have been impressed, when a boy, by\nthe concluding scene of some well-arranged theatrical spectacle or\nmelodrama. Not even the monstrosity of color was wanting; for the\nsunlight came out through the chasm, tinted all orange and purple; while\nthe vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less\nupon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still hung overhead,\nas if loth to take its total departure from a scene so enchantingly\nbeautiful.\n\nThe little vale into which I thus peered down from under the fog canopy\ncould not have been more than four hundred yards long; while in breadth\nit varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred.\nIt was most narrow at its northern extremity, opening out as it tended\nsouthwardly, but with no very precise regularity. The widest portion\nwas within eighty yards of the southern extreme. The slopes which\nencompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills, unless at their\nnorthern face. Here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of\nsome ninety feet; and, as I have mentioned, the valley at this point was\nnot more than fifty feet wide; but as the visiter proceeded southwardly\nfrom the cliff, he found on his right hand and on his left, declivities\nat once less high, less precipitous, and less rocky. All, in a word,\nsloped and softened to the south; and yet the whole vale was engirdled\nby eminences, more or less high, except at two points. One of these I\nhave already spoken of. It lay considerably to the north of west, and\nwas where the setting sun made its way, as I have before described, into\nthe amphitheatre, through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite\nembankment; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest\npoint, so far as the eye could trace it. It seemed to lead up, up like a\nnatural causeway, into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests.\nThe other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale. Here,\ngenerally, the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations,\nextending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards. In the\nmiddle of this extent was a depression, level with the ordinary floor of\nthe valley. As regards vegetation, as well as in respect to every thing\nelse, the scene softened and sloped to the south. To the north--on the\ncraggy precipice--a few paces from the verge--up sprang the magnificent\ntrunks of numerous hickories, black walnuts, and chestnuts, interspersed\nwith occasional oak, and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the\nwalnuts especially, spread far over the edge of the cliff. Proceeding\nsouthwardly, the explorer saw, at first, the same class of trees,\nbut less and less lofty and Salvatorish in character; then he saw the\ngentler elm, succeeded by the sassafras and locust--these again by the\nsofter linden, red-bud, catalpa, and maple--these yet again by still\nmore graceful and more modest varieties. The whole face of the southern\ndeclivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone--an occasional\nsilver willow or white poplar excepted. In the bottom of the valley\nitself--(for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto\nmentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides)--were to be seen three\ninsulated trees. One was an elm of fine size and exquisite form: it\nstood guard over the southern gate of the vale. Another was a hickory,\nmuch larger than the elm, and altogether a much finer tree, although\nboth were exceedingly beautiful: it seemed to have taken charge of the\nnorthwestern entrance, springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws\nof the ravine, and throwing its graceful body, at an angle of nearly\nforty-five degrees, far out into the sunshine of the amphitheatre. About\nthirty yards east of this tree stood, however, the pride of the valley,\nand beyond all question the most magnificent tree I have ever seen,\nunless, perhaps, among the cypresses of the Itchiatuckanee. It was a\ntriple-stemmed tulip-tree--the Liriodendron Tulipiferum--one of the\nnatural order of magnolias. Its three trunks separated from the parent\nat about three feet from the soil, and diverging very slightly and\ngradually, were not more than four feet apart at the point where the\nlargest stem shot out into foliage: this was at an elevation of about\neighty feet. The whole height of the principal division was one hundred\nand twenty feet. Nothing can surpass in beauty the form, or the glossy,\nvivid green of the leaves of the tulip-tree. In the present instance\nthey were fully eight inches wide; but their glory was altogether\neclipsed by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms. Conceive,\nclosely congregated, a million of the largest and most resplendent\ntulips! Only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture I would\nconvey. And then the stately grace of the clean, delicately-granulated\ncolumnar stems, the largest four feet in diameter, at twenty from the\nground. The innumerable blossoms, mingling with those of other trees\nscarcely less beautiful, although infinitely less majestic, filled the\nvalley with more than Arabian perfumes.\n\nThe general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as\nthat I had found in the road; if anything, more deliciously soft, thick,\nvelvety, and miraculously green. It was hard to conceive how all this\nbeauty had been attained.\n\nI have spoken of two openings into the vale. From the one to the\nnorthwest issued a rivulet, which came, gently murmuring and slightly\nfoaming, down the ravine, until it dashed against the group of rocks out\nof which sprang the insulated hickory. Here, after encircling the tree,\nit passed on a little to the north of east, leaving the tulip tree some\ntwenty feet to the south, and making no decided alteration in its course\nuntil it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries\nof the valley. At this point, after a series of sweeps, it turned off at\nright angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it\nwent--until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure (although\nroughly oval), that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale.\nThis lakelet was, perhaps, a hundred yards in diameter at its widest\npart. No crystal could be clearer than its waters. Its bottom, which\ncould be distinctly seen, consisted altogether, of pebbles brilliantly\nwhite. Its banks, of the emerald grass already described, rounded,\nrather than sloped, off into the clear heaven below; and so clear was\nthis heaven, so perfectly, at times, did it reflect all objects above\nit, that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced,\nit was a point of no little difficulty to determine. The trout, and\nsome other varieties of fish, with which this pond seemed to be almost\ninconveniently crowded, had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish.\nIt was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely\nsuspended in the air. A light birch canoe that lay placidly on the\nwater, was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity unsurpassed\nby the most exquisitely polished mirror. A small island, fairly laughing\nwith flowers in full bloom, and affording little more space than just\nenough for a picturesque little building, seemingly a fowl-house--arose\nfrom the lake not far from its northern shore--to which it was connected\nby means of an inconceivably light--looking and yet very primitive\nbridge. It was formed of a single, broad and thick plank of the tulip\nwood. This was forty feet long, and spanned the interval between shore\nand shore with a slight but very perceptible arch, preventing all\noscillation. From the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation\nof the rivulet, which, after meandering for, perhaps, thirty yards,\nfinally passed through the \"depression\" (already described) in the\nmiddle of the southern declivity, and tumbling down a sheer precipice of\na hundred feet, made its devious and unnoticed way to the Hudson.\n\nThe lake was deep--at some points thirty feet--but the rivulet seldom\nexceeded three, while its greatest width was about eight. Its bottom and\nbanks were as those of the pond--if a defect could have been attributed,\nin point of picturesqueness, it was that of excessive neatness.\n\nThe expanse of the green turf was relieved, here and there, by an\noccasional showy shrub, such as the hydrangea, or the common snowball,\nor the aromatic seringa; or, more frequently, by a clump of geraniums\nblossoming gorgeously in great varieties. These latter grew in pots\nwhich were carefully buried in the soil, so as to give the plants the\nappearance of being indigenous. Besides all this, the lawn's velvet was\nexquisitely spotted with sheep--a considerable flock of which roamed\nabout the vale, in company with three tamed deer, and a vast number of\nbrilliantly-plumed ducks. A very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant\nattendance upon these animals, each and all.\n\nAlong the eastern and western cliffs--where, toward the upper portion of\nthe amphitheatre, the boundaries were more or less precipitous--grew ivy\nin great profusion--so that only here and there could even a glimpse of\nthe naked rock be obtained. The northern precipice, in like manner,\nwas almost entirely clothed by grape-vines of rare luxuriance; some\nspringing from the soil at the base of the cliff, and others from ledges\non its face.\n\nThe slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little\ndomain, was crowned by a neat stone wall, of sufficient height to\nprevent the escape of the deer. Nothing of the fence kind was observable\nelsewhere; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed:--any\nstray sheep, for example, which should attempt to make its way out of\nthe vale by means of the ravine, would find its progress arrested,\nafter a few yards' advance, by the precipitous ledge of rock over which\ntumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as I first drew near\nthe domain. In short, the only ingress or egress was through a gate\noccupying a rocky pass in the road, a few paces below the point at which\nI stopped to reconnoitre the scene.\n\nI have described the brook as meandering very irregularly through the\nwhole of its course. Its two general directions, as I have said, were\nfirst from west to east, and then from north to south. At the turn, the\nstream, sweeping backward, made an almost circular loop, so as to form a\npeninsula which was very nearly an island, and which included about the\nsixteenth of an acre. On this peninsula stood a dwelling-house--and when\nI say that this house, like the infernal terrace seen by Vathek, \"etait\nd'une architecture inconnue dans les annales de la terre,\" I mean,\nmerely, that its tout ensemble struck me with the keenest sense of\ncombined novelty and propriety--in a word, of poetry--(for, than in the\nwords just employed, I could scarcely give, of poetry in the abstract,\na more rigorous definition)--and I do not mean that merely outre was\nperceptible in any respect.\n\nIn fact nothing could well be more simple--more utterly unpretending\nthan this cottage. Its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic\narrangement as a picture. I could have fancied, while I looked at it,\nthat some eminent landscape-painter had built it with his brush.\n\nThe point of view from which I first saw the valley, was not altogether,\nalthough it was nearly, the best point from which to survey the house.\nI will therefore describe it as I afterwards saw it--from a position on\nthe stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre.\n\nThe main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen\nbroad--certainly not more. Its total height, from the ground to the apex\nof the roof, could not have exceeded eighteen feet. To the west end\nof this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its\nproportions:--the line of its front standing back about two yards from\nthat of the larger house, and the line of its roof, of course, being\nconsiderably depressed below that of the roof adjoining. At right angles\nto these buildings, and from the rear of the main one--not exactly in\nthe middle--extended a third compartment, very small--being, in general,\none-third less than the western wing. The roofs of the two larger were\nvery steep--sweeping down from the ridge-beam with a long concave curve,\nand extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front, so as to\nform the roofs of two piazzas. These latter roofs, of course, needed\nno support; but as they had the air of needing it, slight and perfectly\nplain pillars were inserted at the corners alone. The roof of the\nnorthern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof.\nBetween the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather\nslender square chimney of hard Dutch bricks, alternately black and\nred:--a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top. Over the gables\nthe roofs also projected very much:--in the main building about four\nfeet to the east and two to the west. The principal door was not exactly\nin the main division, being a little to the east--while the two windows\nwere to the west. These latter did not extend to the floor, but were\nmuch longer and narrower than usual--they had single shutters like\ndoors--the panes were of lozenge form, but quite large. The door itself\nhad its upper half of glass, also in lozenge panes--a movable shutter\nsecured it at night. The door to the west wing was in its gable, and\nquite simple--a single window looked out to the south. There was no\nexternal door to the north wing, and it also had only one window to the\neast.\n\nThe blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs (with a\nbalustrade) running diagonally across it--the ascent being from the\nsouth. Under cover of the widely projecting eave these steps gave access\nto a door leading to the garret, or rather loft--for it was lighted only\nby a single window to the north, and seemed to have been intended as a\nstore-room.\n\nThe piazzas of the main building and western wing had no floors, as is\nusual; but at the doors and at each window, large, flat irregular slabs\nof granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf, affording comfortable\nfooting in all weather. Excellent paths of the same material--not nicely\nadapted, but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the\nstones, led hither and thither from the house, to a crystal spring about\nfive paces off, to the road, or to one or two out-houses that lay to\nthe north, beyond the brook, and were thoroughly concealed by a few\nlocusts and catalpas.\n\nNot more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the\ndead trunk of a fantastic pear-tree, so clothed from head to foot in\nthe gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to\ndetermine what manner of sweet thing it could be. From various arms of\nthis tree hung cages of different kinds. In one, a large wicker cylinder\nwith a ring at top, revelled a mocking bird; in another an oriole; in a\nthird the impudent bobolink--while three or four more delicate prisons\nwere loudly vocal with canaries.\n\nThe pillars of the piazza were enwreathed in jasmine and sweet\nhoneysuckle; while from the angle formed by the main structure and\nits west wing, in front, sprang a grape-vine of unexampled luxuriance.\nScorning all restraint, it had clambered first to the lower roof--then\nto the higher; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe\non, throwing out tendrils to the right and left, until at length it\nfairly attained the east gable, and fell trailing over the stairs.\n\nThe whole house, with its wings, was constructed of the old-fashioned\nDutch shingles--broad, and with unrounded corners. It is a peculiarity\nof this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being\nwider at bottom than at top--after the manner of Egyptian architecture;\nand in the present instance, this exceedingly picturesque effect was\naided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the\nbase of the buildings.\n\nThe shingles were painted a dull gray; and the happiness with which this\nneutral tint melted into the vivid green of the tulip tree leaves that\npartially overshadowed the cottage, can readily be conceived by an\nartist.\n\nFrom the position near the stone wall, as described, the buildings\nwere seen at great advantage--for the southeastern angle was thrown\nforward--so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts,\nwith the picturesque eastern gable, and at the same time obtained just a\nsufficient glimpse of the northern wing, with parts of a pretty roof\nto the spring-house, and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the\nbrook in the near vicinity of the main buildings.\n\nI did not remain very long on the brow of the hill, although long enough\nto make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet. It was clear that\nI had wandered from the road to the village, and I had thus good\ntraveller's excuse to open the gate before me, and inquire my way, at\nall events; so, without more ado, I proceeded.\n\nThe road, after passing the gate, seemed to lie upon a natural ledge,\nsloping gradually down along the face of the north-eastern cliffs. It\nled me on to the foot of the northern precipice, and thence over the\nbridge, round by the eastern gable to the front door. In this progress,\nI took notice that no sight of the out-houses could be obtained.\n\nAs I turned the corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in\nstern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. I held him\nout my hand, however, in token of amity--and I never yet knew the dog\nwho was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only\nshut his mouth and wagged his tail, but absolutely offered me his\npaw-afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.\n\nAs no bell was discernible, I rapped with my stick against the\ndoor, which stood half open. Instantly a figure advanced to the\nthreshold--that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of\nage--slender, or rather slight, and somewhat above the medium height.\nAs she approached, with a certain modest decision of step altogether\nindescribable. I said to myself, \"Surely here I have found the\nperfection of natural, in contradistinction from artificial grace.\" The\nsecond impression which she made on me, but by far the more vivid of\nthe two, was that of enthusiasm. So intense an expression of romance,\nperhaps I should call it, or of unworldliness, as that which gleamed\nfrom her deep-set eyes, had never so sunk into my heart of hearts\nbefore. I know not how it is, but this peculiar expression of the eye,\nwreathing itself occasionally into the lips, is the most powerful,\nif not absolutely the sole spell, which rivets my interest in woman.\n\"Romance, provided my readers fully comprehended what I would here imply\nby the word--\"romance\" and \"womanliness\" seem to me convertible terms:\nand, after all, what man truly loves in woman, is simply her womanhood.\nThe eyes of Annie (I heard some one from the interior call her \"Annie,\ndarling!\") were \"spiritual grey;\" her hair, a light chestnut: this is\nall I had time to observe of her.\n\nAt her most courteous of invitations, I entered--passing first into a\ntolerably wide vestibule. Having come mainly to observe, I took notice\nthat to my right as I stepped in, was a window, such as those in front\nof the house; to the left, a door leading into the principal room;\nwhile, opposite me, an open door enabled me to see a small apartment,\njust the size of the vestibule, arranged as a study, and having a large\nbow window looking out to the north.\n\nPassing into the parlor, I found myself with Mr. Landor--for this,\nI afterwards found, was his name. He was civil, even cordial in his\nmanner, but just then, I was more intent on observing the arrangements\nof the dwelling which had so much interested me, than the personal\nappearance of the tenant.\n\nThe north wing, I now saw, was a bed-chamber, its door opened into the\nparlor. West of this door was a single window, looking toward the brook.\nAt the west end of the parlor, were a fireplace, and a door leading into\nthe west wing--probably a kitchen.\n\nNothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the\nparlor. On the floor was an ingrain carpet, of excellent texture--a\nwhite ground, spotted with small circular green figures. At the windows\nwere curtains of snowy white jaconet muslin: they were tolerably full,\nand hung decisively, perhaps rather formally in sharp, parallel plaits\nto the floor--just to the floor. The walls were prepared with a French\npaper of great delicacy, a silver ground, with a faint green cord\nrunning zig-zag throughout. Its expanse was relieved merely by three\nof Julien's exquisite lithographs a trois crayons, fastened to the wall\nwithout frames. One of these drawings was a scene of Oriental luxury, or\nrather voluptuousness; another was a \"carnival piece,\" spirited\nbeyond compare; the third was a Greek female head--a face so divinely\nbeautiful, and yet of an expression so provokingly indeterminate, never\nbefore arrested my attention.\n\nThe more substantial furniture consisted of a round table, a few chairs\n(including a large rocking-chair), and a sofa, or rather \"settee;\" its\nmaterial was plain maple painted a creamy white, slightly interstriped\nwith green; the seat of cane. The chairs and table were \"to match,\" but\nthe forms of all had evidently been designed by the same brain which\nplanned \"the grounds;\" it is impossible to conceive anything more\ngraceful.\n\nOn the table were a few books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some\nnovel perfume, a plain ground-glass astral (not solar) lamp with an\nItalian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers.\nFlowers, indeed, of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole\nmere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with\na vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular shelf in each angle of the\nroom stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents.\nOne or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets\nclustered about the open windows.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail, a\npicture of Mr. Landor's residence--as I found it. How he made it what it\nwas--and why--with some particulars of Mr. Landor himself--may, possibly\nform the subject of another article.\n\n\n\n\nWILLIAM WILSON\n\n    What say of it? what say of CONSCIENCE grim,\n    That spectre in my path?\n\n                   _Chamberlayne's Pharronida._\n\nLET me call myself, for the present, William Wilson. The fair page now\nlying before me need not be sullied with my real appellation. This has\nbeen already too much an object for the scorn--for the horror--for the\ndetestation of my race. To the uttermost regions of the globe have not\nthe indignant winds bruited its unparalleled infamy? Oh, outcast of all\noutcasts most abandoned!--to the earth art thou not forever dead? to its\nhonors, to its flowers, to its golden aspirations?--and a cloud, dense,\ndismal, and limitless, does it not hang eternally between thy hopes and\nheaven?\n\nI would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later\nyears of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch--these\nlater years--took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose\norigin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base\nby degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a\nmantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride\nof a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What\nchance--what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me\nwhile I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has\nthrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through\nthe dim valley, for the sympathy--I had nearly said for the pity--of\nmy fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some\nmeasure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish\nthem to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some\nlittle oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them\nallow--what they cannot refrain from allowing--that, although temptation\nmay have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least,\ntempted before--certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he\nhas never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And\nam I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest\nof all sublunary visions?\n\nI am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable\ntemperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my\nearliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family\ncharacter. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed;\nbecoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my\nfriends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted\nto the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions.\nWeak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own,\nmy parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which\ndistinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in\ncomplete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on\nmine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when\nfew children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the\nguidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my\nown actions.\n\nMy earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large,\nrambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England,\nwhere were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all\nthe houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like\nand spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in\nfancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues,\ninhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew\nwith undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell,\nbreaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of\nthe dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded\nand asleep.\n\nIt gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner\nexperience, to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its\nconcerns. Steeped in misery as I am--misery, alas! only too real--I\nshall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary,\nin the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly\ntrivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy,\nadventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when\nand where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which\nafterwards so fully overshadowed me. Let me then remember.\n\nThe house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were\nextensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar\nand broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed\nthe limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week--once every\nSaturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to\ntake brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields--and\ntwice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to\nthe morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of\nthis church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a\nspirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote\npew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the\npulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign,\nwith robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely\npowdered, so rigid and so vast,---could this be he who, of late, with\nsour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand,\nthe Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly\nmonstrous for solution!\n\nAt an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was\nriveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron\nspikes. What impressions of deep awe did it inspire! It was never\nopened save for the three periodical egressions and ingressions already\nmentioned; then, in every creak of its mighty hinges, we found a\nplenitude of mystery--a world of matter for solemn remark, or for more\nsolemn meditation.\n\nThe extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious\nrecesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the\nplay-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well\nremember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within\nit. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small\nparterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred\ndivision we passed only upon rare occasions indeed--such as a first\nadvent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent\nor friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the\nChristmas or Midsummer holy-days.\n\nBut the house!--how quaint an old building was this!--to me how\nveritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its\nwindings--to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at\nany given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories\none happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be\nfound three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral\nbranches were innumerable--inconceivable--and so returning in upon\nthemselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion\nwere not very far different from those with which we pondered upon\ninfinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never able\nto ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little\nsleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other\nscholars.\n\nThe school-room was the largest in the house--I could not help thinking,\nin the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed\nGothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring\nangle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the\nsanctum, \"during hours,\" of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It\nwas a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the\nabsence of the \"Dominic,\" we would all have willingly perished by the\npeine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far\nless reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of\nthese was the pulpit of the \"classical\" usher, one of the \"English and\nmathematical.\" Interspersed about the room, crossing and recrossing\nin endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black,\nancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books,\nand so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque\nfigures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely\nlost what little of original form might have been their portion in days\nlong departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the\nroom, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.\n\nEncompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet\nnot in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life.\nThe teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to\noccupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was\nreplete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived\nfrom luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my\nfirst mental development had in it much of the uncommon--even much of\nthe outre. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence\nrarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray\nshadow--a weak and irregular remembrance--an indistinct regathering of\nfeeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In\nchildhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find\nstamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the\nexergues of the Carthaginian medals.\n\nYet in fact--in the fact of the world's view--how little was there\nto remember! The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed;\nthe connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and\nperambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its\nintrigues;--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to\ninvolve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an\nuniverse of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and\nspirit-stirring. \"Oh, le bon temps, que ce siecle de fer!\"\n\nIn truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my\ndisposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates,\nand by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all\nnot greatly older than myself;--over all with a single exception.\nThis exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although\nno relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself;--a\ncircumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble\ndescent, mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem, by\nprescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property\nof the mob. In this narrative I have therefore designated myself as\nWilliam Wilson,--a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real.\nMy namesake alone, of those who in school phraseology constituted \"our\nset,\" presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class--in the\nsports and broils of the play-ground--to refuse implicit belief in my\nassertions, and submission to my will--indeed, to interfere with my\narbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever. If there is on earth a\nsupreme and unqualified despotism, it is the despotism of a master mind\nin boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions.\n\nWilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest\nembarrassment;--the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in\npublic I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly\nfelt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which\nhe maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority;\nsince not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this\nsuperiority--even this equality--was in truth acknowledged by no one but\nmyself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even\nto suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially\nhis impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more\npointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition\nwhich urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to\nexcel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a\nwhimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there\nwere times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of\nwonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his\ninsults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and\nassuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only\nconceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit\nassuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.\n\nPerhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our\nidentity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school\nupon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers,\namong the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire\nwith much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before\nsaid, or should have said, that Wilson was not, in the most remote\ndegree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers\nwe must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually\nlearned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January,\n1813--and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is\nprecisely that of my own nativity.\n\nIt may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me\nby the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction,\nI could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure,\nnearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of\nvictory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he\nwho had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable\ndignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called \"speaking\nterms,\" while there were many points of strong congeniality in our\ntempers, operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone,\nperhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult,\nindeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards\nhim. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture;--some petulant\nanimosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much\nfear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be\nunnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most\ninseparable of companions.\n\nIt was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us,\nwhich turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open\nor covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain\nwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious\nand determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no\nmeans uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily\nconcocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that\nunassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of\nits own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses\nto be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point,\nand that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from\nconstitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less\nat his wit's end than myself;--my rival had a weakness in the faucal or\nguttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time\nabove a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fail to take what\npoor advantage lay in my power.\n\nWilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his\npractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first\ndiscovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I\nnever could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the\nannoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and\nits very common, if not plebeian praenomen. The words were venom in my\nears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came\nalso to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and\ndoubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would\nbe the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my\npresence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school\nbusiness, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be\noften confounded with my own.\n\nThe feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every\ncircumstance tending to show resemblance, moral or physical, between my\nrival and myself. I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we\nwere of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and\nI perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of\nperson and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching\na relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word,\nnothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously\nconcealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind,\nperson, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason\nto believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and\nin the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a\nsubject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That\nhe observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent;\nbut that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of\nannoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than\nordinary penetration.\n\nHis cue, which was to perfect an imitation of myself, lay both in words\nand in actions; and most admirably did he play his part. My dress it\nwas an easy matter to copy; my gait and general manner were, without\ndifficulty, appropriated; in spite of his constitutional defect, even my\nvoice did not escape him. My louder tones were, of course, unattempted,\nbut then the key, it was identical; and his singular whisper, it grew\nthe very echo of my own.\n\nHow greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could\nnot justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe.\nI had but one consolation--in the fact that the imitation, apparently,\nwas noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing\nand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with\nhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle\nin secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically\ndisregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty\nendeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did\nnot feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in\nhis sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not\nresolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily\nperceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the master air of\nthe copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all\nthe obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my\nindividual contemplation and chagrin.\n\nI have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage\nwhich he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference\nwith my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of\nadvice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it\nwith a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this\ndistant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can\nrecall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side\nof those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming\ninexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents\nand worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might,\nto-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less\nfrequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers\nwhich I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.\n\nAs it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful\nsupervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered\nhis intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our\nconnexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard to him might have\nbeen easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my\nresidence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner\nhad, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly\nsimilar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one\noccasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of\navoiding me.\n\nIt was about the same period, if I remember aright, that, in an\naltercation of violence with him, in which he was more than usually\nthrown off his guard, and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanor\nrather foreign to his nature, I discovered, or fancied I discovered,\nin his accent, his air, and general appearance, a something which first\nstartled, and then deeply interested me, by bringing to mind dim visions\nof my earliest infancy--wild, confused and thronging memories of a\ntime when memory herself was yet unborn. I cannot better describe the\nsensation which oppressed me than by saying that I could with difficulty\nshake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who\nstood before me, at some epoch very long ago--some point of the past\neven infinitely remote. The delusion, however, faded rapidly as it came;\nand I mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation I\nthere held with my singular namesake.\n\nThe huge old house, with its countless subdivisions, had several large\nchambers communicating with each other, where slept the greater number\nof the students. There were, however, (as must necessarily happen in a\nbuilding so awkwardly planned,) many little nooks or recesses, the\nodds and ends of the structure; and these the economic ingenuity of Dr.\nBransby had also fitted up as dormitories; although, being the merest\nclosets, they were capable of accommodating but a single individual. One\nof these small apartments was occupied by Wilson.\n\nOne night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and\nimmediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one\nwrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a\nwilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I\nhad long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit\nat his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful.\nIt was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved\nto make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued.\nHaving reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with\na shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to\nthe sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I\nreturned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close\ncurtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I\nslowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon\nthe sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I\nlooked;--and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my\nframe. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became\npossessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for\nbreath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were\nthese--these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they\nwere his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they\nwere not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I\ngazed;--while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts.\nNot thus he appeared--assuredly not thus--in the vivacity of his waking\nhours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of\narrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation\nof my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within\nthe bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result,\nmerely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation?\nAwe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp,\npassed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that\nold academy, never to enter them again.\n\nAfter a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found\nmyself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to\nenfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least\nto effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which\nI remembered them. The truth--the tragedy--of the drama was no more.\nI could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom\ncalled up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human\ncredulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I\nhereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of scepticism likely to\nbe diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of\nthoughtless folly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly\nplunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at\nonce every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the\nveriest levities of a former existence.\n\nI do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy\nhere--a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded\nthe vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without\nprofit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat\nunusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless\ndissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a\nsecret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for\nour debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The\nwine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more\ndangerous seductions; so that the gray dawn had already faintly appeared\nin the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly\nflushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon\na toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly\ndiverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the\napartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said\nthat some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me\nin the hall.\n\nWildly excited with wine, the unexpected interruption rather delighted\nthan surprised me. I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought\nme to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there\nhung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the\nexceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular\nwindow. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the\nfigure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere\nmorning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the\nmoment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of\nhis face I could not distinguish. Upon my entering he strode hurriedly\nup to me, and, seizing me by the arm with a gesture of petulant\nimpatience, whispered the words \"William Wilson!\" in my ear.\n\nI grew perfectly sober in an instant. There was that in the manner of\nthe stranger, and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger, as he\nheld it between my eyes and the light, which filled me with unqualified\namazement; but it was not this which had so violently moved me. It\nwas the pregnancy of solemn admonition in the singular, low, hissing\nutterance; and, above all, it was the character, the tone, the key, of\nthose few, simple, and familiar, yet whispered syllables, which came\nwith a thousand thronging memories of bygone days, and struck upon my\nsoul with the shock of a galvanic battery. Ere I could recover the use\nof my senses he was gone.\n\nAlthough this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered\nimagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I\nbusied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid\nspeculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the\nidentity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered\nwith my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But\nwho and what was this Wilson?--and whence came he?--and what were his\npurposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely\nascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had\ncaused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the\nday in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased\nto think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in\na contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the\nuncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and\nannual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in\nthe luxury already so dear to my heart,--to vie in profuseness of\nexpenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in\nGreat Britain.\n\nExcited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke\nforth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of\ndecency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to\npause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among\nspendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude\nof novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of\nvices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.\n\nIt could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly\nfallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintance with the\nvilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept\nin his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of\nincreasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded\namong my fellow-collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the\nvery enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment\nproved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity\nwith which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned\nassociates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his\nsenses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the\ngenerous William Wilson--the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford--him\nwhose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and\nunbridled fancy--whose errors but inimitable whim--whose darkest vice\nbut a careless and dashing extravagance?\n\nI had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there\ncame to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning--rich, said\nreport, as Herodes Atticus--his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon\nfound him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting\nsubject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived,\nwith the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more\neffectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being\nripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be\nfinal and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,)\nequally intimate with both, but who, to do him Justice, entertained\nnot even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better\ncolouring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or\nten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should\nappear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated\ndupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was\nomitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter\nfor wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.\n\nWe had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length\neffected the manoeuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The\ngame, too, was my favorite ecarte! The rest of the company, interested\nin the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were\nstanding around us as spectators. The parvenu, who had been induced\nby my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now\nshuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which\nhis intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether\naccount. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large\namount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely\nwhat I had been coolly anticipating--he proposed to double our already\nextravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not\nuntil after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words\nwhich gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The\nresult, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils;\nin less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his\ncountenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but\nnow, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly\nfearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to\nmy eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had\nas yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very\nseriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome\nby the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented\nitself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character\nin the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I\nwas about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play,\nwhen some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an\nejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me\nto understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances\nwhich, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have\nprotected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.\n\nWhat now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable\ncondition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all;\nand, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I\ncould not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances\nof scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party.\nI will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a\nbrief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary\ninterruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the\napartment were all at once thrown open, to their full extent, with a\nvigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic,\nevery candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to\nperceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely\nmuffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could\nonly feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could\nrecover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had\nthrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said, in a low, distinct, and never-to-be-forgotten\nwhisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones, \"Gentlemen, I\nmake no apology for this behaviour, because in thus behaving, I am\nbut fulfilling a duty. You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true\ncharacter of the person who has to-night won at ecarte a large sum\nof money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an\nexpeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary\ninformation. Please to examine, at your leisure, the inner linings of\nthe cuff of his left sleeve, and the several little packages which may\nbe found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning\nwrapper.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, so profound was the stillness that one might have heard\na pin drop upon the floor. In ceasing, he departed at once, and as\nabruptly as he had entered. Can I--shall I describe my sensations?--must\nI say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had\nlittle time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the\nspot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the\nlining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in ecarte,\nand, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, facsimiles of\nthose used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of\nthe species called, technically, arrondees; the honours being slightly\nconvex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In\nthis disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the\npack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while\nthe gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for\nhis victim which may count in the records of the game.\n\nAny burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less\nthan the silent contempt, or the sarcastic composure, with which it was\nreceived.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson,\" said our host, stooping to remove from beneath his feet\nan exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs, \"Mr. Wilson, this is your\nproperty.\" (The weather was cold; and, upon quitting my own room, I had\nthrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper, putting it off upon reaching\nthe scene of play.) \"I presume it is supererogatory to seek here (eyeing\nthe folds of the garment with a bitter smile) for any farther evidence\nof your skill. Indeed, we have had enough. You will see the necessity,\nI hope, of quitting Oxford--at all events, of quitting instantly my\nchambers.\"\n\nAbased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should\nhave resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had\nnot my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the\nmost startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare\ndescription of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not\nventure to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for\nI was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this\nfrivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which\nhe had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the\napartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror,\nthat I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt\nunwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact\ncounterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. The\nsingular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled,\nI remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of\nthe members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some\npresence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it,\nunnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of\ndefiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey\nfrom Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.\n\nI fled in vain. My evil destiny pursued me as if in exultation, and\nproved, indeed, that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet\nonly begun. Scarcely had I set foot in Paris ere I had fresh evidence of\nthe detestable interest taken by this Wilson in my concerns. Years flew,\nwhile I experienced no relief. Villain!--at Rome, with how untimely,\nyet with how spectral an officiousness, stepped he in between me and my\nambition! At Vienna, too--at Berlin--and at Moscow! Where, in truth, had\nI not bitter cause to curse him within my heart? From his inscrutable\ntyranny did I at length flee, panic-stricken, as from a pestilence; and\nto the very ends of the earth I fled in vain.\n\nAnd again, and again, in secret communion with my own spirit, would\nI demand the questions \"Who is he?--whence came he?--and what are his\nobjects?\" But no answer was there found. And then I scrutinized, with a\nminute scrutiny, the forms, and the methods, and the leading traits of\nhis impertinent supervision. But even here there was very little upon\nwhich to base a conjecture. It was noticeable, indeed, that, in no one\nof the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path, had\nhe so crossed it except to frustrate those schemes, or to disturb those\nactions, which, if fully carried out, might have resulted in bitter\nmischief. Poor justification this, in truth, for an authority so\nimperiously assumed! Poor indemnity for natural rights of self-agency so\npertinaciously, so insultingly denied!\n\nI had also been forced to notice that my tormentor, for a very long\nperiod of time, (while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity\nmaintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself,) had so\ncontrived it, in the execution of his varied interference with my will,\nthat I saw not, at any moment, the features of his face. Be Wilson what\nhe might, this, at least, was but the veriest of affectation, or of\nfolly. Could he, for an instant, have supposed that, in my admonisher\nat Eton--in the destroyer of my honor at Oxford,--in him who thwarted my\nambition at Rome, my revenge at Paris, my passionate love at Naples, or\nwhat he falsely termed my avarice in Egypt,--that in this, my arch-enemy\nand evil genius, could fail to recognise the William Wilson of my\nschool boy days,--the namesake, the companion, the rival,--the hated and\ndreaded rival at Dr. Bransby's? Impossible!--But let me hasten to the\nlast eventful scene of the drama.\n\nThus far I had succumbed supinely to this imperious domination. The\nsentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated\ncharacter, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and\nomnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which\ncertain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had\noperated, hitherto, to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness\nand helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly\nreluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had\ngiven myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my\nhereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I\nbegan to murmur,--to hesitate,--to resist. And was it only fancy which\ninduced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that\nof my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution? Be this as it may,\nI now began to feel the inspiration of a burning hope, and at length\nnurtured in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that I\nwould submit no longer to be enslaved.\n\nIt was at Rome, during the Carnival of 18--, that I attended a\nmasquerade in the palazzo of the Neapolitan Duke Di Broglio. I had\nindulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and\nnow the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond\nendurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of\nthe company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for\nI was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the\nyoung, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio.\nWith a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me\nthe secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having\ncaught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her\npresence.--At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder,\nand that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.\n\nIn an absolute phrenzy of wrath, I turned at once upon him who had thus\ninterrupted me, and seized him violently by the collar. He was attired,\nas I had expected, in a costume altogether similar to my own; wearing a\nSpanish cloak of blue velvet, begirt about the waist with a crimson belt\nsustaining a rapier. A mask of black silk entirely covered his face.\n\n\"Scoundrel!\" I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable\nI uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, \"scoundrel! impostor! accursed\nvillain! you shall not--you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I\nstab you where you stand!\"--and I broke my way from the ball-room into\na small ante-chamber adjoining--dragging him unresistingly with me as I\nwent.\n\nUpon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the\nwall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw.\nHe hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in\nsilence, and put himself upon his defence.\n\nThe contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild\nexcitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a\nmultitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the\nwainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with\nbrute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.\n\nAt that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened\nto prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying\nantagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that\nastonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then\npresented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been\nsufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements\nat the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror,--so at first it\nseemed to me in my confusion--now stood where none had been perceptible\nbefore; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own\nimage, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet\nme with a feeble and tottering gait.\n\nThus it appeared, I say, but was not. It was my antagonist--it was\nWilson, who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution.\nHis mask and cloak lay, where he had thrown them, upon the floor. Not\na thread in all his raiment--not a line in all the marked and singular\nlineaments of his face which was not, even in the most absolute\nidentity, mine own!\n\nIt was Wilson; but he spoke no longer in a whisper, and I could have\nfancied that I myself was speaking while he said:\n\n\"You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also\ndead--dead to the World, to Heaven and to Hope! In me didst thou\nexist--and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how\nutterly thou hast murdered thyself.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE TELL-TALE HEART.\n\nTRUE!--nervous--very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but\nwhy will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses--not\ndestroyed--not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I\nheard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things\nin hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily--how\ncalmly I can tell you the whole story.\n\nIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once\nconceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion\nthere was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had\nnever given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his\neye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture--a pale blue eye,\nwith a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and\nso by degrees--very gradually--I made up my mind to take the life of the\nold man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.\n\nNow this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you\nshould have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded--with\nwhat caution--with what foresight--with what dissimulation I went to\nwork! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week\nbefore I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch\nof his door and opened it--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an\nopening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed,\nclosed, that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh,\nyou would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it\nslowly--very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man's\nsleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so\nfar that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have\nbeen so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I\nundid the lantern cautiously--oh, so cautiously--cautiously (for the\nhinges creaked)--I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell\nupon the vulture eye. And this I did for seven long nights--every night\njust at midnight--but I found the eye always closed; and so it was\nimpossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but\nhis Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into\nthe chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a\nhearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he\nwould have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every\nnight, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.\n\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the\ndoor. A watch's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never\nbefore that night had I felt the extent of my own powers--of my\nsagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think\nthat there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to\ndream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and\nperhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled.\nNow you may think that I drew back--but no. His room was as black as\npitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened,\nthrough fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the\nopening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.\n\nI had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb\nslipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying\nout--\"Who's there?\"\n\nI kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a\nmuscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still\nsitting up in the bed listening;--just as I have done, night after\nnight, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.\n\nPresently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal\nterror. It was not a groan of pain or of grief--oh, no!--it was the low\nstifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged\nwith awe. I knew the sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when\nall the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with\nits dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. I say I knew it well.\nI knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although I chuckled at\nheart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight\nnoise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had been ever since\ngrowing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could\nnot. He had been saying to himself--\"It is nothing but the wind in the\nchimney--it is only a mouse crossing the floor,\" or \"It is merely a\ncricket which has made a single chirp.\" Yes, he had been trying to\ncomfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain.\nAll in vain; because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his\nblack shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. And it was the\nmournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to\nfeel--although he neither saw nor heard--to feel the presence of my head\nwithin the room.\n\nWhen I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie\ndown, I resolved to open a little--a very, very little crevice in\nthe lantern. So I opened it--you cannot imagine how stealthily,\nstealthily--until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of the\nspider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.\n\nIt was open--wide, wide open--and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I\nsaw it with perfect distinctness--all a dull blue, with a hideous\nveil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see\nnothing else of the old man's face or person: for I had directed the ray\nas if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.\n\nAnd have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but\nover-acuteness of the sense?--now, I say, there came to my ears a low,\ndull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I\nknew that sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It\nincreased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into\ncourage.\n\nBut even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the\nlantern motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon\nthe eve. Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew\nquicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's\nterror must have been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every\nmoment!--do you mark me well I have told you that I am nervous: so I am.\nAnd now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of\nthat old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable\nterror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained and stood still. But\nthe beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. And now\na new anxiety seized me--the sound would be heard by a neighbour! The\nold man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern\nand leaped into the room. He shrieked once--once only. In an instant\nI dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then\nsmiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the\nheart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it\nwould not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man\nwas dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone,\nstone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many\nminutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would\ntrouble me no more.\n\nIf still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe\nthe wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night\nwaned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered\nthe corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.\n\nI then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and\ndeposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so\ncleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have\ndetected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out--no stain of any\nkind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had\ncaught all--ha! ha!\n\nWhen I had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock--still dark\nas midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the\nstreet door. I went down to open it with a light heart,--for what had\nI now to fear? There entered three men, who introduced themselves, with\nperfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by\na neighbour during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused;\ninformation had been lodged at the police office, and they (the\nofficers) had been deputed to search the premises.\n\nI smiled,--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The\nshriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was\nabsent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade\nthem search--search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I\nshowed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of\nmy confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here\nto rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of\nmy perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which\nreposed the corpse of the victim.\n\nThe officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was\nsingularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they\nchatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale\nand wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my\nears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more\ndistinct:--It continued and became more distinct: I talked more\nfreely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained\ndefiniteness--until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my\nears.\n\nNo doubt I now grew _very_ pale;--but I talked more fluently, and with a\nheightened voice. Yet the sound increased--and what could I do? It was\na low, dull, quick sound--much such a sound as a watch makes when\nenveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath--and yet the officers heard\nit not. I talked more quickly--more vehemently; but the noise steadily\nincreased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with\nviolent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would\nthey not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if\nexcited to fury by the observations of the men--but the noise steadily\nincreased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed--I raved--I swore! I swung\nthe chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the\nboards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It\ngrew louder--louder--louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and\nsmiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!--no, no! They\nheard!--they suspected!--they knew!--they were making a mockery of my\nhorror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than\nthis agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear\nthose hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die!\nand now--again!--hark! louder! louder! louder! louder!\n\n\"Villains!\" I shrieked, \"dissemble no more! I admit the deed!--tear up\nthe planks! here, here!--It is the beating of his hideous heart!\"\n\n\n\n\nBERENICE\n\n     Dicebant mihi sodales, si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas\n     meas aliquantulum forelevatas.\n\n                                 --_Ebn Zaiat_.\n\nMISERY is manifold. The wretchedness of earth is multiform. Overreaching\nthe wide horizon as the rainbow, its hues are as various as the hues of\nthat arch--as distinct too, yet as intimately blended. Overreaching the\nwide horizon as the rainbow! How is it that from beauty I have derived\na type of unloveliness?--from the covenant of peace, a simile of sorrow?\nBut as, in ethics, evil is a consequence of good, so, in fact, out of\njoy is sorrow born. Either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of\nto-day, or the agonies which _are_, have their origin in the ecstasies\nwhich _might have been_.\n\nMy baptismal name is Egaeus; that of my family I will not mention. Yet\nthere are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy, gray,\nhereditary halls. Our line has been called a race of visionaries; and\nin many striking particulars--in the character of the family\nmansion--in the frescos of the chief saloon--in the tapestries of the\ndormitories--in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory--but\nmore especially in the gallery of antique paintings--in the fashion of\nthe library chamber--and, lastly, in the very peculiar nature of the\nlibrary's contents--there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant\nthe belief.\n\nThe recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber,\nand with its volumes--of which latter I will say no more. Here died my\nmother. Herein was I born. But it is mere idleness to say that I had not\nlived before--that the soul has no previous existence. You deny it?--let\nus not argue the matter. Convinced myself, I seek not to convince. There\nis, however, a remembrance of aerial forms--of spiritual and meaning\neyes--of sounds, musical yet sad--a remembrance which will not be\nexcluded; a memory like a shadow--vague, variable, indefinite, unsteady;\nand like a shadow, too, in the impossibility of my getting rid of it\nwhile the sunlight of my reason shall exist.\n\nIn that chamber was I born. Thus awaking from the long night of what\nseemed, but was not, nonentity, at once into the very regions of fairy\nland--into a palace of imagination--into the wild dominions of monastic\nthought and erudition--it is not singular that I gazed around me with a\nstartled and ardent eye--that I loitered away my boyhood in books,\nand dissipated my youth in reverie; but it _is_ singular that as years\nrolled away, and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my\nfathers--it _is_ wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs\nof my life--wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character\nof my commonest thought. The realities of the world affected me as\nvisions, and as visions only, while the wild ideas of the land of dreams\nbecame, in turn, not the material of my every-day existence, but in very\ndeed that existence utterly and solely in itself.\n\n* * * * *\n\nBerenice and I were cousins, and we grew up together in my paternal\nhalls. Yet differently we grew--I, ill of health, and buried in\ngloom--she, agile, graceful, and overflowing with energy; hers, the\nramble on the hill-side--mine the studies of the cloister; I, living\nwithin my own heart, and addicted, body and soul, to the most intense\nand painful meditation--she, roaming carelessly through life, with\nno thought of the shadows in her path, or the silent flight of the\nraven-winged hours. Berenice!--I call upon her name--Berenice!--and\nfrom the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are\nstartled at the sound! Ah, vividly is her image before me now, as in the\nearly days of her light-heartedness and joy! Oh, gorgeous yet fantastic\nbeauty! Oh, sylph amid the shrubberies of Arnheim! Oh, Naiad among its\nfountains! And then--then all is mystery and terror, and a tale which\nshould not be told. Disease--a fatal disease, fell like the simoon upon\nher frame; and, even while I gazed upon her, the spirit of change swept\nover her, pervading her mind, her habits, and her character, and, in a\nmanner the most subtle and terrible, disturbing even the identity of\nher person! Alas! the destroyer came and went!--and the victim--where is\nshe? I knew her not--or knew her no longer as Berenice.\n\nAmong the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and\nprimary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the\nmoral and physical being of my cousin, may be mentioned as the most\ndistressing and obstinate in its nature, a species of epilepsy not\nunfrequently terminating in _trance_ itself--trance very nearly\nresembling positive dissolution, and from which her manner of recovery\nwas in most instances, startlingly abrupt. In the mean time my own\ndisease--for I have been told that I should call it by no other\nappellation--my own disease, then, grew rapidly upon me, and assumed\nfinally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form--hourly\nand momently gaining vigor--and at length obtaining over me the most\nincomprehensible ascendancy. This monomania, if I must so term it,\nconsisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in\nmetaphysical science termed the _attentive_. It is more than probable\nthat I am not understood; but I fear, indeed, that it is in no manner\npossible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader, an adequate\nidea of that nervous _intensity of interest_ with which, in my case,\nthe powers of meditation (not to speak technically) busied and buried\nthemselves, in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of\nthe universe.\n\nTo muse for long unwearied hours, with my attention riveted to some\nfrivolous device on the margin, or in the typography of a book; to\nbecome absorbed, for the better part of a summer's day, in a quaint\nshadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor; to lose\nmyself, for an entire night, in watching the steady flame of a lamp,\nor the embers of a fire; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a\nflower; to repeat, monotonously, some common word, until the sound, by\ndint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the\nmind; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence, by means of\nabsolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in: such\nwere a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a\ncondition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled,\nbut certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation.\n\nYet let me not be misapprehended. The undue, earnest, and morbid\nattention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous, must\nnot be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common\nto all mankind, and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent\nimagination. It was not even, as might be at first supposed, an extreme\ncondition, or exaggeration of such propensity, but primarily and\nessentially distinct and different. In the one instance, the dreamer,\nor enthusiast, being interested by an object usually _not_ frivolous,\nimperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions\nand suggestions issuing therefrom, until, at the conclusion of a day\ndream _often replete with luxury_, he finds the _incitamentum_, or first\ncause of his musings, entirely vanished and forgotten. In my case, the\nprimary object was _invariably frivolous_, although assuming, through\nthe medium of my distempered vision, a refracted and unreal importance.\nFew deductions, if any, were made; and those few pertinaciously\nreturning in upon the original object as a centre. The meditations were\n_never_ pleasurable; and, at the termination of the reverie, the first\ncause, so far from being out of sight, had attained that supernaturally\nexaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease. In\na word, the powers of mind more particularly exercised were, with me, as\nI have said before, the _attentive_, and are, with the day-dreamer, the\n_speculative_.\n\nMy books, at this epoch, if they did not actually serve to irritate the\ndisorder, partook, it will be perceived, largely, in their imaginative\nand inconsequential nature, of the characteristic qualities of the\ndisorder itself. I well remember, among others, the treatise of the\nnoble Italian, Coelius Secundus Curio, \"_De Amplitudine Beati Regni\nDei;_\" St. Austin's great work, the \"City of God;\" and Tertullian's \"_De\nCarne Christi_,\" in which the paradoxical sentence \"_Mortuus est Dei\nfilius; credible est quia ineptum est: et sepultus resurrexit; certum\nest quia impossibile est,_\" occupied my undivided time, for many weeks\nof laborious and fruitless investigation.\n\nThus it will appear that, shaken from its balance only by trivial\nthings, my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by\nPtolemy Hephestion, which steadily resisting the attacks of human\nviolence, and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds, trembled\nonly to the touch of the flower called Asphodel. And although, to\na careless thinker, it might appear a matter beyond doubt, that the\nalteration produced by her unhappy malady, in the _moral_ condition of\nBerenice, would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense\nand abnormal meditation whose nature I have been at some trouble in\nexplaining, yet such was not in any degree the case. In the lucid\nintervals of my infirmity, her calamity, indeed, gave me pain, and,\ntaking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life, I\ndid not fail to ponder, frequently and bitterly, upon the wonder-working\nmeans by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought\nto pass. But these reflections partook not of the idiosyncrasy of\nmy disease, and were such as would have occurred, under similar\ncircumstances, to the ordinary mass of mankind. True to its own\ncharacter, my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling\nchanges wrought in the _physical_ frame of Berenice--in the singular and\nmost appalling distortion of her personal identity.\n\nDuring the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty, most surely I had\nnever loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with\nme, _had never been_ of the heart, and my passions _always were_ of the\nmind. Through the gray of the early morning--among the trellised shadows\nof the forest at noonday--and in the silence of my library at night--she\nhad flitted by my eyes, and I had seen her--not as the living and\nbreathing Berenice, but as the Berenice of a dream; not as a being of\nthe earth, earthy, but as the abstraction of such a being; not as a\nthing to admire, but to analyze; not as an object of love, but as\nthe theme of the most abstruse although desultory speculation. And\n_now_--now I shuddered in her presence, and grew pale at her approach;\nyet, bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition, I called to\nmind that she had loved me long, and, in an evil moment, I spoke to her\nof marriage.\n\nAnd at length the period of our nuptials was approaching, when, upon\nan afternoon in the winter of the year--one of those unseasonably\nwarm, calm, and misty days which are the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon\n(*1),--I sat, (and sat, as I thought, alone,) in the inner apartment of\nthe library. But, uplifting my eyes, I saw that Berenice stood before\nme.\n\nWas it my own excited imagination--or the misty influence of the\natmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the gray\ndraperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillating\nand indistinct an outline? I could not tell. She spoke no word; and\nI--not for worlds could I have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran\nthrough my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a\nconsuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair,\nI remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted\nupon her person. Alas! its emaciation was excessive, and not one vestige\nof the former being lurked in any single line of the contour. My burning\nglances at length fell upon the face.\n\nThe forehead was high, and very pale, and singularly placid; and the\nonce jetty hair fell partially over it, and overshadowed the hollow\ntemples with innumerable ringlets, now of a vivid yellow, and jarring\ndiscordantly, in their fantastic character, with the reigning melancholy\nof the countenance. The eyes were lifeless, and lustreless, and\nseemingly pupilless, and I shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare\nto the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips. They parted; and in a\nsmile of peculiar meaning, _the teeth_ of the changed Berenice disclosed\nthemselves slowly to my view. Would to God that I had never beheld them,\nor that, having done so, I had died!\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe shutting of a door disturbed me, and, looking up, I found that my\ncousin had departed from the chamber. But from the disordered chamber\nof my brain, had not, alas! departed, and would not be driven away,\nthe white and ghastly _spectrum_ of the teeth. Not a speck on their\nsurface--not a shade on their enamel--not an indenture in their\nedges--but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon\nmy memory. I saw them _now_ even more unequivocally than I beheld\nthem _then_. The teeth!--the teeth!--they were here, and there, and\neverywhere, and visibly and palpably before me; long, narrow, and\nexcessively white, with the pale lips writhing about them, as in the\nvery moment of their first terrible development. Then came the full\nfury of my _monomania_, and I struggled in vain against its strange and\nirresistible influence. In the multiplied objects of the external world\nI had no thoughts but for the teeth. For these I longed with a phrenzied\ndesire. All other matters and all different interests became absorbed in\ntheir single contemplation. They--they alone were present to the mental\neye, and they, in their sole individuality, became the essence of\nmy mental life. I held them in every light. I turned them in every\nattitude. I surveyed their characteristics. I dwelt upon their\npeculiarities. I pondered upon their conformation. I mused upon the\nalteration in their nature. I shuddered as I assigned to them in\nimagination a sensitive and sentient power, and even when unassisted by\nthe lips, a capability of moral expression. Of Mademoiselle Salle it\nhas been well said, \"_Que tous ses pas etaient des sentiments_,\" and\nof Berenice I more seriously believed _que toutes ses dents etaient des\nidees_. _Des idees!_--ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me!\n_Des idees!_--ah _therefore_ it was that I coveted them so madly! I felt\nthat their possession could alone ever restore me to peace, in giving me\nback to reason.\n\nAnd the evening closed in upon me thus--and then the darkness came, and\ntarried, and went--and the day again dawned--and the mists of a second\nnight were now gathering around--and still I sat motionless in that\nsolitary room--and still I sat buried in meditation--and still the\n_phantasma_ of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy, as, with\nthe most vivid hideous distinctness, it floated about amid the changing\nlights and shadows of the chamber. At length there broke in upon my\ndreams a cry as of horror and dismay; and thereunto, after a pause,\nsucceeded the sound of troubled voices, intermingled with many low\nmoanings of sorrow or of pain. I arose from my seat, and throwing open\none of the doors of the library, saw standing out in the ante-chamber\na servant maiden, all in tears, who told me that Berenice was--no more!\nShe had been seized with epilepsy in the early morning, and now, at the\nclosing in of the night, the grave was ready for its tenant, and all the\npreparations for the burial were completed.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI found myself sitting in the library, and again sitting there alone. It\nseemed that I had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream.\nI knew that it was now midnight, and I was well aware, that since the\nsetting of the sun, Berenice had been interred. But of that dreary\nperiod which intervened I had no positive, at least no definite\ncomprehension. Yet its memory was replete with horror--horror more\nhorrible from being vague, and terror more terrible from ambiguity. It\nwas a fearful page in the record my existence, written all over with\ndim, and hideous, and unintelligible recollections. I strived to\ndecypher them, but in vain; while ever and anon, like the spirit of a\ndeparted sound, the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed\nto be ringing in my ears. I had done a deed--what was it? I asked myself\nthe question aloud, and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered\nme,--\"_what was it?_\"\n\nOn the table beside me burned a lamp, and near it lay a little box. It\nwas of no remarkable character, and I had seen it frequently before, for\nit was the property of the family physician; but how came it _there_,\nupon my table, and why did I shudder in regarding it? These things were\nin no manner to be accounted for, and my eyes at length dropped to the\nopen pages of a book, and to a sentence underscored therein. The words\nwere the singular but simple ones of the poet Ebn Zaiat:--\"_Dicebant\nmihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum\nfore levatas_.\" Why then, as I perused them, did the hairs of my head\nerect themselves on end, and the blood of my body become congealed\nwithin my veins?\n\nThere came a light tap at the library door--and, pale as the tenant of a\ntomb, a menial entered upon tiptoe. His looks were wild with terror,\nand he spoke to me in a voice tremulous, husky, and very low. What said\nhe?--some broken sentences I heard. He told of a wild cry disturbing the\nsilence of the night--of the gathering together of the household--of\na search in the direction of the sound; and then his tones grew\nthrillingly distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave--of\na disfigured body enshrouded, yet still breathing--still\npalpitating--_still alive_!\n\nHe pointed to garments;--they were muddy and clotted with gore. I spoke\nnot, and he took me gently by the hand: it was indented with the impress\nof human nails. He directed my attention to some object against the\nwall. I looked at it for some minutes: it was a spade. With a shriek I\nbounded to the table, and grasped the box that lay upon it. But I could\nnot force it open; and in my tremor, it slipped from my hands, and fell\nheavily, and burst into pieces; and from it, with a rattling sound,\nthere rolled out some instruments of dental surgery, intermingled with\nthirty-two small, white and ivory-looking substances that were scattered\nto and fro about the floor.\n\n\n\n\nELEONORA\n\n     Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima.\n\n                        _  Raymond Lully_.\n\nI AM come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. Men\nhave called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether\nmadness is or is not the loftiest intelligence--whether much that is\nglorious--whether all that is profound--does not spring from disease\nof thought--from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general\nintellect. They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which\nescape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain\nglimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awakening, to find that they\nhave been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn\nsomething of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge\nwhich is of evil. They penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless\ninto the vast ocean of the \"light ineffable,\" and again, like the\nadventures of the Nubian geographer, \"agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid\nin eo esset exploraturi.\"\n\nWe will say, then, that I am mad. I grant, at least, that there are two\ndistinct conditions of my mental existence--the condition of a lucid\nreason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events\nforming the first epoch of my life--and a condition of shadow and doubt,\nappertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes\nthe second great era of my being. Therefore, what I shall tell of the\nearlier period, believe; and to what I may relate of the later time,\ngive only such credit as may seem due, or doubt it altogether, or, if\ndoubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus.\n\nShe whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and distinctly\nthese remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my\nmother long departed. Eleonora was the name of my cousin. We had\nalways dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the Valley of the\nMany-Colored Grass. No unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for\nit lay away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around\nabout it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. No path\nwas trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was\nneed of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of\nforest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of\nfragrant flowers. Thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing\nof the world without the valley--I, and my cousin, and her mother.\n\nFrom the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our\nencircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than\nall save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy\ncourses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills\nstill dimmer than those whence it had issued. We called it the \"River\nof Silence\"; for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.\nNo murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the\npearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom,\nstirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old\nstation, shining on gloriously forever.\n\nThe margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided\nthrough devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that\nextended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until\nthey reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom,--these spots, not less\nthan the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains\nthat girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick,\nshort, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled\nthroughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple\nviolet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to\nour hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God.\n\nAnd, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of\ndreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not\nupright, but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noon-day\ninto the centre of the valley. Their mark was speckled with the vivid\nalternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save\nthe cheeks of Eleonora; so that, but for the brilliant green of the huge\nleaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying\nwith the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of Syria\ndoing homage to their sovereign the Sun.\n\nHand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I with\nEleonora before Love entered within our hearts. It was one evening at\nthe close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own,\nthat we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath the serpent-like\ntrees, and looked down within the water of the River of Silence at our\nimages therein. We spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day, and\nour words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. We had drawn the\nGod Eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us\nthe fiery souls of our forefathers. The passions which had for centuries\ndistinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they\nhad been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over\nthe Valley of the Many-Colored Grass. A change fell upon all things.\nStrange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burn out upon the trees\nwhere no flowers had been known before. The tints of the green carpet\ndeepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there\nsprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. And\nlife arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with\nall gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. The\ngolden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which\nissued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a\nlulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus-sweeter than\nall save the voice of Eleonora. And now, too, a voluminous cloud, which\nwe had long watched in the regions of Hesper, floated out thence, all\ngorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day\nby day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the\nmountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us\nup, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory.\n\nThe loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she was a\nmaiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the\nflowers. No guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart,\nand she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together\nin the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass, and discoursed of the mighty\nchanges which had lately taken place therein.\n\nAt length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change\nwhich must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one\nsorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs\nof the bard of Schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and\nagain, in every impressive variation of phrase.\n\nShe had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom--that, like the\nephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but\nthe terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she\nrevealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the River of\nSilence. She grieved to think that, having entombed her in the Valley\nof the Many-Colored Grass, I would quit forever its happy recesses,\ntransferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some\nmaiden of the outer and everyday world. And, then and there, I threw\nmyself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and offered up a vow, to\nherself and to Heaven, that I would never bind myself in marriage to any\ndaughter of Earth--that I would in no manner prove recreant to her dear\nmemory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had\nblessed me. And I called the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the\npious solemnity of my vow. And the curse which I invoked of Him and\nof her, a saint in Helusion should I prove traitorous to that promise,\ninvolved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit\nme to make record of it here. And the bright eyes of Eleonora grew\nbrighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been\ntaken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she\nmade acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made\neasy to her the bed of her death. And she said to me, not many days\nafterward, tranquilly dying, that, because of what I had done for\nthe comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when\ndeparted, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the\nwatches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power\nof the souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent\nindications of her presence, sighing upon me in the evening winds, or\nfilling the air which I breathed with perfume from the censers of the\nangels. And, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent\nlife, putting an end to the first epoch of my own.\n\nThus far I have faithfully said. But as I pass the barrier in Time's\npath, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second\nera of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and I\nmistrust the perfect sanity of the record. But let me on.--Years dragged\nthemselves along heavily, and still I dwelled within the Valley of the\nMany-Colored Grass; but a second change had come upon all things. The\nstar-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no\nmore. The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red\nasphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten\nby ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever\nencumbered with dew. And Life departed from our paths; for the tall\nflamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew\nsadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that\nhad arrived in his company. And the golden and silver fish swam down\nthrough the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet\nriver never again. And the lulling melody that had been softer than\nthe wind-harp of Aeolus, and more divine than all save the voice of\nEleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and\nlower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity\nof its original silence. And then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose,\nand, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell\nback into the regions of Hesper, and took away all its manifold golden\nand gorgeous glories from the Valley of the Many-Colored Grass.\n\nYet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard the sounds\nof the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy\nperfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when\nmy heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden\nwith soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air, and\nonce--oh, but once only! I was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber\nof death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own.\n\nBut the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. I longed\nfor the love which had before filled it to overflowing. At length the\nvalley pained me through its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for\never for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world.\n\nI found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served\nto blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had dreamed so long in the\nValley of the Many-Colored Grass. The pomps and pageantries of a stately\ncourt, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of women,\nbewildered and intoxicated my brain. But as yet my soul had proved true\nto its vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still\ngiven me in the silent hours of the night. Suddenly these manifestations\nthey ceased, and the world grew dark before mine eyes, and I stood\naghast at the burning thoughts which possessed, at the terrible\ntemptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant\nand unknown land, into the gay court of the king I served, a maiden to\nwhose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once--at whose footstool\nI bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject\nworship of love. What, indeed, was my passion for the young girl of\nthe valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the\nspirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole\nsoul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde?--Oh, bright\nwas the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had room for none\nother.--Oh, divine was the angel Ermengarde! and as I looked down into\nthe depths of her memorial eyes, I thought only of them--and of her.\n\nI wedded;--nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its bitterness was\nnot visited upon me. And once--but once again in the silence of the\nnight; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken\nme; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying:\n\n\"Sleep in peace!--for the Spirit of Love reigneth and ruleth, and, in\ntaking to thy passionate heart her who is Ermengarde, thou art absolved,\nfor reasons which shall be made known to thee in Heaven, of thy vows\nunto Eleonora.\"\n\n\n\n\nNOTES TO THIS VOLUME\n\nNotes -- Scheherezade\n\n(*1) The coralites.\n\n(*2) \"One of the most remarkable natural curiosities in Texas is a\npetrified forest, near the head of Pasigno river. It consists of several\nhundred trees, in an erect position, all turned to stone. Some trees,\nnow growing, are partly petrified. This is a startling fact for natural\nphilosophers, and must cause them to modify the existing theory of\npetrification.--_Kennedy_.\n\nThis account, at first discredited, has since been corroborated by the\ndiscovery of a completely petrified forest, near the head waters of the\nCheyenne, or Chienne river, which has its source in the Black Hills of\nthe rocky chain.\n\nThere is scarcely, perhaps, a spectacle on the surface of the globe more\nremarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than\nthat presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller,\nhaving passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the\ncity, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road\nacross the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up\na low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as\nif the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills,\nwhich has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now\npresented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of\nfragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by his\nhorse's hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles\nand miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest.\nThe wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, the\npieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to\nthree feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye\ncan reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through\namongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it\nmight pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the\nexhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the\nbranches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes\neaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of the\nsap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, are\nperfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest magnifiers.\nThe whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are\ncapable of receiving the highest polish.-- _Asiatic Magazine_.\n\n(*3) The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky.\n\n(*4) In Iceland, 1783.\n\n(*5) \"During the eruption of Hecla, in 1766, clouds of this kind\nproduced such a degree of darkness that, at Glaumba, which is more than\nfifty leagues from the mountain, people could only find their way by\ngroping.

This most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the\n_Rota_ and _Ferriri_ trees, and entering into the top, eats its way,\nperforating the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root, and dies,\nor remains dormant, and the plant propagates out of its head; the body\nremains perfect and entire, of a harder substance than when alive. From\nthis insect the natives make a coloring for tattooing.\n\n(*13) In mines and natural caves we find a species of cryptogamous\n_fungus_ that emits an intense phosphorescence.\n\n(*14) The orchis, scabius and valisneria.\n\n(*15) The corolla of this flower (_Aristolochia Clematitis_), which is\ntubular, but terminating upwards in a ligulate limb, is inflated into a\nglobular figure at the base. The tubular part is internally beset with\nstiff hairs, pointing downwards. The globular part contains the\npistil, which consists merely of a germen and stigma, together with the\nsurrounding stamens. But the stamens, being shorter than the germen,\ncannot discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the\nflower stands always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without\nsome additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily fan down\nto the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature has furnished in\nthis case, is that of the _Tiputa Pennicornis_, a small insect, which\nentering the tube of the corrolla in quest of honey, descends to the\nbottom, and rummages about till it becomes quite covered with pollen;\nbut not being able to force its way out again, owing to the downward\nposition of the hairs, which converge to a point like the wires of a\nmouse-trap, and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes\nbackwards and forwards, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly\ntraversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its\nimpregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop,\nand the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube, effecting an easy\npassage for the escape of the insect.\"--_Rev. P. Keith-System of\nPhysiological Botany_.\n\n(*16) The bees--ever since bees were--have been constructing their\ncells with just such sides, in just such number, and at just such\ninclinations, as it has been demonstrated (in a problem involving the\nprofoundest mathematical principles) are the very sides, in the very\nnumber, and at the very angles, which will afford the creatures the most\nroom that is compatible with the greatest stability of structure.\n\nDuring the latter part of the last century, the question arose among\nmathematicians--\"to determine the best form that can be given to the\nsails of a windmill, according to their varying distances from the\nrevolving vanes, and likewise from the centres of the revoloution.\" This\nis an excessively complex problem, for it is, in other words, to find\nthe best possible position at an infinity of varied distances and at an\ninfinity of points on the arm. There were a thousand futile attempts to\nanswer the query on the part of the most illustrious mathematicians, and\nwhen at length, an undeniable solution was discovered, men found that\nthe wings of a bird had given it with absolute precision ever since the\nfirst bird had traversed the air.\n\n(*17) He observed a flock of pigeons passing betwixt Frankfort and the\nIndian territory, one mile at least in breadth; it took up four hours\nin passing, which, at the rate of one mile per minute, gives a length\nof 240 miles; and, supposing three pigeons to each square yard, gives\n2,230,272,000 Pigeons.--\"_Travels in Canada and the United States,\" by\nLieut.

If two red rays from two\nluminous points be admitted into a dark chamber so as to fall on a\nwhite surface, and differ in their length by 0.0000258 of an inch,\ntheir intensity is doubled. So also if the difference in length be any\nwhole-number multiple of that fraction. A multiple by 2 1/4, 3 1/4, &c.,\ngives an intensity equal to one ray only; but a multiple by 2 1/2, 3\n1/2, &c., gives the result of total darkness. In violet rays similar\neffects arise when the difference in length is 0.000157 of an inch; and\nwith all other rays the results are the same--the difference varying\nwith a uniform increase from the violet to the red.\n\n\"Analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results.\"\n\n(*32) Place a platina crucible over a spirit lamp, and keep it a red\nheat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of\nbodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed\nin a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates--being surrounded by an\natmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few\ndrops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming in\ncontact with the heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous\nacid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water\npasses off with it, which falls a lump of ice to the bottom; by taking\nadvantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned\nout a lump of ice from a red-hot vessel.\n\n(*33) The Daguerreotype.\n\n(*34) Although light travels 167,000 miles in a second, the distance\nof 61 Cygni (the only star whose distance is ascertained) is so\ninconceivably great, that its rays would require more than ten years to\nreach the earth. For stars beyond this, 20--or even 1000 years--would\nbe a moderate estimate. Thus, if they had been annihilated 20, or 1000\nyears ago, we might still see them to-day by the light which started\nfrom their surfaces 20 or 1000 years in the past time. That many which\nwe see daily are really extinct, is not impossible--not even improbable.\n\nNotes--Maelstrom\n\n(*1) See Archimedes, \"_De Incidentibus in Fluido_.\"--lib. 2.\n\nNotes--Island of the Fay\n\n(*1) Moraux is here derived from moeurs, and its meaning is\n\"fashionable\" or more strictly \"of manners.\"\n\n(*2) Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise \"De Situ\nOrbis,\" says \"either the world is a great animal, or\" etc\n\n(*3) Balzac--in substance--I do not remember the words\n\n(*4) Florem putares nare per liquidum aethera.--P.
