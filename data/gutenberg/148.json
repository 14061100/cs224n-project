{"summary": "\nPart One of the Autobiography is addressed to Franklin's son William, at that time (1771) Royal Governor of New Jersey. While in England at the estate of the Bishop of St Asaph in Twyford, Franklin, now 65 years old, begins by saying that it may be agreeable to his son to know some of the incidents of his father's life; so with a week's uninterrupted leisure, he is beginning to write them down for William. He starts with some anecdotes of his grandfather, uncles, father and mother. He deals with his childhood, his fondness for reading, and his service as an apprentice to his brother James Franklin, a Boston printer and the publisher of the New England Courant. After improving his writing skills through study of the Spectator by Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, he writes an anonymous paper and slips it under the door of the printing house by night. Not knowing its author, James and his friends praise the paper and it is published in the Courant, which encourages Ben to produce more essays (the \"Silence Dogood\" essays) which are also published. When Ben reveals his authorship, James is angered, thinking the recognition of his papers will make Ben too vain. James and Ben have frequent disputes and Ben seeks for a way to escape from working under James.\nEventually James gets in trouble with the colonial assembly, which jails him for a short time and then forbids him to continue publishing his paper. James and his friends come up with the stratagem that the Courant should hereafter be published under the name of Benjamin Franklin, although James will still actually be in control. James signs a discharge of Ben's apprenticeship papers but writes up new private indenture papers for Ben to sign which will secure Ben's service for the remainder of the agreed time. But when a fresh disagreement arises between the brothers, Ben chooses to leave James, correctly judging that James will not dare to produce the secret indenture papers. (\"It was not fair in me to take this Advantage,\" Franklin comments, \"and this I therefore reckon one of the first Errata of my life.\") James does, however, make it impossible for Ben to get work anywhere else in Boston. Sneaking onto a ship without his father's or brother's knowledge, Ben heads for New York, but the printer William Bradford is unable to employ him; however, he tells Ben that his son Andrew, a Philadelphia printer, may be able to use him since one of his son's principal employees had just died.\nBy the time Ben reaches Philadelphia, Andrew Bradford has already replaced his employee, but refers Ben to Samuel Keimer, another printer in the city, who is able to give him work. The Governor, Sir William Keith, takes notice of Franklin and offers to set him up in business for himself. On Keith's recommendation, Franklin goes to London for printing supplies, but when he arrives, he finds that Keith has not written the promised letter of recommendation for him, and that \"no one who knew him had the smallest Dependence on him.\" Franklin finds work in London until an opportunity arises of returning to Philadelphia as an assistant to Thomas Denham, a Quaker merchant; but when Denham takes ill and dies, he returns to manage Keimer's shop. Keimer soon comes to feel that Franklin's wages are too high and provokes a quarrel which causes the latter to quit. At this point a fellow employee, Hugh Meredith, suggests that Franklin and he set up a partnership to start a printing shop of their own; this is subsidized by funds from Meredith's father, though most of the work is done by Franklin as Meredith is not much of a press worker and is given to drinking.\nThey establish their business, and plan to start a newspaper, but when Keimer hears of this plan, he rushes out a paper of his own, the Pennsylvania Gazette. This publication limps along for three quarters of a year before Franklin buys the paper from Keimer and makes it \"extremely profitable.\" (The Saturday Evening Post traces its lineage to Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette.) The partnership also receives an appointment as printer for the Pennsylvania assembly. When Hugh Meredith's father experiences financial setbacks and cannot continue backing the partnership, two friends separately offer to lend Franklin the money he needs to stay in business; the partnership amicably dissolves as Meredith goes to North Carolina, and Franklin takes from each friend half the needed sum, continuing his business in his own name. In 1730 he marries Deborah Read, and after this, with the help of the Junto, he draws up proposals for Library Company of Philadelphia. At this point Part One breaks off, with a memo in Franklin's writing noting that \"The Affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the Interruption\".\n\nThe second part begins with two letters Franklin received in the early 1780s while in Paris, encouraging him to continue the Autobiography, of which both correspondents have read Part One. (Although Franklin does not say so, there had been a breach with his son William after the writing of Part One, since the father had sided with the Revolutionaries and the son had remained loyal to the British Crown.)\nAt Passy, a suburb of Paris, Franklin begins Part Two in 1784, giving a more detailed account of his public library plan. He then discusses his \"bold and arduous Project of arriving at moral Perfection\", listing thirteen virtues he wishes to perfect in himself. He creates a book with columns for each day of the week, in which he marks with black spots his offenses against each virtue. Of these virtues, he notices that Order is the hardest for him to keep. He eventually realizes that perfection is not to be attained, but feels himself better and happier because of his attempt.\n\nBeginning in August 1788 when Franklin had returned to Philadelphia, the author says he will not be able to utilize his papers as much as he had expected, since many were lost in the recent Revolutionary War. He has, however, found and quotes a couple of his writings from the 1730s that survived. One is the \"Substance of an intended Creed\" consisting of what he then considered to be the \"Essentials\" of all religions. He had intended this as a basis for a projected sect but, Franklin says, did not pursue the project.\nIn 1732, Franklin first publishes his Poor Richard's Almanac, which becomes very successful. He also continues his profitable newspaper. In 1734, a preacher named Rev. Samuel Hemphill arrives from County Tyrone Ireland; Franklin supports him and writes pamphlets on his behalf. However, someone finds out that Hemphill has been plagiarizing portions of his sermons from others, although Franklin rationalizes this by saying he would rather hear good sermons taken from others than poor sermons of the man's own composition.\nFranklin studies languages, reconciles with his brother James, and loses a four-year-old son to smallpox. Franklin's club, the Junto, grows and breaks up into subordinate clubs. Franklin becomes Clerk of the General Assembly in 1736, and the following year becomes Comptroller to the Postmaster General, which makes it easier to get reports and fulfill subscriptions for his newspaper. He proposes improvements to the city' watch and fire prevention regulations.\nThe famed preacher George Whitefield arrives in 1739, and despite significant differences in their religious beliefs, Franklin assists Whitefield by printing his sermons and journals and lodging him in his house. As Franklin continues to succeed, he provides the capital for several of his workers to start printing houses of their own in other colonies. He makes further proposals for the public good, including some for the defense of Pennsylvania, which cause him to contend with the pacifist position of the Quakers.\nIn 1740 he invents the Franklin stove, refusing a patent on the device because it was for \"the good of the people\". He proposes an academy, which opens after money is raised by subscription for it and it expands so much that a new building has to be constructed for it. Franklin obtains other governmental positions (city councilman, alderman, burgess, justice of the peace) and helps negotiate a treaty with the Indians. After helping Dr. Thomas Bond establish a hospital, he helps pave the streets of Philadelphia and draws up a proposal for Dr. John Fothergill about doing the same in London. In 1753 Franklin becomes Deputy Postmaster General.\nThe next year, as war with the French is expected, representatives of the several colonies, including Franklin, meet with the Indians to discuss defense; Franklin at this time draws up a proposal for the union of the colonies, but it is not adopted. General Braddock arrives with two regiments, and Franklin helps him secure wagons and horses, but the general refuses to take Ben's warning about danger from hostile Indians during Braddock's planned march to Frontenac (now Kingston, Ontario). When Braddock's troops are subsequently attacked, the general is mortally wounded and his forces abandon their supplies and flee.\nA militia is formed on the basis of a proposal by Benjamin Franklin, and the governor asks him to take command of the northwestern frontier. With his son as aide de camp, Franklin heads for Gnadenhut, raising men for the militia and building forts. Returning to Philadelphia, he is chosen colonel of the regiment; his officers honor him by personally escorting him out of town. This attention offends the proprietor of the colony (Thomas Penn, son of William Penn) when someone writes an account of it in a letter to him, whereupon the proprietor complains to the government in England about Franklin.\nNow the Autobiography discusses \"the Rise and Progress of [Franklin's] Philosophical Reputation.\" He starts experiments with electricity and writes letters about them that are published in England as a book. Franklin's description of his experiments is translated into French, and Abb√© Nollet, who is offended because this work calls into question his own theory of electricity, publishes his own book of letters attacking Franklin. Declining to respond on the grounds that anyone could duplicate and thus verify his experiments, Franklin sees another French author refute Nollet, and as Franklin's book is translated into other languages, its views are gradually accepted and Nollet's are discarded. Franklin is also voted an honorary member of the Royal Society.\nA new governor arrives, but disputes between the assembly and the governor continue. (Since the colonial governors are bound to fulfill the instructions issued by the colony's proprietor, there is a continuing struggle for power between the legislature and the governor and proprietor.) The assembly is on the verge of sending Franklin to England to petition the King against the governor and proprietor, but meanwhile Lord Loudoun arrives on behalf of the English government to mediate the differences. Franklin nevertheless goes to England accompanied by his son, after stopping at New York and making an unsuccessful attempt to be recompensed by Loudoun for his outlay of funds during his militia service. They arrive in England on July 27, 1757.\n\nWritten sometime between November 1789 and Franklin's death on April 17, 1790, this section is very brief. After Franklin and his son arrive in London, the former is counselled by Dr. Fothergill on the best way to advocate his cause on behalf of the colonies. Franklin visits Lord Granville, president of the King's Privy Council, who asserts that the king is the legislator of the colonies. Franklin then meets the proprietaries (the switch to the plural is Franklin's, so apparently others besides Thomas Penn are involved). But the respective sides are far from any kind of agreement. The proprietaries ask Franklin to write a summary of the colonists' complaints; when he does so, their solicitor for reasons of personal enmity delays a response. Over a year later, the proprietaries finally respond to the assembly, regarding the summary to be a \"flimsy Justification of their Conduct.\" During this delay the assembly has prevailed on the governor to pass a taxation act, and Franklin defends the act in English court so that it can receive royal assent. While the assembly thanks Franklin, the proprietaries, enraged at the governor, turn him out and threaten legal action against him; in the last sentence, Franklin tells us the governor \"despis'd the Threats, and they were never put in Execution\".\n\n", "full_text": "THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nWITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES\n\nEDITED BY CHARLES W ELIOT LLD\n\nP F COLLIER & SON COMPANY, NEW YORK (1909)\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\n\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN was born in Milk Street, Boston, on January 6, 1706.\nHis father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler who married twice,\nand of his seventeen children Benjamin was the youngest son.  His\nschooling ended at ten, and at twelve he was bound apprentice to his\nbrother James, a printer, who published the \"New England Courant.\" To\nthis journal he became a contributor, and later was for a time its\nnominal editor. But the brothers quarreled, and Benjamin ran away,\ngoing first to New York, and thence to Philadelphia, where he arrived\nin October, 1723.  He soon obtained work as a printer, but after a few\nmonths he was induced by Governor Keith to go to London, where, finding\nKeith's promises empty, he again worked as a compositor till he was\nbrought back to Philadelphia by a merchant named  Denman, who gave him\na position in his business. On Denman's death he returned to his former\ntrade, and shortly set up a printing house of his own from which he\npublished \"The Pennsylvania Gazette,\" to which he contributed many\nessays, and which he made a medium for agitating a variety of local\nreforms. In 1732 he began to issue his famous \"Poor Richard's Almanac\"\nfor the enrichment of which he borrowed or composed those pithy\nutterances of worldly wisdom which are the basis of a large part of his\npopular reputation.  In 1758, the year in which he ceases writing for\nthe Almanac, he printed in it \"Father Abraham's Sermon,\" now regarded\nas the most famous piece of literature produced in Colonial America.\n\nMeantime Franklin was concerning himself more and more with public\naffairs.  He set forth a scheme for an Academy, which was taken up\nlater and finally developed into the University of Pennsylvania; and he\nfounded an \"American Philosophical Society\" for the purpose of enabling\nscientific  men to communicate their discoveries to one another.  He\nhimself had already begun his electrical researches, which, with other\nscientific inquiries, he called on in the intervals of money-making and\npolitics to the end of his life.  In 1748 he sold his business in order\nto get leisure for study, having now acquired comparative wealth; and\nin a few years he had made discoveries that gave him a reputation with\nthe learned throughout Europe.  In politics he proved very able both as\nan administrator and as a controversialist; but his record as an\noffice-holder is stained by the use he made of his position to advance\nhis relatives.  His most notable service in home politics was his\nreform of the postal system; but his fame as a statesman rests chiefly\non his services in connection with the relations of the Colonies with\nGreat Britain, and later with France.  In 1757 he was sent to England\nto protest against the influence of the Penns in the government of the\ncolony, and for five years he remained there, striving to enlighten the\npeople and the ministry of England as to Colonial conditions.  On his\nreturn to America he played an honorable part in the Paxton affair,\nthrough which he lost his seat in the Assembly; but in 1764 he was\nagain despatched to England as agent for the colony, this time to\npetition the King to resume the government from the hands of the\nproprietors.  In London he actively opposed the proposed Stamp Act, but\nlost the credit for this and much of his popularity through his\nsecuring for a friend the office of stamp agent in America.  Even his\neffective work in helping to obtain the repeal of the act left him\nstill a suspect; but he continued his efforts to present the case for\nthe Colonies as the troubles thickened toward the crisis of the\nRevolution.  In 1767 he crossed to France, where he was received with\nhonor; but before his return home in 1775 he lost his position as\npostmaster through his share in divulging to Massachusetts the famous\nletter of Hutchinson and Oliver.  On his arrival in Philadelphia he was\nchosen a member of the Continental Congress and in 1777 he was\ndespatched to France as commissioner for the United States.  Here he\nremained till 1785, the favorite of French society; and with such\nsuccess did he conduct the affairs of his country that when he finally\nreturned he received a place only second to that of Washington as the\nchampion of American independence.  He died on April 17, 1790.\n\nThe first five chapters of the Autobiography were composed in England\nin 1771, continued in 1784-5, and again in 1788, at which date he\nbrought it down to 1757.  After a most extraordinary series of\nadventures, the original form of the manuscript was finally printed by\nMr. John Bigelow, and is here reproduced in recognition of its value as\na picture of one of the most notable personalities of Colonial times,\nand of its acknowledged rank as one of the great autobiographies of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\nBENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\nHIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\n\n1706-1757\n\n\n\nTWYFORD, at the Bishop of St. Asaph's,[0]  1771.\n\n     [0] The country-seat of Bishop Shipley, the good bishop,\n         as Dr. Franklin used to style him.--B.\n\nDEAR SON:  I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes\nof my ancestors.  You may remember the inquiries I made among the\nremains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the\njourney I undertook for that purpose.  Imagining it may be equally\nagreeable to[1] you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which\nyou are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's\nuninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to\nwrite them for you.  To which I have besides some other inducements.\nHaving emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and\nbred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the\nworld, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of\nfelicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the blessing of\nGod so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as they may find\nsome of them suitable to their own situations, and therefore fit to be\nimitated.\n\n     [1] After the words \"agreeable to\" the words \"some of\" were\n         interlined and afterward effaced.--B.\n\nThat felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to say,\nthat were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to a\nrepetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the\nadvantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of\nthe first.  So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some\nsinister accidents and events of it for others more favorable.  But\nthough this were denied, I should still accept the offer.  Since such a\nrepetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living one's\nlife over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to make\nthat recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in writing.\n\nHereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to\nbe talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall\nindulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to\nage, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since this\nmay be read or not as any one pleases.  And, lastly (I may as well\nconfess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps\nI shall a good deal gratify my own vanity.  Indeed, I scarce ever heard\nor saw the introductory words, \"Without vanity I may say,\" &c., but\nsome vain thing immediately followed.  Most people dislike vanity in\nothers, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I give it fair\nquarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it is often\nproductive of good to the possessor, and to others that are within his\nsphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would not be\naltogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity among the\nother comforts of life.\n\nAnd now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to\nacknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His\nkind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them\nsuccess.  My belief of this induces me to hope, though I must not\npresume, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me, in\ncontinuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,\nwhich I may experience as others have done:  the complexion of my\nfuture fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless to\nus even our afflictions.\n\nThe notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in\ncollecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with\nseveral particulars relating to our ancestors.  From these notes I\nlearned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in\nNorthamptonshire, for three hundred years, and how much longer he knew\nnot (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before was\nthe name of an order of people, was assumed by them as a surname when\nothers took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold of about\nthirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had continued in the\nfamily till his time, the eldest son being always bred to that\nbusiness; a custom which he and my father followed as to their eldest\nsons.  When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an account of\ntheir births, marriages and burials from the year 1555 only, there\nbeing no registers kept in that parish at any time preceding.  By that\nregister I perceived that I was the youngest son of the youngest son\nfor five generations back.  My grandfather Thomas, who was born in\n1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow business longer,\nwhen he went to live with his son John, a dyer at Banbury, in\nOxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.  There my\ngrandfather died and lies buried.  We saw his gravestone in 1758.  His\neldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it with the\nland to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband, one Fisher,\nof Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the manor there.\nMy grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas, John, Benjamin\nand Josiah.  I will give you what account I can of them, at this\ndistance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my absence, you\nwill among them find many more particulars.\n\nThomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and\nencouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,\nthen the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for\nthe business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county; was\na chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county or\ntown of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances were\nrelated of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the then\nLord Halifax.  He died in 1702, January 6, old style, just four years\nto a day before I was born.  The account we received of his life and\ncharacter from some old people at Ecton, I remember, struck you as\nsomething extraordinary, from its similarity to what you knew of mine.\n\n\"Had he died on the same day,\" you said, \"one might have supposed a\ntransmigration.\"\n\nJohn was bred a dyer, I believe of woolens.  Benjamin was bred a silk\ndyer, serving an apprenticeship at London.  He was an ingenious man.  I\nremember him well, for when I was a boy he came over to my father in\nBoston, and lived in the house with us some years.  He lived to a great\nage.  His grandson, Samuel Franklin, now lives in Boston.  He left\nbehind him two quarto volumes, MS., of his own poetry, consisting of\nlittle occasional pieces addressed to his friends and relations, of\nwhich the following, sent to me, is a specimen.[2] He had formed a\nshort-hand of his own, which he taught me, but, never practising it, I\nhave now forgot it.  I was named after this uncle, there being a\nparticular affection between him and my father.  He was very pious, a\ngreat attender of sermons of the best preachers, which he took down in\nhis short-hand, and had with him many volumes of them.  He was also\nmuch of a politician; too much, perhaps, for his station.  There fell\nlately into my hands, in London, a collection he had made of all the\nprincipal pamphlets, relating to public affairs, from 1641 to 1717;\nmany of the volumes are wanting as appears by the numbering, but there\nstill remain eight volumes in folio, and twenty-four in quarto and in\noctavo.  A dealer in old books met with them, and knowing me by my\nsometimes buying of him, he brought them to me.  It seems my uncle must\nhave left them here, when he went to America, which was about fifty\nyears since.  There are many of his notes in the margins.\n\n     [2] Here follow in the margin the words, in brackets, \"here\n         insert it,\" but the poetry is not given.  Mr. Sparks\n         informs us (Life of Franklin, p. 6) that these volumes\n         had been preserved, and were in possession of Mrs. Emmons,\n         of Boston, great-granddaughter of their author.\n\nThis obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued\nProtestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes\nin danger of trouble on account of their zeal against popery.  They had\ngot an English Bible, and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened\nopen with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my\ngreat-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the\njoint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the\ntapes.  One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw\nthe apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court.  In\nthat case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible\nremained concealed under it as before.  This anecdote I had from my\nuncle Benjamin.  The family continued all of the Church of England till\nabout the end of Charles the Second's reign, when some of the ministers\nthat had been outed for nonconformity holding conventicles in\nNorthamptonshire, Benjamin and Josiah adhered to them, and so continued\nall their lives: the rest of the family remained with the Episcopal\nChurch.\n\nJosiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three\nchildren into New England, about 1682.  The conventicles having been\nforbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable\nmen of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed\nwith to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode\nof religion with freedom.  By the same wife he had four children more\nborn there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I\nremember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to\nbe men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest\nchild but two, and was born in Boston, New England.  My mother, the\nsecond wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the\nfirst settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by\nCotton Mather in his church history of that country, entitled Magnalia\nChristi Americana, as \"a godly, learned Englishman,\" if I remember the\nwords rightly.  I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional\npieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years\nsince.  It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and\npeople, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there.\nIt was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the\nBaptists, Quakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution,\nascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the\ncountry, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so\nheinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws.\nThe whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent\nplainness and manly freedom.  The six concluding lines I remember,\nthough I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of\nthem was, that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore,\nhe would be known to be the author.\n\n          \"Because to be a libeller (says he)\n          I hate it with my heart;\n          From Sherburne town, where now I dwell\n          My name I do put here;\n          Without offense your real friend,\n          It is Peter Folgier.\"\n\nMy elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades.  I was\nput to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending to\ndevote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church.  My\nearly readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early,\nas I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his\nfriends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in\nthis purpose of his.  My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and\nproposed to give me all his short-hand volumes of sermons, I suppose as\na stock to set up with, if I would learn his character.  I continued,\nhowever, at the grammar-school not quite one year, though in that time\nI had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be\nthe head of it, and farther was removed into the next class above it,\nin order to go with that into the third at the end of the year.  But my\nfather, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college\neducation, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and\nthe mean living many so educated were afterwards able to\nobtain--reasons that he gave to his friends in my hearing--altered his\nfirst intention, took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a\nschool for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr.\nGeorge Brownell, very successful in his profession generally, and that\nby mild, encouraging methods.  Under him I acquired fair writing pretty\nsoon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it.  At\nten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business,\nwhich was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was\nnot bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on\nfinding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little\nrequest.  Accordingly, I was employed in cutting wick for the candles,\nfilling the dipping mold and the molds for cast candles, attending the\nshop, going of errands, etc.\n\nI disliked the trade, and had a strong inclination for the sea, but my\nfather declared against it; however, living near the water, I was much\nin and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage boats; and\nwhen in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was commonly allowed to\ngovern, especially in any case of difficulty; and upon other occasions\nI was generally a leader among the boys, and sometimes led them into\nscrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early\nprojecting public spirit, tho' not then justly conducted.\n\nThere was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge\nof which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows.  By much\ntrampling, we had made it a mere quagmire.  My proposal was to build a\nwharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large\nheap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and\nwhich would very well suit our purpose.  Accordingly, in the evening,\nwhen the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows,\nand working with them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or\nthree to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff.\nThe next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones,\nwhich were found in our wharff.  Inquiry was made after the removers;\nwe were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by\nour fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine\nconvinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.\n\nI think you may like to know something of his person and character.  He\nhad an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well\nset, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was\nskilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when\nhe played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimes\ndid in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was\nextremely agreeable to hear.  He had a mechanical genius too, and, on\noccasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his\ngreat excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in\nprudential matters, both in private and publick affairs.  In the\nlatter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to\neducate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to\nhis trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading\npeople, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of\nthe church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his\njudgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons\nabout their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen\nan arbitrator between contending parties.\n\nAt his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible\nfriend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some\ningenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve\nthe minds of his children.  By this means he turned our attention to\nwhat was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or\nno notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table,\nwhether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad\nflavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind,\nso that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters\nas to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so\nunobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a\nfew hours after dinner what I dined upon.  This has been a convenience\nto me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very\nunhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate,\nbecause better instructed, tastes and appetites.\n\nMy mother had likewise an excellent constitution:  she suckled all her\nten children.  I never knew either my father or mother to have any\nsickness but that of which they dy'd, he at 89, and she at 85 years of\nage.  They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years since\nplaced a marble over their grave, with this inscription:\n\n                        JOSIAH FRANKLIN,\n                               and\n                         ABIAH his Wife,\n                       lie here interred.\n             They lived lovingly together in wedlock\n                        fifty-five years.\n          Without an estate, or any gainful employment,\n                 By constant labor and industry,\n                      with God's blessing,\n                 They maintained a large family\n                          comfortably,\n                and brought up thirteen children\n                     and seven grandchildren\n                           reputably.\n                   From this instance, reader,\n           Be encouraged to diligence in thy calling,\n                  And distrust not Providence.\n                 He was a pious and prudent man;\n               She, a discreet and virtuous woman.\n                       Their youngest son,\n                In filial regard to their memory,\n                       Places this stone.\n              J.F. born 1655, died 1744, AEtat 89.\n              A.F. born 1667, died 1752, ----- 95.\n\n\nBy my rambling digressions I perceive myself to be grown old.  I us'd\nto write more methodically.  But one does not dress for private company\nas for a publick ball.  'Tis perhaps only negligence.\n\nTo return:  I continued thus employed in my father's business for two\nyears, that is, till I was twelve years old; and my brother John, who\nwas bred to that business, having left my father, married, and set up\nfor himself at Rhode Island, there was all appearance that I was\ndestined to supply his place, and become a tallow-chandler.  But my\ndislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that\nif he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and\nget to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation.  He\ntherefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners,\nbricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might\nobserve my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other\non land.  It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen\nhandle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much\nby it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman\ncould not readily be got, and to construct little machines for my\nexperiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and\nwarm in my mind.  My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and\nmy uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in\nLondon, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be\nwith him some time on liking.  But his expectations of a fee with me\ndispleasing my father, I was taken home again.\n\nFrom a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came\ninto my hands was ever laid out in books.  Pleased with the Pilgrim's\nProgress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate\nlittle volumes.  I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's\nHistorical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40\nor 50 in all.  My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in\npolemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted\nthat, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper\nbooks had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not\nbe a clergyman.  Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly,\nand I still think that time spent to great advantage.  There was also a\nbook of De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr.\nMather's, called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of\nthinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events\nof my life.\n\nThis bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a\nprinter, though he had already one son (James) of that profession.  In\n1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to\nset up his business in Boston.  I liked it much better than that of my\nfather, but still had a hankering for the sea.  To prevent the\napprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to\nhave me bound to my brother.  I stood out some time, but at last was\npersuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years\nold.  I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of\nage, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year.\nIn a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a\nuseful hand to my brother.  I now had access to better books.  An\nacquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes\nto borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean.\nOften I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when\nthe book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the\nmorning, lest it should be missed or wanted.\n\nAnd after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had\na pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house,\ntook notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me\nsuch books as I chose to read.  I now took a fancy to poetry, and made\nsome little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turn to account,\nencouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads.  One was\ncalled The Lighthouse Tragedy, and contained an account of the drowning\nof Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters: the other was a sailor's\nsong, on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard) the pirate.  They were\nwretched stuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were\nprinted he sent me about the town to sell them.  The first sold\nwonderfully, the event being recent, having made a great noise.  This\nflattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my\nperformances, and telling me verse-makers were generally beggars.  So I\nescaped being a poet, most probably a very bad one; but as prose\nwriting had been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a\nprincipal means of my advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a\nsituation, I acquired what little ability I have in that way.\n\nThere was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with\nwhom I was intimately acquainted.  We sometimes disputed, and very fond\nwe were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another, which\ndisputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad habit,\nmaking people often extremely disagreeable in company by the\ncontradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence,\nbesides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of\ndisgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for\nfriendship.  I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute\nabout religion.  Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom\nfall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that\nhave been bred at Edinborough.\n\nA question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me,\nof the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their\nabilities for study.  He was of opinion that it was improper, and that\nthey were naturally unequal to it.  I took the contrary side, perhaps a\nlittle for dispute's sake.  He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready\nplenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his\nfluency than by the strength of his reasons.  As we parted without\nsettling the point, and were not to see one another again for some\ntime, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair\nand sent to him.  He answered, and I replied.  Three or four letters of\na side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read\nthem.  Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk\nto me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the\nadvantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I\now'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of\nexpression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by\nseveral instances.  I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew\nmore attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at\nimprovement.\n\nAbout this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator.  It was the\nthird.  I had never before seen any of them.  I bought it, read it over\nand over, and was much delighted with it.  I thought the writing\nexcellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it.  With this view I\ntook some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in\neach sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at\nthe book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted\nsentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in\nany suitable words that should come to hand.  Then I compared my\nSpectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and\ncorrected them.  But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness\nin recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired\nbefore that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual\noccasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit\nthe measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me\nunder a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have\ntended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it.\nTherefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and,\nafter a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them\nback again.  I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into\nconfusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best\norder, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the\npaper.  This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts.  By\ncomparing my work afterwards with the original, I discovered many\nfaults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying\nthat, in certain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough\nto improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think\nI might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of\nwhich I was extremely ambitious.  My time for these exercises and for\nreading was at night, after work or before it began in the morning, or\non Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading\nas much as I could the common attendance on public worship which my\nfather used to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeed\nI still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford\ntime to practise it.\n\nWhen about 16 years of age I happened to meet with a book, written by\none Tryon, recommending a vegetable diet.  I determined to go into it.\nMy brother, being yet unmarried, did not keep house, but boarded\nhimself and his apprentices in another family.  My refusing to eat\nflesh occasioned an inconveniency, and I was frequently chid for my\nsingularity.  I made myself acquainted with Tryon's manner of preparing\nsome of his dishes, such as boiling potatoes or rice, making hasty\npudding, and a few others, and then proposed to my brother, that if he\nwould give me, weekly, half the money he paid for my board, I would\nboard myself.  He instantly agreed to it, and I presently found that I\ncould save half what he paid me.  This was an additional fund for\nbuying books.  But I had another advantage in it.  My brother and the\nrest going from the printing-house to their meals, I remained there\nalone, and, despatching presently my light repast, which often was no\nmore than a bisket or a slice of bread, a handful of raisins or a tart\nfrom the pastry-cook's, and a glass of water, had the rest of the time\ntill their return for study, in which I made the greater progress, from\nthat greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension which usually\nattend temperance in eating and drinking.\n\nAnd now it was that, being on some occasion made asham'd of my\nignorance in figures, which I had twice failed in learning when at\nschool, I took Cocker's book of Arithmetick, and went through the whole\nby myself with great ease.  I also read Seller's and Shermy's books of\nNavigation, and became acquainted with the little geometry they\ncontain; but never proceeded far in that science.  And I read about\nthis time Locke On Human Understanding, and the Art of Thinking, by\nMessrs. du Port Royal.\n\nWhile I was intent on improving my language, I met with an English\ngrammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the end of which there were\ntwo little sketches of the arts of rhetoric and logic, the latter\nfinishing with a specimen of a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon\nafter I procur'd Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there\nare many instances of the same method.  I was charm'd with it, adopted\nit, dropt my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation, and put\non the humble inquirer and doubter.  And being then, from reading\nShaftesbury and Collins, become a real doubter in many points of our\nreligious doctrine, I found this method safest for myself and very\nembarrassing to those against whom I used it; therefore I took a\ndelight in it, practis'd it continually, and grew very artful and\nexpert in drawing people, even of superior knowledge, into concessions,\nthe consequences of which they did not foresee, entangling them in\ndifficulties out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so\nobtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always deserved.\nI continu'd this method some few years, but gradually left it,\nretaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest\ndiffidence; never using, when I advanced any thing that may possibly be\ndisputed, the words certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give the\nair of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or\napprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or I should think\nit so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it\nis so, if I am not mistaken.  This habit, I believe, has been of great\nadvantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and\npersuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engag'd\nin promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or\nto be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible\nmen would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming\nmanner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and\nto defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us,\nto wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.  For, if you would\ninform, a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments\nmay provoke contradiction and prevent a candid attention.  If you wish\ninformation and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet at\nthe same time express yourself as firmly fix'd in your present\nopinions, modest, sensible men, who do not love disputation, will\nprobably leave you undisturbed in the possession of your error.  And by\nsuch a manner, you can seldom hope to recommend yourself in pleasing\nyour hearers, or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire.  Pope\nsays, judiciously:\n\n          \"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,\n          And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;\"\n\nfarther recommending to us\n\n          \"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence.\"\n\nAnd he might have coupled with this line that which he has coupled with\nanother, I think, less properly,\n\n          \"For want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nIf you ask, Why less properly? I must repeat the lines,\n\n          \"Immodest words admit of no defense,\n          For want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nNow, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it)\nsome apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines stand\nmore justly thus?\n\n          \"Immodest words admit but this defense,\n          That want of modesty is want of sense.\"\n\nThis, however, I should submit to better judgments.\n\nMy brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper.  It was\nthe second that appeared in America, and was called the New England\nCourant.  The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember\nhis being dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not\nlikely to succeed, one newspaper being, in their judgment, enough for\nAmerica.  At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty.\nHe went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in\ncomposing the types and printing off the sheets, I was employed to\ncarry the papers thro' the streets to the customers.\n\nHe had some ingenious men among his friends, who amus'd themselves by\nwriting little pieces for this paper, which gain'd it credit and made\nit more in demand, and these gentlemen often visited us.  Hearing their\nconversations, and their accounts of the approbation their papers were\nreceived with, I was excited to try my hand among them; but, being\nstill a boy, and suspecting that my brother would object to printing\nanything of mine in his paper if he knew it to be mine, I contrived to\ndisguise my hand, and, writing an anonymous paper, I put it in at night\nunder the door of the printing-house. It was found in the morning, and\ncommunicated to his writing friends when they call'd in as usual.  They\nread it, commented on it in my hearing, and I had the exquisite\npleasure of finding it met with their approbation, and that, in their\ndifferent guesses at the author, none were named but men of some\ncharacter among us for learning and ingenuity.  I suppose now that I\nwas rather lucky in my judges, and that perhaps they were not really so\nvery good ones as I then esteem'd them.\n\nEncourag'd, however, by this, I wrote and convey'd in the same way to\nthe press several more papers which were equally approv'd; and I kept\nmy secret till my small fund of sense for such performances was pretty\nwell exhausted and then I discovered it, when I began to be considered\na little more by my brother's acquaintance, and in a manner that did\nnot quite please him, as he thought, probably with reason, that it\ntended to make me too vain.  And, perhaps, this might be one occasion\nof the differences that we began to have about this time.  Though a\nbrother, he considered himself as my master, and me as his apprentice,\nand accordingly, expected the same services from me as he would from\nanother, while I thought he demean'd me too much in some he requir'd of\nme, who from a brother expected more indulgence.  Our disputes were\noften brought before our father, and I fancy I was either generally in\nthe right, or else a better pleader, because the judgment was generally\nin my favor.  But my brother was passionate, and had often beaten me,\nwhich I took extreamly amiss; and, thinking my apprenticeship very\ntedious, I was continually wishing for some opportunity of shortening\nit, which at length offered in a manner unexpected.[3]\n\n      [3] I fancy his harsh and tyrannical treatment of me\n          might be a means of impressing me with that aversion\n          to arbitrary power that has stuck to me through my\n          whole life.\n\nOne of the pieces in our newspaper on some political point, which I\nhave now forgotten, gave offense to the Assembly.  He was taken up,\ncensur'd, and imprison'd for a month, by the speaker's warrant, I\nsuppose, because he would not discover his author.  I too was taken up\nand examin'd before the council; but, tho' I did not give them any\nsatisfaction, they content'd themselves with admonishing me, and\ndismissed me, considering me, perhaps, as an apprentice, who was bound\nto keep his master's secrets.\n\nDuring my brother's confinement, which I resented a good deal,\nnotwithstanding our private differences, I had the management of the\npaper; and I made bold to give our rulers some rubs in it, which my\nbrother took very kindly, while others began to consider me in an\nunfavorable light, as a young genius that had a turn for libelling and\nsatyr.  My brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the\nHouse (a very odd one), that \"James Franklin should no longer print the\npaper called the New England Courant.\"\n\nThere was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,\nwhat he should do in this case.  Some proposed to evade the order by\nchanging the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences\nin that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be\nprinted for the future under the name of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN; and to\navoid the censure of the Assembly, that might fall on him as still\nprinting it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old\nindenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back\nof it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my\nservice, I was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,\nwhich were to be kept private.  A very flimsy scheme it was; however,\nit was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under\nmy name for several months.\n\nAt length, a fresh difference arising between my brother and me, I took\nupon me to assert my freedom, presuming that he would not venture to\nproduce the new indentures.  It was not fair in me to take this\nadvantage, and this I therefore reckon one of the first errata of my\nlife; but the unfairness of it weighed little with me, when under the\nimpressions of resentment for the blows his passion too often urged him\nto bestow upon me, though he was otherwise not an ill-natur'd man:\nperhaps I was too saucy and provoking.\n\nWhen he found I would leave him, he took care to prevent my getting\nemployment in any other printing-house of the town, by going round and\nspeaking to every master, who accordingly refus'd to give me work.  I\nthen thought of going to New York, as the nearest place where there was\na printer; and I was rather inclin'd to leave Boston when I reflected\nthat I had already made myself a little obnoxious to the governing\nparty, and, from the arbitrary proceedings of the Assembly in my\nbrother's case, it was likely I might, if I stay'd, soon bring myself\ninto scrapes; and farther, that my indiscrete disputations about\nreligion began to make me pointed at with horror by good people as an\ninfidel or atheist.  I determin'd on the point, but my father now\nsiding with my brother, I was sensible that, if I attempted to go\nopenly, means would be used to prevent me.  My friend Collins,\ntherefore, undertook to manage a little for me.  He agreed with the\ncaptain of a New York sloop for my passage, under the notion of my\nbeing a young acquaintance of his, that had got a naughty girl with\nchild, whose friends would compel me to marry her, and therefore I\ncould not appear or come away publicly.  So I sold some of my books to\nraise a little money, was taken on board privately, and as we had a\nfair wind, in three days I found myself in New York, near 300 miles\nfrom home, a boy of but 17, without the least recommendation to, or\nknowledge of any person in the place, and with very little money in my\npocket.\n\nMy inclinations for the sea were by this time worne out, or I might now\nhave gratify'd them.  But, having a trade, and supposing myself a\npretty good workman, I offer'd my service to the printer in the place,\nold Mr. William Bradford, who had been the first printer in\nPennsylvania, but removed from thence upon the quarrel of George Keith.\nHe could give me no employment, having little to do, and help enough\nalready; but says he, \"My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his\nprincipal hand, Aquila Rose, by death; if you go thither, I believe he\nmay employ you.\"  Philadelphia was a hundred miles further; I set out,\nhowever, in a boat for Amboy, leaving my chest and things to follow me\nround by sea.\n\nIn crossing the bay, we met with a squall that tore our rotten sails to\npieces, prevented our getting into the Kill and drove us upon Long\nIsland.  In our way, a drunken Dutchman, who was a passenger too, fell\noverboard; when he was sinking, I reached through the water to his\nshock pate, and drew him up, so that we got him in again.  His ducking\nsobered him a little, and he went to sleep, taking first out of his\npocket a book, which he desir'd I would dry for him.  It proved to be\nmy old favorite author, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, in Dutch, finely\nprinted on good paper, with copper cuts, a dress better than I had ever\nseen it wear in its own language.  I have since found that it has been\ntranslated into most of the languages of Europe, and suppose it has\nbeen more generally read than any other book, except perhaps the Bible.\nHonest John was the first that I know of who mix'd narration and\ndialogue; a method of writing very engaging to the reader, who in the\nmost interesting parts finds himself, as it were, brought into the\ncompany and present at the discourse.  De Foe in his Cruso, his Moll\nFlanders, Religious Courtship, Family Instructor, and other pieces, has\nimitated it with success; and Richardson has done the same, in his\nPamela, etc.\n\nWhen we drew near the island, we found it was at a place where there\ncould be no landing, there being a great surff on the stony beach.  So\nwe dropt anchor, and swung round towards the shore.  Some people came\ndown to the water edge and hallow'd to us, as we did to them; but the\nwind was so high, and the surff so loud, that we could not hear so as\nto understand each other.  There were canoes on the shore, and we made\nsigns, and hallow'd that they should fetch us; but they either did not\nunderstand us, or thought it impracticable, so they went away, and\nnight coming on, we had no remedy but to wait till the wind should\nabate; and, in the meantime, the boatman and I concluded to sleep, if\nwe could; and so crowded into the scuttle, with the Dutchman, who was\nstill wet, and the spray beating over the head of our boat, leak'd\nthro' to us, so that we were soon almost as wet as he.  In this manner\nwe lay all night, with very little rest; but, the wind abating the next\nday, we made a shift to reach Amboy before night, having been thirty\nhours on the water, without victuals, or any drink but a bottle of\nfilthy rum, and the water we sail'd on being salt.\n\nIn the evening I found myself very feverish, and went in to bed; but,\nhaving read somewhere that cold water drank plentifully was good for a\nfever, I follow'd the prescription, sweat plentiful most of the night,\nmy fever left me, and in the morning, crossing the ferry, I proceeded\non my journey on foot, having fifty miles to Burlington, where I was\ntold I should find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to\nPhiladelphia.\n\nIt rained very hard all the day; I was thoroughly soak'd, and by noon a\ngood deal tired; so I stopt at a poor inn, where I staid all night,\nbeginning now to wish that I had never left home.  I cut so miserable a\nfigure, too, that I found, by the questions ask'd me, I was suspected\nto be some runaway servant, and in danger of being taken up on that\nsuspicion.  However, I proceeded the next day, and got in the evening\nto an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr.\nBrown.  He entered into conversation with me while I took some\nrefreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and\nfriendly.  Our acquaintance continu'd as long as he liv'd. He had been,\nI imagine, an itinerant doctor, for there was no town in England, or\ncountry in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular\naccount.  He had some letters, and was ingenious, but much of an\nunbeliever, and wickedly undertook, some years after, to travestie the\nBible in doggrel verse, as Cotton had done Virgil.  By this means he\nset many of the facts in a very ridiculous light, and might have hurt\nweak minds if his work had been published; but it never was.\n\nAt his house I lay that night, and the next morning reach'd Burlington,\nbut had the mortification to find that the regular boats were gone a\nlittle before my coming, and no other expected to go before Tuesday,\nthis being Saturday; wherefore I returned to an old woman in the town,\nof whom I had bought gingerbread to eat on the water, and ask'd her\nadvice.  She invited me to lodge at her house till a passage by water\nshould offer; and being tired with my foot travelling, I accepted the\ninvitation.  She understanding I was a printer, would have had me stay\nat that town and follow my business, being ignorant of the stock\nnecessary to begin with.  She was very hospitable, gave me a dinner of\nox-cheek with great good will, accepting only a pot of ale in return;\nand I thought myself fixed till Tuesday should come.  However, walking\nin the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I found\nwas going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her.  They took\nme in, and, as there was no wind, we row'd all the way; and about\nmidnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were\nconfident we must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others\nknew not where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek,\nlanded near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the\nnight being cold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.\nThen one of the company knew the place to be Cooper's Creek, a little\nabove Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek,\nand arriv'd there about eight or nine o'clock on the Sunday morning,\nand landed at the Market-street wharf.\n\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your mind\ncompare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made\nthere.  I was in my working dress, my best cloaths being to come round\nby sea.  I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuff'd out with\nshirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging.\nI was fatigued with travelling, rowing, and want of rest, I was very\nhungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and\nabout a shilling in copper.  The latter I gave the people of the boat\nfor my passage, who at first refus'd it, on account of my rowing; but I\ninsisted on their taking it.  A man being sometimes more generous when\nhe has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps thro' fear\nof being thought to have but little.\n\nThen I walked up the street, gazing about till near the market-house I\nmet a boy with bread.  I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker's he directed me to,\nin Secondstreet, and ask'd for bisket, intending such as we had in\nBoston; but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia.  Then I\nasked for a three-penny loaf, and was told they had none such.  So not\nconsidering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater\ncheapness nor the names of his bread, I made him give me three-penny\nworth of any sort.  He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls.\nI was surpriz'd at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my\npockets, walk'd off with a roll under each arm, and eating the other.\nThus I went up Market-street as far as Fourth-street, passing by the\ndoor of Mr. Read, my future wife's father; when she, standing at the\ndoor, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,\nridiculous appearance.  Then I turned and went down Chestnut-street and\npart of Walnut-street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,\nfound myself again at Market-street wharf, near the boat I came in, to\nwhich I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with\none of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came\ndown the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\n\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had\nmany clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way.  I\njoined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the\nQuakers near the market.  I sat down among them, and, after looking\nround awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labor\nand want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued\nso till the meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me.\nThis was, therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in\nPhiladelphia.\n\nWalking down again toward the river, and, looking in the faces of\npeople, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I lik'd, and,\naccosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get\nlodging.  We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners.  \"Here,\"\nsays he, \"is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a\nreputable house; if thee wilt walk with me, I'll show thee a better.\"\nHe brought me to the Crooked Billet in Water-street. Here I got a\ndinner; and, while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked\nme, as it seemed to be suspected from my youth and appearance, that I\nmight be some runaway.\n\nAfter dinner, my sleepiness return'd, and being shown to a bed, I lay\ndown without undressing, and slept till six in the evening, was call'd\nto supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till next\nmorning.  Then I made myself as tidy as I could, and went to Andrew\nBradford the printer's. I found in the shop the old man his father,\nwhom I had seen at New York, and who, travelling on horseback, had got\nto Philadelphia before me.  He introduc'd me to his son, who receiv'd\nme civilly, gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at present want\na hand, being lately suppli'd with one; but there was another printer\nin town, lately set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ me; if\nnot, I should be welcome to lodge at his house, and he would give me a\nlittle work to do now and then till fuller business should offer.\n\nThe old gentleman said he would go with me to the new printer; and when\nwe found him, \"Neighbor,\" says Bradford, \"I have brought to see you a\nyoung man of your business; perhaps you may want such a one.\"  He ask'd\nme a few questions, put a composing stick in my hand to see how I\nwork'd, and then said he would employ me soon, though he had just then\nnothing for me to do; and, taking old Bradford, whom he had never seen\nbefore, to be one of the town's people that had a good will for him,\nenter'd into a conversation on his present undertaking and projects;\nwhile Bradford, not discovering that he was the other printer's father,\non Keimer's saying he expected soon to get the greatest part of the\nbusiness into his own hands, drew him on by artful questions, and\nstarting little doubts, to explain all his views, what interests he\nreli'd on, and in what manner he intended to proceed.  I, who stood by\nand heard all, saw immediately that one of them was a crafty old\nsophister, and the other a mere novice.  Bradford left me with Keimer,\nwho was greatly surpris'd when I told him who the old man was.\n\nKeimer's printing-house, I found, consisted of an old shatter'd press,\nand one small, worn-out font of English which he was then using\nhimself, composing an Elegy on Aquila Rose, before mentioned, an\ningenious young man, of excellent character, much respected in the\ntown, clerk of the Assembly, and a pretty poet.  Keimer made verses\ntoo, but very indifferently.  He could not be said to write them, for\nhis manner was to compose them in the types directly out of his head.\nSo there being no copy, but one pair of cases, and the Elegy likely to\nrequire all the letter, no one could help him.  I endeavor'd to put his\npress (which he had not yet us'd, and of which he understood nothing)\ninto order fit to be work'd with; and, promising to come and print off\nhis Elegy as soon as he should have got it ready, I return'd to\nBradford's, who gave me a little job to do for the present, and there I\nlodged and dieted. A few days after, Keimer sent for me to print off\nthe Elegy.  And now he had got another pair of cases, and a pamphlet to\nreprint, on which he set me to work.\n\nThese two printers I found poorly qualified for their business.\nBradford had not been bred to it, and was very illiterate; and Keimer,\ntho' something of a scholar, was a mere compositor, knowing nothing of\npresswork.  He had been one of the French prophets, and could act their\nenthusiastic agitations.  At this time he did not profess any\nparticular religion, but something of all on occasion; was very\nignorant of the world, and had, as I afterward found, a good deal of\nthe knave in his composition.  He did not like my lodging at Bradford's\nwhile I work'd with him.  He had a house, indeed, but without\nfurniture, so he could not lodge me; but he got me a lodging at Mr.\nRead's, before mentioned, who was the owner of his house; and, my chest\nand clothes being come by this time, I made rather a more respectable\nappearance in the eyes of Miss Read than I had done when she first\nhappen'd to see me eating my roll in the street.\n\nI began now to have some acquaintance among the young people of the\ntown, that were lovers of reading, with whom I spent my evenings very\npleasantly; and gaining money by my industry and frugality, I lived\nvery agreeably, forgetting Boston as much as I could, and not desiring\nthat any there should know where I resided, except my friend Collins,\nwho was in my secret, and kept it when I wrote to him.  At length, an\nincident happened that sent me back again much sooner than I had\nintended.  I had a brother-in-law, Robert Holmes, master of a sloop\nthat traded between Boston and Delaware.  He being at Newcastle, forty\nmiles below Philadelphia, heard there of me, and wrote me a letter\nmentioning the concern of my friends in Boston at my abrupt departure,\nassuring me of their good will to me, and that every thing would be\naccommodated to my mind if I would return, to which he exhorted me very\nearnestly.  I wrote an answer to his letter, thank'd him for his\nadvice, but stated my reasons for quitting Boston fully and in such a\nlight as to convince him I was not so wrong as he had apprehended.\n\nSir William Keith, governor of the province, was then at Newcastle, and\nCaptain Holmes, happening to be in company with him when my letter came\nto hand, spoke to him of me, and show'd him the letter.  The governor\nread it, and seem'd surpris'd when he was told my age.  He said I\nappear'd a young man of promising parts, and therefore should be\nencouraged; the printers at Philadelphia were wretched ones; and, if I\nwould set up there, he made no doubt I should succeed; for his part, he\nwould procure me the public business, and do me every other service in\nhis power.  This my brother-in-law afterwards told me in Boston, but I\nknew as yet nothing of it; when, one day, Keimer and I being at work\ntogether near the window, we saw the governor and another gentleman\n(which proved to be Colonel French, of Newcastle), finely dress'd, come\ndirectly across the street to our house, and heard them at the door.\n\nKeimer ran down immediately, thinking it a visit to him; but the\ngovernor inquir'd for me, came up, and with a condescension of\npoliteness I had been quite unus'd to, made me many compliments,\ndesired to be acquainted with me, blam'd me kindly for not having made\nmyself known to him when I first came to the place, and would have me\naway with him to the tavern, where he was going with Colonel French to\ntaste, as he said, some excellent Madeira.  I was not a little\nsurprised, and Keimer star'd like a pig poison'd.  I went, however,\nwith the governor and Colonel French to a tavern, at the corner of\nThird-street, and over the Madeira he propos'd my setting up my\nbusiness, laid before me the probabilities of success, and both he and\nColonel French assur'd me I should have their interest and influence in\nprocuring the public business of both governments.  On my doubting\nwhether my father would assist me in it, Sir William said he would give\nme a letter to him, in which he would state the advantages, and he did\nnot doubt of prevailing with him.  So it was concluded I should return\nto Boston in the first vessel, with the governor's letter recommending\nme to my father.  In the mean time the intention was to be kept a\nsecret, and I went on working with Keimer as usual, the governor\nsending for me now and then to dine with him, a very great honor I\nthought it, and conversing with me in the most affable, familiar, and\nfriendly manner imaginable.\n\nAbout the end of April, 1724, a little vessel offer'd for Boston.  I\ntook leave of Keimer as going to see my friends.  The governor gave me\nan ample letter, saying many flattering things of me to my father, and\nstrongly recommending the project of my setting up at Philadelphia as a\nthing that must make my fortune.  We struck on a shoal in going down\nthe bay, and sprung a leak; we had a blustering time at sea, and were\noblig'd to pump almost continually, at which I took my turn.  We\narriv'd safe, however, at Boston in about a fortnight.  I had been\nabsent seven months, and my friends had heard nothing of me; for my br.\nHolmes was not yet return'd, and had not written about me.  My\nunexpected appearance surpriz'd the family; all were, however, very\nglad to see me, and made me welcome, except my brother.  I went to see\nhim at his printing-house. I was better dress'd than ever while in his\nservice, having a genteel new suit from head to foot, a watch, and my\npockets lin'd with near five pounds sterling in silver.  He receiv'd me\nnot very frankly, look'd me all over, and turn'd to his work again.\n\nThe journeymen were inquisitive where I had been, what sort of a\ncountry it was, and how I lik'd it.  I prais'd it much, the happy life\nI led in it, expressing strongly my intention of returning to it; and,\none of them asking what kind of money we had there, I produc'd a\nhandful of silver, and spread it before them, which was a kind of\nraree-show they had not been us'd to, paper being the money of Boston.\nThen I took an opportunity of letting them see my watch; and, lastly\n(my brother still grum and sullen), I gave them a piece of eight to\ndrink, and took my leave.  This visit of mine offended him extreamly;\nfor, when my mother some time after spoke to him of a reconciliation,\nand of her wishes to see us on good terms together, and that we might\nlive for the future as brothers, he said I had insulted him in such a\nmanner before his people that he could never forget or forgive it.  In\nthis, however, he was mistaken.\n\nMy father received the governor's letter with some apparent surprise,\nbut said little of it to me for some days, when Capt. Holmes returning\nhe showed it to him, ask'd him if he knew Keith, and what kind of man\nhe was; adding his opinion that he must be of small discretion to think\nof setting a boy up in business who wanted yet three years of being at\nman's estate.  Holmes said what he could in favor of the project, but\nmy father was clear in the impropriety of it, and at last gave a flat\ndenial to it.  Then he wrote a civil letter to Sir William, thanking\nhim for the patronage he had so kindly offered me, but declining to\nassist me as yet in setting up, I being, in his opinion, too young to\nbe trusted with the management of a business so important, and for\nwhich the preparation must be so expensive.\n\nMy friend and companion Collins, who was a clerk in the post-office,\npleas'd with the account I gave him of my new country, determined to go\nthither also; and, while I waited for my father's determination, he set\nout before me by land to Rhode Island, leaving his books, which were a\npretty collection of mathematicks and natural philosophy, to come with\nmine and me to New York, where he propos'd to wait for me.\n\nMy father, tho' he did not approve Sir William's proposition, was yet\npleas'd that I had been able to obtain so advantageous a character from\na person of such note where I had resided, and that I had been so\nindustrious and careful as to equip myself so handsomely in so short a\ntime; therefore, seeing no prospect of an accommodation between my\nbrother and me, he gave his consent to my returning again to\nPhiladelphia, advis'd me to behave respectfully to the people there,\nendeavor to obtain the general esteem, and avoid lampooning and\nlibeling, to which he thought I had too much inclination; telling me,\nthat by steady industry and a prudent parsimony I might save enough by\nthe time I was one-and-twenty to set me up; and that, if I came near\nthe matter, he would help me out with the rest.  This was all I could\nobtain, except some small gifts as tokens of his and my mother's love,\nwhen I embark'd again for New York, now with their approbation and\ntheir blessing.\n\nThe sloop putting in at Newport, Rhode Island, I visited my brother\nJohn, who had been married and settled there some years.  He received\nme very affectionately, for he always lov'd me.  A friend of his, one\nVernon, having some money due to him in Pensilvania, about thirty-five\npounds currency, desired I would receive it for him, and keep it till I\nhad his directions what to remit it in.  Accordingly, he gave me an\norder.  This afterwards occasion'd me a good deal of uneasiness.\n\nAt Newport we took in a number of passengers for New York, among which\nwere two young women, companions, and a grave, sensible, matron-like\nQuaker woman, with her attendants.  I had shown an obliging readiness\nto do her some little services, which impress'd her I suppose with a\ndegree of good will toward me; therefore, when she saw a daily growing\nfamiliarity between me and the two young women, which they appear'd to\nencourage, she took me aside, and said: \"Young man, I am concern'd for\nthee, as thou has no friend with thee, and seems not to know much of\nthe world, or of the snares youth is expos'd to; depend upon it, those\nare very bad women; I can see it in all their actions; and if thee art\nnot upon thy guard, they will draw thee into some danger; they are\nstrangers to thee, and I advise thee, in a friendly concern for thy\nwelfare, to have no acquaintance with them.\"  As I seem'd at first not\nto think so ill of them as she did, she mentioned some things she had\nobserv'd and heard that had escap'd my notice, but now convinc'd me she\nwas right.  I thank'd her for her kind advice, and promis'd to follow\nit.  When we arriv'd at New York, they told me where they liv'd, and\ninvited me to come and see them; but I avoided it, and it was well I\ndid; for the next day the captain miss'd a silver spoon and some other\nthings, that had been taken out of his cabbin, and, knowing that these\nwere a couple of strumpets, he got a warrant to search their lodgings,\nfound the stolen goods, and had the thieves punish'd. So, tho' we had\nescap'd a sunken rock, which we scrap'd upon in the passage, I thought\nthis escape of rather more importance to me.\n\nAt New York I found my friend Collins, who had arriv'd there some time\nbefore me.  We had been intimate from children, and had read the same\nbooks together; but he had the advantage of more time for reading and\nstudying, and a wonderful genius for mathematical learning, in which he\nfar outstript me.  While I liv'd in Boston most of my hours of leisure\nfor conversation were spent with him, and he continu'd a sober as well\nas an industrious lad; was much respected for his learning by several\nof the clergy and other gentlemen, and seemed to promise making a good\nfigure in life.  But, during my absence, he had acquir'd a habit of\nsotting with brandy; and I found by his own account, and what I heard\nfrom others, that he had been drunk every day since his arrival at New\nYork, and behav'd very oddly.  He had gam'd, too, and lost his money,\nso that I was oblig'd to discharge his lodgings, and defray his\nexpenses to and at Philadelphia, which prov'd extremely inconvenient to\nme.\n\nThe then governor of New York, Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet), hearing\nfrom the captain that a young man, one of his passengers, had a great\nmany books, desir'd he would bring me to see him.  I waited upon him\naccordingly, and should have taken Collins with me but that he was not\nsober.  The gov'r. treated me with great civility, show'd me his\nlibrary, which was a very large one, and we had a good deal of\nconversation about books and authors.  This was the second governor who\nhad done me the honor to take notice of me; which, to a poor boy like\nme, was very pleasing.\n\nWe proceeded to Philadelphia.  I received on the way Vernon's money,\nwithout which we could hardly have finish'd our journey.  Collins\nwished to be employ'd in some counting-house, but, whether they\ndiscover'd his dramming by his breath, or by his behaviour, tho' he had\nsome recommendations, he met with no success in any application, and\ncontinu'd lodging and boarding at the same house with me, and at my\nexpense.  Knowing I had that money of Vernon's, he was continually\nborrowing of me, still promising repayment as soon as he should be in\nbusiness.  At length he had got so much of it that I was distress'd to\nthink what I should do in case of being call'd on to remit it.\n\nHis drinking continu'd, about which we sometimes quarrell'd; for, when\na little intoxicated, he was very fractious.  Once, in a boat on the\nDelaware with some other young men, he refused to row in his turn.  \"I\nwill be row'd home,\" says he.  \"We will not row you,\" says I. \"You\nmust, or stay all night on the water,\" says he, \"just as you please.\"\nThe others said, \"Let us row; what signifies it?\"  But, my mind being\nsoured with his other conduct, I continu'd to refuse.  So he swore he\nwould make me row, or throw me overboard; and coming along, stepping on\nthe thwarts, toward me, when he came up and struck at me, I clapped my\nhand under his crutch, and, rising, pitched him head-foremost into the\nriver.  I knew he was a good swimmer, and so was under little concern\nabout him; but before he could get round to lay hold of the boat, we\nhad with a few strokes pull'd her out of his reach; and ever when he\ndrew near the boat, we ask'd if he would row, striking a few strokes to\nslide her away from him.  He was ready to die with vexation, and\nobstinately would not promise to row.  However, seeing him at last\nbeginning to tire, we lifted him in and brought him home dripping wet\nin the evening.  We hardly exchang'd a civil word afterwards, and a\nWest India captain, who had a commission to procure a tutor for the\nsons of a gentleman at Barbadoes, happening to meet with him, agreed to\ncarry him thither.  He left me then, promising to remit me the first\nmoney he should receive in order to discharge the debt; but I never\nheard of him after.\n\nThe breaking into this money of Vernon's was one of the first great\nerrata of my life; and this affair show'd that my father was not much\nout in his judgment when he suppos'd me too young to manage business of\nimportance.  But Sir William, on reading his letter, said he was too\nprudent.  There was great difference in persons; and discretion did not\nalways accompany years, nor was youth always without it.  \"And since he\nwill not set you up,\" says he, \"I will do it myself.  Give me an\ninventory of the things necessary to be had from England, and I will\nsend for them.  You shall repay me when you are able; I am resolv'd to\nhave a good printer here, and I am sure you must succeed.\"  This was\nspoken with such an appearance of cordiality, that I had not the least\ndoubt of his meaning what he said.  I had hitherto kept the proposition\nof my setting up, a secret in Philadelphia, and I still kept it.  Had\nit been known that I depended on the governor, probably some friend,\nthat knew him better, would have advis'd me not to rely on him, as I\nafterwards heard it as his known character to be liberal of promises\nwhich he never meant to keep.  Yet, unsolicited as he was by me, how\ncould I think his generous offers insincere?  I believ'd him one of the\nbest men in the world.\n\nI presented him an inventory of a little print'g-house, amounting by my\ncomputation to about one hundred pounds sterling.  He lik'd it, but\nask'd me if my being on the spot in England to chuse the types, and see\nthat every thing was good of the kind, might not be of some advantage.\n\"Then,\" says he, \"when there, you may make acquaintances, and establish\ncorrespondences in the bookselling and stationery way.\" I agreed that\nthis might be advantageous.  \"Then,\" says he, \"get yourself ready to go\nwith Annis;\" which was the annual ship, and the only one at that time\nusually passing between London and Philadelphia.  But it would be some\nmonths before Annis sail'd, so I continu'd working with Keimer,\nfretting about the money Collins had got from me, and in daily\napprehensions of being call'd upon by Vernon, which, however, did not\nhappen for some years after.\n\nI believe I have omitted mentioning that, in my first voyage from\nBoston, being becalm'd off Block Island, our people set about catching\ncod, and hauled up a great many.  Hitherto I had stuck to my resolution\nof not eating animal food, and on this occasion consider'd, with my\nmaster Tryon, the taking every fish as a kind of unprovoked murder,\nsince none of them had, or ever could do us any injury that might\njustify the slaughter.  All this seemed very reasonable.  But I had\nformerly been a great lover of fish, and, when this came hot out of the\nfrying-pan, it smelt admirably well.  I balanc'd some time between\nprinciple and inclination, till I recollected that, when the fish were\nopened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then thought I,\n\"If you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.\"  So I\ndin'd upon cod very heartily, and continued to eat with other people,\nreturning only now and then occasionally to a vegetable diet.  So\nconvenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables\none to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.\n\nKeimer and I liv'd on a pretty good familiar footing, and agreed\ntolerably well, for he suspected nothing of my setting up.  He retained\na great deal of his old enthusiasms and lov'd argumentation.  We\ntherefore had many disputations.  I used to work him so with my\nSocratic method, and had trepann'd him so often by questions apparently\nso distant from any point we had in hand, and yet by degrees lead to\nthe point, and brought him into difficulties and contradictions, that\nat last he grew ridiculously cautious, and would hardly answer me the\nmost common question, without asking first, \"What do you intend to\ninfer from that?\"  However, it gave him so high an opinion of my\nabilities in the confuting way, that he seriously proposed my being his\ncolleague in a project he had of setting up a new sect.  He was to\npreach the doctrines, and I was to confound all opponents.  When he\ncame to explain with me upon the doctrines, I found several conundrums\nwhich I objected to, unless I might have my way a little too, and\nintroduce some of mine.\n\nKeimer wore his beard at full length, because somewhere in the Mosaic\nlaw it is said, \"Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard.\" He\nlikewise kept the Seventh day, Sabbath; and these two points were\nessentials with him.  I dislik'd both; but agreed to admit them upon\ncondition of his adopting the doctrine of using no animal food.  \"I\ndoubt,\" said he, \"my constitution will not bear that.\"  I assur'd him\nit would, and that he would be the better for it.  He was usually a\ngreat glutton, and I promised myself some diversion in half starving\nhim.  He agreed to try the practice, if I would keep him company.  I\ndid so, and we held it for three months.  We had our victuals dress'd,\nand brought to us regularly by a woman in the neighborhood, who had\nfrom me a list of forty dishes to be prepar'd for us at different\ntimes, in all which there was neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, and the\nwhim suited me the better at this time from the cheapness of it, not\ncosting us above eighteenpence sterling each per week.  I have since\nkept several Lents most strictly, leaving the common diet for that, and\nthat for the common, abruptly, without the least inconvenience, so that\nI think there is little in the advice of making those changes by easy\ngradations.  I went on pleasantly, but poor Keimer suffered grievously,\ntired of the project, long'd for the flesh-pots of Egypt, and order'd a\nroast pig.  He invited me and two women friends to dine with him; but,\nit being brought too soon upon table, he could not resist the\ntemptation, and ate the whole before we came.\n\nI had made some courtship during this time to Miss Read.  I had a great\nrespect and affection for her, and had some reason to believe she had\nthe same for me; but, as I was about to take a long voyage, and we were\nboth very young, only a little above eighteen, it was thought most\nprudent by her mother to prevent our going too far at present, as a\nmarriage, if it was to take place, would be more convenient after my\nreturn, when I should be, as I expected, set up in my business.\nPerhaps, too, she thought my expectations not so well founded as I\nimagined them to be.\n\nMy chief acquaintances at this time were Charles Osborne, Joseph\nWatson, and James Ralph, all lovers of reading.  The two first were\nclerks to an eminent scrivener or conveyancer in the town, Charles\nBrogden; the other was clerk to a merchant.  Watson was a pious,\nsensible young man, of great integrity; the others rather more lax in\ntheir principles of religion, particularly Ralph, who, as well as\nCollins, had been unsettled by me, for which they both made me suffer.\nOsborne was sensible, candid, frank; sincere and affectionate to his\nfriends; but, in literary matters, too fond of criticising.  Ralph was\ningenious, genteel in his manners, and extremely eloquent; I think I\nnever knew a prettier talker.  Both of them great admirers of poetry,\nand began to try their hands in little pieces.  Many pleasant walks we\nfour had together on Sundays into the woods, near Schuylkill, where we\nread to one another, and conferr'd on what we read.\n\nRalph was inclin'd to pursue the study of poetry, not doubting but he\nmight become eminent in it, and make his fortune by it, alleging that\nthe best poets must, when they first began to write, make as many\nfaults as he did.  Osborne dissuaded him, assur'd him he had no genius\nfor poetry, and advis'd him to think of nothing beyond the business he\nwas bred to; that, in the mercantile way, tho' he had no stock, he\nmight, by his diligence and punctuality, recommend himself to\nemployment as a factor, and in time acquire wherewith to trade on his\nown account.  I approv'd the amusing one's self with poetry now and\nthen, so far as to improve one's language, but no farther.\n\nOn this it was propos'd that we should each of us, at our next meeting,\nproduce a piece of our own composing, in order to improve by our mutual\nobservations, criticisms, and corrections.  As language and expression\nwere what we had in view, we excluded all considerations of invention\nby agreeing that the task should be a version of the eighteenth Psalm,\nwhich describes the descent of a Deity.  When the time of our meeting\ndrew nigh, Ralph called on me first, and let me know his piece was\nready.  I told him I had been busy, and, having little inclination, had\ndone nothing.  He then show'd me his piece for my opinion, and I much\napprov'd it, as it appear'd to me to have great merit.  \"Now,\" says he,\n\"Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine, but\nmakes 1000 criticisms out of mere envy.  He is not so jealous of you; I\nwish, therefore, you would take this piece, and produce it as yours; I\nwill pretend not to have had time, and so produce nothing.  We shall\nthen see what he will say to it.\" It was agreed, and I immediately\ntranscrib'd it, that it might appear in my own hand.\n\nWe met; Watson's performance was read; there were some beauties in it,\nbut many defects.  Osborne's was read; it was much better; Ralph did it\njustice; remarked some faults, but applauded the beauties.  He himself\nhad nothing to produce.  I was backward; seemed desirous of being\nexcused; had not had sufficient time to correct, etc.; but no excuse\ncould be admitted; produce I must.  It was read and repeated; Watson\nand Osborne gave up the contest, and join'd in applauding it.  Ralph\nonly made some criticisms, and propos'd some amendments; but I defended\nmy text.  Osborne was against Ralph, and told him he was no better a\ncritic than poet, so he dropt the argument.  As they two went home\ntogether, Osborne expressed himself still more strongly in favor of\nwhat he thought my production; having restrain'd himself before, as he\nsaid, lest I should think it flattery.  \"But who would have imagin'd,\"\nsaid he, \"that Franklin had been capable of such a performance; such\npainting, such force, such fire!  He has even improv'd the original.\nIn his common conversation he seems to have no choice of words; he\nhesitates and blunders; and yet, good God! how he writes!\" When we next\nmet, Ralph discovered the trick we had plaid him, and Osborne was a\nlittle laught at.\n\nThis transaction fixed Ralph in his resolution of becoming a poet.  I\ndid all I could to dissuade him from it, but he continued scribbling\nverses till Pope cured him.  He became, however, a pretty good prose\nwriter.  More of him hereafter.  But, as I may not have occasion again\nto mention the other two, I shall just remark here, that Watson died in\nmy arms a few years after, much lamented, being the best of our set.\nOsborne went to the West Indies, where he became an eminent lawyer and\nmade money, but died young.  He and I had made a serious agreement,\nthat the one who happen'd first to die should, if possible, make a\nfriendly visit to the other, and acquaint him how he found things in\nthat separate state.  But he never fulfill'd his promise.\n\nThe governor, seeming to like my company, had me frequently to his\nhouse, and his setting me up was always mention'd as a fixed thing.  I\nwas to take with me letters recommendatory to a number of his friends,\nbesides the letter of credit to furnish me with the necessary money for\npurchasing the press and types, paper, etc.  For these letters I was\nappointed to call at different times, when they were to be ready, but a\nfuture time was still named.  Thus he went on till the ship, whose\ndeparture too had been several times postponed, was on the point of\nsailing.  Then, when I call'd to take my leave and receive the letters,\nhis secretary, Dr. Bard, came out to me and said the governor was\nextremely busy in writing, but would be down at Newcastle before the\nship, and there the letters would be delivered to me.\n\nRalph, though married, and having one child, had determined to\naccompany me in this voyage.  It was thought he intended to establish a\ncorrespondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found\nafterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he\npurposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again.  Having\ntaken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss\nRead, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.\nThe governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary\ncame to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he\ncould not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost\nimportance, but should send the letters to me on board, wish'd me\nheartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc.  I returned on board a\nlittle puzzled, but still not doubting.\n\nMr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken passage\nin the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a Quaker\nmerchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work in\nMaryland, had engag'd the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were forced\nto take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board knowing us,\nwere considered as ordinary persons.  But Mr. Hamilton and his son (it\nwas James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to Philadelphia, the\nfather being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a seized ship; and,\njust before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on board, and showing me\ngreat respect, I was more taken notice of, and, with my friend Ralph,\ninvited by the other gentlemen to come into the cabin, there being now\nroom.  Accordingly, we remov'd thither.\n\nUnderstanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's\ndespatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be under\nmy care.  He said all were put into the bag together and he could not\nthen come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have an\nopportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the present,\nand we proceeded on our voyage.  We had a sociable company in the\ncabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.\nHamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully.  In this passage Mr.\nDenham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.\nThe voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of\nbad weather.\n\nWhen we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and\ngave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's letters.\nI found none upon which my name was put as under my care.  I picked out\nsix or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be the promised\nletters, especially as one of them was directed to Basket, the king's\nprinter, and another to some stationer.  We arriv'd in London the 24th\nof December, 1724.  I waited upon the stationer, who came first in my\nway, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith.  \"I don't know such\na person,\" says he; but, opening the letter, \"O! this is from\nRiddlesden.  I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal, and I\nwill have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from him.\"\nSo, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and left me\nto serve some customer.  I was surprized to find these were not the\ngovernor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing\ncircumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity.  I found my friend\nDenham, and opened the whole affair to him.  He let me into Keith's\ncharacter; told me there was not the least probability that he had\nwritten any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the smallest\ndependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the governor's giving\nme a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit to give.  On my\nexpressing some concern about what I should do, he advised me to\nendeavor getting some employment in the way of my business.  \"Among the\nprinters here,\" said he, \"you will improve yourself, and when you\nreturn to America, you will set up to greater advantage.\"\n\nWe both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, that\nRiddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave.  He had half ruin'd Miss\nRead's father by persuading him to be bound for him.  By this letter it\nappear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of Hamilton\n(suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was concerned\nin it with Riddlesden.  Denham, who was a friend of Hamilton's thought\nhe ought to be acquainted with it; so, when he arriv'd in England,\nwhich was soon after, partly from resentment and ill-will to Keith and\nRiddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I waited on him, and gave\nhim the letter.  He thank'd me cordially, the information being of\nimportance to him; and from that time he became my friend, greatly to\nmy advantage afterwards on many occasions.\n\nBut what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,\nand imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy!  It was a habit he had\nacquired.  He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give,\nhe gave expectations.  He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a\npretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not for\nhis constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes\ndisregarded.  Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed\nduring his administration.\n\nRalph and I were inseparable companions.  We took lodgings together in\nLittle Britain at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as we\ncould then afford.  He found some relations, but they were poor, and\nunable to assist him.  He now let me know his intentions of remaining\nin London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia.  He had\nbrought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been\nexpended in paying his passage.  I had fifteen pistoles; so he borrowed\noccasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for business.\nHe first endeavored to get into the playhouse, believing himself\nqualify'd for an actor; but Wilkes, to whom he apply'd, advis'd him\ncandidly not to think of that employment, as it was impossible he\nshould succeed in it.  Then he propos'd to Roberts, a publisher in\nPaternoster Row, to write for him a weekly paper like the Spectator, on\ncertain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.  Then he endeavored\nto get employment as a hackney writer, to copy for the stationers and\nlawyers about the Temple, but could find no vacancy.\n\nI immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-house\nin Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year.  I was pretty\ndiligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to\nplays and other places of amusement.  We had together consumed all my\npistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth.  He seem'd quite\nto forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with\nMiss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to\nlet her know I was not likely soon to return.  This was another of the\ngreat errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to\nlive it over again.  In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept\nunable to pay my passage.\n\nAt Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition of\nWollaston's \"Religion of Nature.\"  Some of his reasonings not appearing\nto me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I made\nremarks on them.  It was entitled \"A Dissertation on Liberty and\nNecessity, Pleasure and Pain.\" I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I\nprinted a small number.  It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr.\nPalmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously expostulated\nwith me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him appear'd\nabominable.  My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.  While I\nlodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one Wilcox, a\nbookseller, whose shop was at the next door.  He had an immense\ncollection of second-hand books.  Circulating libraries were not then\nin use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms, which I have\nnow forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his books.  This I\nesteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it as I could.\n\nMy pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a\nsurgeon, author of a book entitled \"The Infallibility of Human\nJudgment,\" it occasioned an acquaintance between us.  He took great\nnotice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects, carried\nme to the Horns, a pale alehouse in ---- Lane, Cheapside, and\nintroduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the \"Fable of the Bees,\" who\nhad a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most facetious,\nentertaining companion.  Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr. Pemberton, at\nBatson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an opportunity, some\ntime or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I was extreamely\ndesirous; but this never happened.\n\nI had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a\npurse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire.  Sir Hans Sloane\nheard of it, came to see me, and invited me to his house in Bloomsbury\nSquare, where he show'd me all his curiosities, and persuaded me to let\nhim add that to the number, for which he paid me handsomely.\n\nIn our house there lodg'd a young woman, a milliner, who, I think, had\na shop in the Cloisters.  She had been genteelly bred, was sensible and\nlively, and of most pleasing conversation.  Ralph read plays to her in\nthe evenings, they grew intimate, she took another lodging, and he\nfollowed her.  They liv'd together some time; but, he being still out\nof business, and her income not sufficient to maintain them with her\nchild, he took a resolution of going from London, to try for a country\nschool, which he thought himself well qualified to undertake, as he\nwrote an excellent hand, and was a master of arithmetic and accounts.\nThis, however, he deemed a business below him, and confident of future\nbetter fortune, when he should be unwilling to have it known that he\nonce was so meanly employed, he changed his name, and did me the honor\nto assume mine; for I soon after had a letter from him, acquainting me\nthat he was settled in a small village (in Berkshire, I think it was,\nwhere he taught reading and writing to ten or a dozen boys, at sixpence\neach per week), recommending Mrs. T---- to my care, and desiring me to\nwrite to him, directing for Mr. Franklin, schoolmaster, at such a place.\n\nHe continued to write frequently, sending me large specimens of an epic\npoem which he was then composing, and desiring my remarks and\ncorrections.  These I gave him from time to time, but endeavor'd rather\nto discourage his proceeding.  One of Young's Satires was then just\npublished.  I copy'd and sent him a great part of it, which set in a\nstrong light the folly of pursuing the Muses with any hope of\nadvancement by them.  All was in vain; sheets of the poem continued to\ncome by every post.  In the mean time, Mrs. T----, having on his\naccount lost her friends and business, was often in distresses, and\nus'd to send for me, and borrow what I could spare to help her out of\nthem.  I grew fond of her company, and, being at that time under no\nreligious restraint, and presuming upon my importance to her, I\nattempted familiarities (another erratum) which she repuls'd with a\nproper resentment, and acquainted him with my behaviour.  This made a\nbreach between us; and, when he returned again to London, he let me\nknow he thought I had cancell'd all the obligations he had been under\nto me.  So I found I was never to expect his repaying me what I lent to\nhim, or advanc'd for him.  This, however, was not then of much\nconsequence, as he was totally unable; and in the loss of his\nfriendship I found myself relieved from a burthen.  I now began to\nthink of getting a little money beforehand, and, expecting better work,\nI left Palmer's to work at Watts's, near Lincoln's Inn Fields, a still\ngreater printing-house. Here I continued all the rest of my stay in\nLondon.\n\nAt my first admission into this printing-house I took to working at\npress, imagining I felt a want of the bodily exercise I had been us'd\nto in America, where presswork is mix'd with composing.  I drank only\nwater; the other workmen, near fifty in number, were great guzzlers of\nbeer.  On occasion, I carried up and down stairs a large form of types\nin each hand, when others carried but one in both hands.  They wondered\nto see, from this and several instances, that the Water-American, as\nthey called me, was stronger than themselves, who drank strong beer!\nWe had an alehouse boy who attended always in the house to supply the\nworkmen.  My companion at the press drank every day a pint before\nbreakfast, a pint at breakfast with his bread and cheese, a pint\nbetween breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint in the afternoon\nabout six o'clock, and another when he had done his day's work.  I\nthought it a detestable custom; but it was necessary, he suppos'd, to\ndrink strong beer, that he might be strong to labor.  I endeavored to\nconvince him that the bodily strength afforded by beer could only be in\nproportion to the grain or flour of the barley dissolved in the water\nof which it was made; that there was more flour in a pennyworth of\nbread; and therefore, if he would eat that with a pint of water, it\nwould give him more strength than a quart of beer.  He drank on,\nhowever, and had four or five shillings to pay out of his wages every\nSaturday night for that muddling liquor; an expense I was free from.\nAnd thus these poor devils keep themselves always under.\n\nWatts, after some weeks, desiring to have me in the composing-room, I\nleft the pressmen; a new bien venu or sum for drink, being five\nshillings, was demanded of me by the compositors.  I thought it an\nimposition, as I had paid below; the master thought so too, and forbad\nmy paying it.  I stood out two or three weeks, was accordingly\nconsidered as an excommunicate, and had so many little pieces of\nprivate mischief done me, by mixing my sorts, transposing my pages,\nbreaking my matter, etc., etc., if I were ever so little out of the\nroom, and all ascribed to the chappel ghost, which they said ever\nhaunted those not regularly admitted, that, notwithstanding the\nmaster's protection, I found myself oblig'd to comply and pay the\nmoney, convinc'd of the folly of being on ill terms with those one is\nto live with continually.\n\nI was now on a fair footing with them, and soon acquir'd considerable\ninfluence.  I propos'd some reasonable alterations in their chappel[4]\nlaws, and carried them against all opposition.  From my example, a\ngreat part of them left their muddling breakfast of beer, and bread,\nand cheese, finding they could with me be suppli'd from a neighboring\nhouse with a large porringer of hot water-gruel, sprinkled with pepper,\ncrumbl'd with bread, and a bit of butter in it, for the price of a pint\nof beer, viz., three half-pence. This was a more comfortable as well as\ncheaper breakfast, and kept their heads clearer.  Those who continued\nsotting with beer all day, were often, by not paying, out of credit at\nthe alehouse, and us'd to make interest with me to get beer; their\nlight, as they phrased it, being out.  I watch'd the pay-table on\nSaturday night, and collected what I stood engag'd for them, having to\npay sometimes near thirty shillings a week on their account.  This, and\nmy being esteem'd a pretty good riggite, that is, a jocular verbal\nsatirist, supported my consequence in the society.  My constant\nattendance (I never making a St. Monday) recommended me to the master;\nand my uncommon quickness at composing occasioned my being put upon all\nwork of dispatch, which was generally better paid.  So I went on now\nvery agreeably.\n\n     [4] \"A printing-house is always called a chapel by the\n         workmen, the origin of which appears to have been that\n         printing was first carried on in England in an ancient\n         chapel converted into a printing-house, and the title\n         has been preserved by tradition.  The bien venu among\n         the printers answers to the terms entrance and footing\n         among mechanics; thus a journeyman, on entering a\n         printing-house, was accustomed to pay one or more gallons\n         of beer for the good of the chapel;  this custom was\n         falling into disuse thirty years ago; it is very properly\n         rejected entirely in the United States.\"--W. T. F.\n\nMy lodging in Little Britain being too remote, I found another in\nDuke-street, opposite to the Romish Chapel.  It was two pair of stairs\nbackwards, at an Italian warehouse.  A widow lady kept the house; she\nhad a daughter, and a maid servant, and a journeyman who attended the\nwarehouse, but lodg'd abroad.  After sending to inquire my character at\nthe house where I last lodg'd she agreed to take me in at the same\nrate, 3s.  6d.  per week; cheaper, as she said, from the protection she\nexpected in having a man lodge in the house.  She was a widow, an\nelderly woman; had been bred a Protestant, being a clergyman's\ndaughter, but was converted to the Catholic religion by her husband,\nwhose memory she much revered; had lived much among people of\ndistinction, and knew a thousand anecdotes of them as far back as the\ntimes of Charles the Second.  She was lame in her knees with the gout,\nand, therefore, seldom stirred out of her room, so sometimes wanted\ncompany; and hers was so highly amusing to me, that I was sure to spend\nan evening with her whenever she desired it.  Our supper was only half\nan anchovy each, on a very little strip of bread and butter, and half a\npint of ale between us; but the entertainment was in her conversation.\nMy always keeping good hours, and giving little trouble in the family,\nmade her unwilling to part with me; so that, when I talk'd of a lodging\nI had heard of, nearer my business, for two shillings a week, which,\nintent as I now was on saving money, made some difference, she bid me\nnot think of it, for she would abate me two shillings a week for the\nfuture; so I remained with her at one shilling and sixpence as long as\nI staid in London.\n\nIn a garret of her house there lived a maiden lady of seventy, in the\nmost retired manner, of whom my landlady gave me this account: that she\nwas a Roman Catholic, had been sent abroad when young, and lodg'd in a\nnunnery with an intent of becoming a nun; but, the country not agreeing\nwith her, she returned to England, where, there being no nunnery, she\nhad vow'd to lead the life of a nun, as near as might be done in those\ncircumstances.  Accordingly, she had given all her estate to charitable\nuses, reserving only twelve pounds a year to live on, and out of this\nsum she still gave a great deal in charity, living herself on\nwater-gruel only, and using no fire but to boil it.  She had lived many\nyears in that garret, being permitted to remain there gratis by\nsuccessive Catholic tenants of the house below, as they deemed it a\nblessing to have her there.  A priest visited her to confess her every\nday.  \"I have ask'd her,\" says my landlady, \"how she, as she liv'd,\ncould possibly find so much employment for a confessor?\"  \"Oh,\" said\nshe, \"it is impossible to avoid vain thoughts.\"  I was permitted once\nto visit her, She was chearful and polite, and convers'd pleasantly.\nThe room was clean, but had no other furniture than a matras, a table\nwith a crucifix and book, a stool which she gave me to sit on, and a\npicture over the chimney of Saint Veronica displaying her handkerchief,\nwith the miraculous figure of Christ's bleeding face on it, which she\nexplained to me with great seriousness.  She look'd pale, but was never\nsick; and I give it as another instance on how small an income life and\nhealth may be supported.\n\nAt Watts's printing-house I contracted an acquaintance with an\ningenious young man, one Wygate, who, having wealthy relations, had\nbeen better educated than most printers; was a tolerable Latinist,\nspoke French, and lov'd reading.  I taught him and a friend of his to\nswim at twice going into the river, and they soon became good swimmers.\nThey introduc'd me to some gentlemen from the country, who went to\nChelsea by water to see the College and Don Saltero's curiosities.  In\nour return, at the request of the company, whose curiosity Wygate had\nexcited, I stripped and leaped into the river, and swam from near\nChelsea to Blackfryar's, performing on the way many feats of activity,\nboth upon and under water, that surpris'd and pleas'd those to whom\nthey were novelties.\n\nI had from a child been ever delighted with this exercise, had studied\nand practis'd all Thevenot's motions and positions, added some of my\nown, aiming at the graceful and easy as well as the useful.  All these\nI took this occasion of exhibiting to the company, and was much\nflatter'd by their admiration; and Wygate, who was desirous of becoming\na master, grew more and more attach'd to me on that account, as well as\nfrom the similarity of our studies.  He at length proposed to me\ntravelling all over Europe together, supporting ourselves everywhere by\nworking at our business.  I was once inclined to it; but, mentioning it\nto my good friend Mr. Denham, with whom I often spent an hour when I\nhad leisure, he dissuaded me from it, advising me to think only of\nreturning to Pennsilvania, which he was now about to do.\n\nI must record one trait of this good man's character.  He had formerly\nbeen in business at Bristol, but failed in debt to a number of people,\ncompounded and went to America.  There, by a close application to\nbusiness as a merchant, he acquir'd a plentiful fortune in a few years.\nReturning to England in the ship with me, he invited his old creditors\nto an entertainment, at which he thank'd them for the easy composition\nthey had favored him with, and, when they expected nothing but the\ntreat, every man at the first remove found under his plate an order on\na banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest.\n\nHe now told me he was about to return to Philadelphia, and should carry\nover a great quantity of goods in order to open a store there.  He\npropos'd to take me over as his clerk, to keep his books, in which he\nwould instruct me, copy his letters, and attend the store.  He added\nthat, as soon as I should be acquainted with mercantile business, he\nwould promote me by sending me with a cargo of flour and bread, etc.,\nto the West Indies, and procure me commissions from others which would\nbe profitable; and, if I manag'd well, would establish me handsomely.\nThe thing pleas'd me; for I was grown tired of London, remembered with\npleasure the happy months I had spent in Pennsylvania, and wish'd again\nto see it; therefore I immediately agreed on the terms of fifty pounds\na year, Pennsylvania money; less, indeed, than my present gettings as a\ncompositor, but affording a better prospect.\n\nI now took leave of printing, as I thought, for ever, and was daily\nemployed in my new business, going about with Mr. Denham among the\ntradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up,\ndoing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all\nwas on board, I had a few days' leisure.  On one of these days, I was,\nto my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir\nWilliam Wyndham, and I waited upon him.  He had heard by some means or\nother of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and of my teaching\nWygate and another young man to swim in a few hours.  He had two sons,\nabout to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught\nswimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely if I would teach them.\nThey were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could\nnot undertake it; but, from this incident, I thought it likely that, if\nI were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get a\ngood deal of money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the\noverture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have\nreturned to America.  After many years, you and I had something of more\nimportance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become\nEarl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.\n\nThus I spent about eighteen months in London; most part of the time I\nwork'd hard at my business, and spent but little upon myself except in\nseeing plays and in books.  My friend Ralph had kept me poor; he owed\nme about twenty-seven pounds, which I was now never likely to receive;\na great sum out of my small earnings!  I lov'd him, notwithstanding,\nfor he had many amiable qualities.  I had by no means improv'd my\nfortune; but I had picked up some very ingenious acquaintance, whose\nconversation was of great advantage to me; and I had read considerably.\n\nWe sail'd from Gravesend on the 23d of July, 1726.  For the incidents\nof the voyage, I refer you to my journal, where you will find them all\nminutely related.  Perhaps the most important part of that journal is\nthe plan[5] to be found in it, which I formed at sea, for regulating my\nfuture conduct in life.  It is the more remarkable, as being formed\nwhen I was so young, and yet being pretty faithfully adhered to quite\nthro' to old age.\n\n     [5] The \"Journal\" was printed by Sparks, from a copy made\n         at Reading in 1787.  But it does not contain the Plan.\n         --Ed.\n\nWe landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry\nalterations.  Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major\nGordon.  I met him walking the streets as a common citizen.  He seem'd\na little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything.  I\nshould have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her\nfriends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my\nletter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was\ndone in my absence.  With him, however, she was never happy, and soon\nparted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name, it\nbeing now said that he had another wife.  He was a worthless fellow,\ntho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends.  He\ngot into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and\ndied there.  Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with\nstationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and\nseem'd to have a great deal of business.\n\nMr. Denham took a store in Water-street, where we open'd our goods; I\nattended the business diligently, studied accounts, and grew, in a\nlittle time, expert at selling.  We lodg'd and, boarded together; he\ncounsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me.  I respected\nand lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in\nthe beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my\ntwenty-first year, we both were taken ill.  My distemper was a\npleurisy, which very nearly carried me off.  I suffered a good deal,\ngave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I\nfound myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now,\nsome time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again.\nI forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length\ncarried him off.  He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a\ntoken of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to the wide\nworld; for the store was taken into the care of his executors, and my\nemployment under him ended.\n\nMy brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return\nto my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wages by\nthe year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that\nhe might better attend his stationer's shop.  I had heard a bad\ncharacter of him in London from his wife and her friends, and was not\nfond of having any more to do with him.  I tri'd for farther employment\nas a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting with any, I clos'd\nagain with Keimer.  I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a\nWelsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest,\nsensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of a\nreader, but given to drink.  Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full\nage, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and\nhumor, but a little idle.  These he had agreed with at extream low\nwages per week, to be rais'd a shilling every three months, as they\nwould deserve by improving in their business; and the expectation of\nthese high wages, to come on hereafter, was what he had drawn them in\nwith.  Meredith was to work at press, Potts at book-binding, which he,\nby agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor\nt'other. John ----, a wild Irishman, brought up to no business, whose\nservice, for four years, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a\nship; he, too, was to be made a pressman.  George Webb, an Oxford\nscholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought, intending\nhim for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry, a\ncountry boy, whom he had taken apprentice.\n\nI soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much\nhigher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap\nhands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they\nbeing all articled to him, he should be able to do without me.  I went\non, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which\nhad been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind\ntheir business and to do it better.\n\nIt was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a\nbought servant.  He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave\nme this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at\na grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars for\nsome apparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited\nplays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in\nprose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers;\nthence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not\nwell satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and become a\nplayer.  At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen\nguineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out of town, hid\nhis gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where, having no\nfriend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent his guineas,\nfound no means of being introduc'd among the players, grew necessitous,\npawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread.  Walking the street very hungry,\nand not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp's bill was put into\nhis hand, offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as\nwould bind themselves to serve in America.\n\nHe went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and\ncame over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become\nof him.  He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion,\nbut idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.\n\nJohn, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very\nagreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer\nincapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something\ndaily.  We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I\nhad two days for reading.  My acquaintance with ingenious people in the\ntown increased.  Keimer himself treated me with great civility and\napparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon,\nwhich I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist.\nHe, however, kindly made no demand of it.\n\nOur printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder\nin America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without\nmuch attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made\nuse of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the matrices in lead,\nAnd thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all deficiencies.  I also\nengrav'd several things on occasion; I made the ink; I was\nwarehouseman, and everything, and, in short, quite a factotum.\n\nBut, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became\nevery day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the\nbusiness; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me\nknow that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an\nabatement.  He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master,\nfrequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an\noutbreaking.  I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience,\nthinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause.  At\nlength a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening\nnear the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was\nthe matter.  Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'd\nout to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding\nsome reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,\nall the neighbors who were looking out on the same occasion being\nwitnesses how I was treated.  He came up immediately into the\nprinting-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both sides,\nhe gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing a wish\nthat he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning.  I told him his wish\nwas unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my\nhat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take\ncare of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings.\n\nMeredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair\nover.  He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling\nthat I should leave the house while he remain'd in it.  He dissuaded me\nfrom returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he\nreminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his\ncreditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold\noften without profit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping\naccounts; that he must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I\nmight profit of.  I objected my want of money.  He then let me know\nthat his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse that\nhad pass'd between them, he was sure would advance money to set us up,\nif I would enter into partnership with him.  \"My time,\" says he, \"will\nbe out with Keimer in the spring; by that time we may have our press\nand types in from London.  I am sensible I am no workman; if you like\nit, your skill in the business shall be set against the stock I\nfurnish, and we will share the profits equally.\"\n\nThe proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and\napprov'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his son,\nhad prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd\nmight break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so\nclosely connected.  I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it\nto a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till\nthey should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could,\nat the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so\nremain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd\nto print some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and\nvarious types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might\nengage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that\nold friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden\npassion, and wishing me to return.  Meredith persuaded me to comply, as\nit would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily\ninstructions; so I return'd, and we went on more smoothly than for some\ntime before.  The New Jersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a\ncopperplate press for it, the first that had been seen in the country;\nI cut several ornaments and checks for the bills.  We went together to\nBurlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received\nso large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head\nmuch longer above water.\n\nAt Burlington I made an acquaintance with many principal people of the\nprovince.  Several of them had been appointed by the Assembly a\ncommittee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were\nprinted than the law directed.  They were therefore, by turns,\nconstantly with us, and generally he who attended, brought with him a\nfriend or two for company.  My mind having been much more improv'd by\nreading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation\nseem'd to be more valu'd. They had me to their houses, introduced me to\ntheir friends, and show'd me much civility; while he, tho' the master,\nwas a little neglected.  In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of\ncommon life, fond of rudely opposing receiv'd opinions, slovenly to\nextream dirtiness, enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a\nlittle knavish withal.\n\nWe continu'd there near three months; and by that time I could reckon\namong my acquired friends, Judge Allen, Samuel Bustill, the secretary\nof the Province, Isaac Pearson, Joseph Cooper, and several of the\nSmiths, members of Assembly, and Isaac Decow, the surveyor-general. The\nlatter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for\nhimself, when young, by wheeling clay for the brick-makers, learned to\nwrite after he was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught\nhim surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate;\nand says he, \"I foresee that you will soon work this man out of\nbusiness, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia.\"  He had not then\nthe least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere.\nThese friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was\nto some of them.  They all continued their regard for me as long as\nthey lived.\n\nBefore I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to\nlet you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and\nmorals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future events of\nmy life.  My parents had early given me religious impressions, and\nbrought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way.  But I\nwas scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as\nI found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt\nof Revelation itself.  Some books against Deism fell into my hands;\nthey were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's\nLectures.  It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary\nto what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which\nwere quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the\nrefutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist.  My arguments\nperverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of\nthem having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least\ncompunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was\nanother freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at\ntimes gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine,\ntho' it might be true, was not very useful.  My London pamphlet, which\nhad for its motto these lines of Dryden:\n\n          \"Whatever is, is right.  Though purblind man\n          Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link:\n          His eyes not carrying to the equal beam,\n          That poises all above;\"\n\nand from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and\npower, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and\nthat vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing,\nappear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I\ndoubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'd into\nmy argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is common in\nmetaphysical reasonings.\n\nI grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings\nbetween man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of\nlife; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my\njournal book, to practice them ever while I lived.  Revelation had\nindeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that,\nthough certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by\nit, or good because it commanded them, yet probably these actions might\nbe forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they\nwere beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of\nthings considered.  And this persuasion, with the kind hand of\nProvidence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favorable\ncircumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro' this\ndangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was sometimes\nin among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father,\nwithout any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been\nexpected from my want of religion.  I say willful, because the\ninstances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them, from my\nyouth, inexperience, and the knavery of others.  I had therefore a\ntolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it properly, and\ndetermin'd to preserve it.\n\nWe had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types\narriv'd from London.  We settled with Keimer, and left him by his\nconsent before he heard of it.  We found a house to hire near the\nmarket, and took it.  To lessen the rent, which was then but\ntwenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for\nseventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were\nto pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them.  We\nhad scarce opened our letters and put our press in order, before George\nHouse, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had\nmet in the street inquiring for a printer.  All our cash was now\nexpended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure,\nand this countryman's five shillings, being our first-fruits, and\ncoming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since\nearned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often more\nready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young\nbeginners.\n\nThere are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin.  Such a\none then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with\na wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel\nMickle.  This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door,\nand asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new\nprinting-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry\nfor me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would\nbe lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already\nhalf-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such\nas new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge\nfallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon\nruin us.  And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or\nthat were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy.  Had I known\nhim before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have\ndone it.  This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to\ndeclaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house\nthere, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the\npleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have\nbought it for when he first began his croaking.\n\nI should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding\nyear, I had form'd most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of\nmutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday\nevenings.  The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his\nturn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals,\nPolitics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss'd by the company; and\nonce in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on\nany subject he pleased.  Our debates were to be under the direction of\na president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after\ntruth, without fondness for dispute, or desire of victory; and, to\nprevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct\ncontradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited\nunder small pecuniary penalties.\n\nThe first members were Joseph Breintnal, a copyer of deeds for the\nscriveners, a good-natur'd, friendly, middle-ag'd man, a great lover of\npoetry, reading all he could meet with, and writing some that was\ntolerable; very ingenious in many little Nicknackeries, and of sensible\nconversation.\n\nThomas Godfrey, a self-taught mathematician, great in his way, and\nafterward inventor of what is now called Hadley's Quadrant.  But he\nknew little out of his way, and was not a pleasing companion; as, like\nmost great mathematicians I have met with, he expected universal\nprecision in everything said, or was for ever denying or distinguishing\nupon trifles, to the disturbance of all conversation.  He soon left us.\n\nNicholas Scull, a surveyor, afterwards surveyor-general, who lov'd\nbooks, and sometimes made a few verses.\n\nWilliam Parsons, bred a shoemaker, but loving reading, had acquir'd a\nconsiderable share of mathematics, which he first studied with a view\nto astrology, that he afterwards laught at it.  He also became\nsurveyor-general.\n\nWilliam Maugridge, a joiner, a most exquisite mechanic, and a solid,\nsensible man.\n\nHugh Meredith, Stephen Potts, and George Webb I have characteriz'd\nbefore.\n\nRobert Grace, a young gentleman of some fortune, generous, lively, and\nwitty; a lover of punning and of his friends.\n\nAnd William Coleman, then a merchant's clerk, about my age, who had the\ncoolest, dearest head, the best heart, and the exactest morals of\nalmost any man I ever met with.  He became afterwards a merchant of\ngreat note, and one of our provincial judges.  Our friendship continued\nwithout interruption to his death, upward of forty years; and the club\ncontinued almost as long, and was the best school of philosophy,\nmorality, and politics that then existed in the province; for our\nqueries, which were read the week preceding their discussion, put us\nupon reading with attention upon the several subjects, that we might\nspeak more to the purpose; and here, too, we acquired better habits of\nconversation, every thing being studied in our rules which might\nprevent our disgusting each other.  From hence the long continuance of\nthe club, which I shall have frequent occasion to speak further of\nhereafter.\n\nBut my giving this account of it here is to show something of the\ninterest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending\nbusiness to us.  Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers\nthe printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done\nby Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was\nlow.  It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes.\nI compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it\nwas often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished\nmy distribution for the next day's work, for the little jobbs sent in\nby our other friends now and then put us back.  But so determin'd I was\nto continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when,\nhaving impos'd my forms, I thought my day's work over, one of them by\naccident was broken, and two pages reduced to pi, I immediately\ndistributed and compos'd it over again before I went to bed; and this\nindustry, visible to our neighbors, began to give us character and\ncredit; particularly, I was told, that mention being made of the new\nprinting-office at the merchants' Every-night club, the general opinion\nwas that it must fail, there being already two printers in the place,\nKeimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after\nat his native place, St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion:\n\"For the industry of that Franklin,\" says he, \"is superior to any thing\nI ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from\nclub, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed.\"\nThis struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of them to\nsupply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in\nshop business.\n\nI mention this industry the more particularly and the more freely, tho'\nit seems to be talking in my own praise, that those of my posterity,\nwho shall read it, may know the use of that virtue, when they see its\neffects in my favour throughout this relation.\n\nGeorge Webb, who had found a female friend that lent him wherewith to\npurchase his time of Keimer, now came to offer himself as a journeyman\nto us.  We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let him know as a\nsecret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have\nwork for him.  My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on\nthis, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry\nthing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable\nto him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good\nencouragement.  I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to\nKeimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals\nfor printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ'd. I resented\nthis; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I\nwrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the\ntitle of the BUSY BODY, which Breintnal continu'd some months.  By this\nmeans the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and\nKeimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were\ndisregarded.  He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on\nthree quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he\noffered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go\non with it, took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years\nextremely profitable to me.\n\nI perceive that I am apt to speak in the singular number, though our\npartnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the whole\nmanagement of the business lay upon me.  Meredith was no compositor, a\npoor pressman, and seldom sober.  My friends lamented my connection\nwith him, but I was to make the best of it.\n\nOur first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in\nthe province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited\nremarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between Governor\nBurnet and the Massachusetts Assembly, struck the principal people,\noccasioned the paper and the manager of it to be much talk'd of, and in\na few weeks brought them all to be our subscribers.\n\nTheir example was follow'd by many, and our number went on growing\ncontinually.  This was one of the first good effects of my having\nlearnt a little to scribble; another was, that the leading men, seeing\na newspaper now in the hands of one who could also handle a pen,\nthought it convenient to oblige and encourage me.  Bradford still\nprinted the votes, and laws, and other publick business.  He had\nprinted an address of the House to the governor, in a coarse,\nblundering manner, we reprinted it elegantly and correctly, and sent\none to every member.  They were sensible of the difference: it\nstrengthened the hands of our friends in the House, and they voted us\ntheir printers for the year ensuing.\n\nAmong my friends in the House I must not forget Mr. Hamilton, before\nmentioned, who was then returned from England, and had a seat in it.\nHe interested himself for me strongly in that instance, as he did in\nmany others afterward, continuing his patronage till his death.[6]\n\n     [6] I got his son once L500.--[Marg. note.]\n\nMr. Vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt I ow'd him, but\ndid not press me.  I wrote him an ingenuous letter of acknowledgment,\ncrav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he allow'd me, and as\nsoon as I was able, I paid the principal with interest, and many\nthanks; so that erratum was in some degree corrected.\n\nBut now another difficulty came upon me which I had never the least\nreason to expect.  Mr. Meredith's father, who was to have paid for our\nprinting-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to\nadvance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a\nhundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us\nall.  We gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in\ntime, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our\nhopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters\nmust be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.\n\nIn this distress two true friends, whose kindness I have never\nforgotten, nor ever shall forget while I can remember any thing, came\nto me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application\nfrom me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should\nbe necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if\nthat should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the\npartnership with Meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in\nthe streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our\ndiscredit.  These two friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace.  I\ntold them I could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd\nof the Merediths' fulfilling their part of our agreement, because I\nthought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,\nand would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their\nperformance, and our partnership must be dissolv'd, I should then think\nmyself at liberty to accept the assistance of my friends.\n\nThus the matter rested for some time, when I said to my partner,\n\"Perhaps your father is dissatisfied at the part you have undertaken in\nthis affair of ours, and is unwilling to advance for you and me what he\nwould for you alone.  If that is the case, tell me, and I will resign\nthe whole to you, and go about my business.\" \"No,\" said he, \"my father\nhas really been disappointed, and is really unable; and I am unwilling\nto distress him farther.  I see this is a business I am not fit for.  I\nwas bred a farmer, and it was a folly in me to come to town, and put\nmyself, at thirty years of age, an apprentice to learn a new trade.\nMany of our Welsh people are going to settle in North Carolina, where\nland is cheap.  I am inclin'd to go with them, and follow my old\nemployment.  You may find friends to assist you.  If you will take the\ndebts of the company upon you; return to my father the hundred pound he\nhas advanced; pay my little personal debts, and give me thirty pounds\nand a new saddle, I will relinquish the partnership, and leave the\nwhole in your hands.\"  I agreed to this proposal: it was drawn up in\nwriting, sign'd, and seal'd immediately.  I gave him what he demanded,\nand he went soon after to Carolina, from whence he sent me next year\ntwo long letters, containing the best account that had been given of\nthat country, the climate, the soil, husbandry, etc., for in those\nmatters he was very judicious.  I printed them in the papers, and they\ngave great satisfaction to the publick.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, I recurr'd to my two friends; and because I\nwould not give an unkind preference to either, I took half of what each\nhad offered and I wanted of one, and half of the other; paid off the\ncompany's debts, and went on with the business in my own name,\nadvertising that the partnership was dissolved.  I think this was in or\nabout the year 1729.\n\nAbout this time there was a cry among the people for more paper money,\nonly fifteen thousand pounds being extant in the province, and that\nsoon to be sunk.  The wealthy inhabitants oppos'd any addition, being\nagainst all paper currency, from an apprehension that it would\ndepreciate, as it had done in New England, to the prejudice of all\ncreditors.  We had discuss'd this point in our Junto, where I was on\nthe side of an addition, being persuaded that the first small sum\nstruck in 1723 had done much good by increasing the trade, employment,\nand number of inhabitants in the province, since I now saw all the old\nhouses inhabited, and many new ones building; whereas I remembered\nwell, that when I first walk'd about the streets of Philadelphia,\neating my roll, I saw most of the houses in Walnut-street, between\nSecond and Front streets, with bills on their doors, \"To be let\"; and\nmany likewise in Chestnut-street and other streets, which made me then\nthink the inhabitants of the city were deserting it one after another.\n\nOur debates possess'd me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and\nprinted an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled \"The Nature and Necessity\nof a Paper Currency.\"  It was well receiv'd by the common people in\ngeneral; but the rich men dislik'd it, for it increas'd and\nstrengthen'd the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no\nwriters among them that were able to answer it, their opposition\nslacken'd, and the point was carried by a majority in the House.  My\nfriends there, who conceiv'd I had been of some service, thought fit to\nreward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable jobb\nand a great help to me.  This was another advantage gain'd by my being\nable to write.\n\nThe utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident\nas never afterwards to be much disputed; so that it grew soon to\nfifty-five thousand pounds, and in 1739 to eighty thousand pounds,\nsince which it arose during war to upwards of three hundred and fifty\nthousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while\nincreasing, till I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity\nmay be hurtful.\n\nI soon after obtain'd, thro' my friend Hamilton, the printing of the\nNewcastle paper money, another profitable jobb as I then thought it;\nsmall things appearing great to those in small circumstances; and\nthese, to me, were really great advantages, as they were great\nencouragements.  He procured for me, also, the printing of the laws and\nvotes of that government, which continu'd in my hands as long as I\nfollow'd the business.\n\nI now open'd a little stationer's shop.  I had in it blanks of all\nsorts, the correctest that ever appear'd among us, being assisted in\nthat by my friend Breintnal.  I had also paper, parchment, chapmen's\nbooks, etc.  One Whitemash, a compositor I had known in London, an\nexcellent workman, now came to me, and work'd with me constantly and\ndiligently; and I took an apprentice, the son of Aquila Rose.\n\nI began now gradually to pay off the debt I was under for the\nprinting-house. In order to secure my credit and character as a\ntradesman, I took care not only to be in reality industrious and\nfrugal, but to avoid all appearances to the contrary.  I drest plainly;\nI was seen at no places of idle diversion.  I never went out a fishing\nor shooting; a book, indeed, sometimes debauch'd me from my work, but\nthat was seldom, snug, and gave no scandal; and, to show that I was not\nabove my business, I sometimes brought home the paper I purchas'd at\nthe stores thro' the streets on a wheelbarrow.  Thus being esteem'd an\nindustrious, thriving young man, and paying duly for what I bought, the\nmerchants who imported stationery solicited my custom; others proposed\nsupplying me with books, and I went on swimmingly.  In the mean time,\nKeimer's credit and business declining daily, he was at last forc'd to\nsell his printing house to satisfy his creditors.  He went to\nBarbadoes, and there lived some years in very poor circumstances.\n\nHis apprentice, David Harry, whom I had instructed while I work'd with\nhim, set up in his place at Philadelphia, having bought his materials.\nI was at first apprehensive of a powerful rival in Harry, as his\nfriends were very able, and had a good deal of interest.  I therefore\npropos'd a partner-ship to him which he, fortunately for me, rejected\nwith scorn.  He was very proud, dress'd like a gentleman, liv'd\nexpensively, took much diversion and pleasure abroad, ran in debt, and\nneglected his business; upon which, all business left him; and, finding\nnothing to do, he followed Keimer to Barbadoes, taking the\nprinting-house with him.  There this apprentice employ'd his former\nmaster as a journeyman; they quarrel'd often; Harry went continually\nbehindhand, and at length was forc'd to sell his types and return to\nhis country work in Pensilvania.  The person that bought them employ'd\nKeimer to use them, but in a few years he died.\n\nThere remained now no competitor with me at Philadelphia but the old\none, Bradford; who was rich and easy, did a little printing now and\nthen by straggling hands, but was not very anxious about the business.\nHowever, as he kept the post-office, it was imagined he had better\nopportunities of obtaining news; his paper was thought a better\ndistributer of advertisements than mine, and therefore had many, more,\nwhich was a profitable thing to him, and a disadvantage to me; for,\ntho' I did indeed receive and send papers by the post, yet the publick\nopinion was otherwise, for what I did send was by bribing the riders,\nwho took them privately, Bradford being unkind enough to forbid it,\nwhich occasion'd some resentment on my part; and I thought so meanly of\nhim for it, that, when I afterward came into his situation, I took care\nnever to imitate it.\n\nI had hitherto continu'd to board with Godfrey, who lived in part of my\nhouse with his wife and children, and had one side of the shop for his\nglazier's business, tho' he worked little, being always absorbed in his\nmathematics.  Mrs. Godfrey projected a match for me with a relation's\ndaughter, took opportunities of bringing us often together, till a\nserious courtship on my part ensu'd, the girl being in herself very\ndeserving.  The old folks encourag'd me by continual invitations to\nsupper, and by leaving us together, till at length it was time to\nexplain.  Mrs. Godfrey manag'd our little treaty.  I let her know that\nI expected as much money with their daughter as would pay off my\nremaining debt for the printing-house, which I believe was not then\nabove a hundred pounds.  She brought me word they had no such sum to\nspare; I said they might mortgage their house in the loan-office. The\nanswer to this, after some days, was, that they did not approve the\nmatch; that, on inquiry of Bradford, they had been inform'd the\nprinting business was not a profitable one; the types would soon be\nworn out, and more wanted; that S. Keimer and D. Harry had failed one\nafter the other, and I should probably soon follow them; and,\ntherefore, I was forbidden the house, and the daughter shut up.\n\nWhether this was a real change of sentiment or only artifice, on a\nsupposition of our being too far engaged in affection to retract, and\ntherefore that we should steal a marriage, which would leave them at\nliberty to give or withhold what they pleas'd, I know not; but I\nsuspected the latter, resented it, and went no more.  Mrs. Godfrey\nbrought me afterward some more favorable accounts of their disposition,\nand would have drawn me on again; but I declared absolutely my\nresolution to have nothing more to do with that family.  This was\nresented by the Godfreys; we differ'd, and they removed, leaving me the\nwhole house, and I resolved to take no more inmates.\n\nBut this affair having turned my thoughts to marriage, I look'd round\nme and made overtures of acquaintance in other places; but soon found\nthat, the business of a printer being generally thought a poor one, I\nwas not to expect money with a wife, unless with such a one as I should\nnot otherwise think agreeable.  In the mean time, that\nhard-to-be-governed passion of youth hurried me frequently into\nintrigues with low women that fell in my way, which were attended with\nsome expense and great inconvenience, besides a continual risque to my\nhealth by a distemper which of all things I dreaded, though by great\ngood luck I escaped it.  A friendly correspondence as neighbors and old\nacquaintances had continued between me and Mrs. Read's family, who all\nhad a regard for me from the time of my first lodging in their house.\nI was often invited there and consulted in their affairs, wherein I\nsometimes was of service.  I piti'd poor Miss Read's unfortunate\nsituation, who was generally dejected, seldom cheerful, and avoided\ncompany.  I considered my giddiness and inconstancy when in London as\nin a great degree the cause of her unhappiness, tho' the mother was\ngood enough to think the fault more her own than mine, as she had\nprevented our marrying before I went thither, and persuaded the other\nmatch in my absence.  Our mutual affection was revived, but there were\nnow great objections to our union.  The match was indeed looked upon as\ninvalid, a preceding wife being said to be living in England; but this\ncould not easily be prov'd, because of the distance; and, tho' there\nwas a report of his death, it was not certain.  Then, tho' it should be\ntrue, he had left many debts, which his successor might be call'd upon\nto pay.  We ventured, however, over all these difficulties, and I took\nher to wife, September 1st, 1730.  None of the inconveniences happened\nthat we had apprehended, she proved a good and faithful helpmate,\nassisted me much by attending the shop; we throve together, and have\never mutually endeavored to make each other happy.  Thus I corrected\nthat great erratum as well as I could.\n\nAbout this time, our club meeting, not at a tavern, but in a little\nroom of Mr. Grace's, set apart for that purpose, a proposition was made\nby me, that, since our books were often referr'd to in our\ndisquisitions upon the queries, it might be convenient to us to have\nthem altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be\nconsulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we\nshould, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the\nadvantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be\nnearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.  It was lik'd and\nagreed to, and we fill'd one end of the room with such books as we\ncould best spare.  The number was not so great as we expected; and tho'\nthey had been of great use, yet some inconveniences occurring for want\nof due care of them, the collection, after about a year, was separated,\nand each took his books home again\n\nAnd now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a\nsubscription library.  I drew up the proposals, got them put into form\nby our great scrivener, Brockden, and, by the help of my friends in the\nJunto, procured fifty subscribers of forty shillings each to begin\nwith, and ten shillings a year for fifty years, the term our company\nwas to continue.  We afterwards obtain'd a charter, the company being\nincreased to one hundred:  this was the mother of all the North\nAmerican subscription libraries, now so numerous.  It is become a great\nthing itself, and continually increasing.  These libraries have\nimproved the general conversation of the Americans, made the common\ntradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other\ncountries, and perhaps have contributed in some degree to the stand so\ngenerally made throughout the colonies in defense of their privileges.\n\nMemo.  Thus far was written with the intention express'd in the\nbeginning and therefore contains several little family anecdotes of no\nimportance to others.  What follows was written many years after in\ncompliance with the advice contain'd in these letters, and accordingly\nintended for the public.  The affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the\ninterruption.\n\n     Letter from Mr. Abel James, with Notes of my Life\n                    (received in Paris).\n\n\"MY DEAR AND HONORED FRIEND:  I have often been desirous of writing to\nthee, but could not be reconciled to the thought that the letter might\nfall into the hands of the British, lest some printer or busy-body\nshould publish some part of the contents, and give our friend pain, and\nmyself censure.\n\n\"Some time since there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about\ntwenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, containing an account of\nthe parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending in the\nyear 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy writing; a copy\nof which I inclose, in hopes it may be a means, if thou continued it up\nto a later period, that the first and latter part may be put together;\nand if it is not yet continued, I hope thee will not delay it.  Life is\nuncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if\nkind, humane, and benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends\nand the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work\nwhich would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to\nmillions?  The influence writings under that class have on the minds of\nyouth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our\npublic friend's journals.  It almost insensibly leads the youth into\nthe resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the\njournalist.  Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it\ncould not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and\ntemperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would\nsuch a work be!  I know of no character living, nor many of them put\ntogether, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater\nspirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and\ntemperance with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would\nhave no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is\nof such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\"\n\n\nThe foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a\nfriend, I received from him the following:\n\n     Letter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.\n                                 \"PARIS, January 31, 1783.\n\n\"My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the\nprincipal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker\nacquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my\nreasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as\nhe desired.  Various concerns have for some time past prevented this\nletter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth any\nexpectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall\nby writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I\nam inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall\nonly tell you how I would address any other person, who was as good and\nas great as yourself, but less diffident.  I would say to him, Sir, I\nsolicit the history of your life from the following motives:  Your\nhistory is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else\nwill certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as\nyour own management of the thing might do good.  It will moreover\npresent a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which\nwill very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly\nminds.  And considering the eagerness with which such information is\nsought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a\nmore efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.  All\nthat has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the\nmanners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not\nthink that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting\nto a true judge of human nature and society.  But these, sir, are small\nreasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will\ngive for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your\nArt of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features\nof private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both\npublic and domestic.  The two works I allude to, sir, will in\nparticular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and\nother education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a\nclumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple,\nand the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left\ndestitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a\nreasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a\nman's private power, will be invaluable!  Influence upon the private\ncharacter, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a\nweak influence.  It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and\nprejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession,\npursuits and matrimony.  In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in\nyouth the education even of the next generation is given; in youth the\nprivate and public character is determined; and the term of life\nextending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from youth,\nand more especially before we take our party as to our principal\nobjects.  But your biography will not merely teach self-education, but\nthe education of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and\nimprove his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise\nman.  And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see\nour race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide in\nthis particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then, sir, how\nmuch is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite all wise men\nto become like yourself, and other men to become wise.  When we see how\ncruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race, and how absurd\ndistinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it will be instructive\nto observe the instances multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and\nto find how compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet\ngood-humored.\n\n\"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will\nhave considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence\nin ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted\nin these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many\nthings that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them\na chance of becoming wise by foresight.  The nearest thing to having\nexperience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought\nbefore us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from\nyour pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or\nimportance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have\nconducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting\ndiscussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of\nexperiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than\nhuman life?\n\n\"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated\nfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you,\nsir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the\nsame moment, wise, practical and good, your account of yourself (for I\nsuppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only\nin point of character, but of private history) will show that you are\nashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how\nlittle necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness.  As\nno end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that\neven you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but\nat the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the\nmeans are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon\nnature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be\nthe propriety of everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the\nstage of the world.  Our sensations being very much fixed to the\nmoment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first,\nand consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the\nwhole of a life.  Your attribution appears to have been applied to your\nlife, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content\nand enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or\nregrets.  Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and\nthemselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom\npatience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent,\nsir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling\nDr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which\nhe considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singular that he\nshould have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without\nwhich you never could have waited for your advancement, or found your\nsituation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to\nshow the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds.\nIf this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well\nas I do, he would have said, Your former writings and measures would\nsecure attention to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your\nBiography and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them.\nThis is an advantage attendant upon a various character, and which\nbrings all that belongs to it into greater play; and it is the more\nuseful, as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of\nimproving their minds and characters, than they are for the time or the\ninclination to do it.  But there is one concluding reflection, sir,\nthat will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography.  This\nstyle of writing seems a little gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very\nuseful one; and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable, as\nit will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public\ncutthroats and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or\nvain literary triflers.  If it encourages more writings of the same\nkind with your own, and induces more men to spend lives fit to be\nwritten, it will be worth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being\ntired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits\nonly one man in the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall\nend my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to\nyour proper self.  I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you\nshould let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as\ncivil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering\nyour great age, the caution of your character, and your peculiar style\nof thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be\nsufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of\nyour mind.  Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present\nperiod, will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it,\nand when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be\nhighly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your\nown character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it is\nproper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country, as well\nas upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand respectable and\neternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always\nmaintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at\npresent a vicious and detestable animal; and still more to prove that\ngood management may greatly amend him; and it is for much the same\nreason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established, that there\nare fair characters existing among the individuals of the race; for the\nmoment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived abandoned,\ngood people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think\nof taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it\ncomfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir, this\nwork most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good;\ntemperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourself as\none, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord, in\na way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted, as\nwe have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life.  Let\nEnglishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.  When\nthey think well of individuals in your native country, they will go\nnearer to thinking well of your country; and when your countrymen see\nthemselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer to\nthinking well of England.  Extend your views even further; do not stop\nat those who speak the English tongue, but after having settled so many\npoints in nature and politics, think of bettering the whole race of\nmen.  As I have not read any part of the life in question, but know\nonly the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard.  I am\nsure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art\nof Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and\nstill more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances\nto the several views above stated.  Should they even prove unsuccessful\nin all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at\nleast have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives\na feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the\nfair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much\ninjured by pain.  In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the\nprayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my\ndearest sir, etc., etc.,\n\n     \"Signed, BENJ. VAUGHAN.\"\n\n\n\nContinuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,\n1784.\n\nIt is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too\nbusy till now to think of complying with the request they contain.  It\nmight, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers,\nwhich would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return\nbeing uncertain and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavor\nto recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it may there\nbe corrected and improv'd.\n\nNot having any copy here of what is already written, I know not whether\nan account is given of the means I used to establish the Philadelphia\npublic library, which, from a small beginning, is now become so\nconsiderable, though I remember to have come down to near the time of\nthat transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with an account of\nit, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.\n\nAt the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good\nbookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston.\nIn New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold\nonly paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books.\nThose who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from\nEngland; the members of the Junto had each a few.  We had left the\nalehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in.  I\npropos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where\nthey would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become\na common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he\nwish'd to read at home.  This was accordingly done, and for some time\ncontented us.\n\nFinding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render\nthe benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription\nlibrary.  I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be\nnecessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put\nthe whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which\neach subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first\npurchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them.  So\nfew were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of\nus so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than\nfifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this\npurpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum.  On this\nlittle fund we began.  The books were imported; the library was opened\none day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory\nnotes to pay double the value if not duly returned.  The institution\nsoon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other\nprovinces.  The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became\nfashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert\ntheir attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in\na few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more\nintelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other\ncountries.\n\nWhen we were about to sign the above-mentioned articles, which were to\nbe binding upon us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the\nscrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable\nthat any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in\nthe instrument.\"  A number of us, however, are yet living; but the\ninstrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that\nincorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.\n\nThe objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the\nsubscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's\nself as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to\nraise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's\nneighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that\nproject.  I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and\nstated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to\ngo about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading.  In\nthis way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it\non such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily\nrecommend it.  The present little sacrifice of your vanity will\nafterwards be amply repaid.  If it remains a while uncertain to whom\nthe merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged\nto claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by\nplucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right\nowner.\n\nThis library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study,\nfor which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in\nsome degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended\nfor me.  Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself.  I spent no\ntime in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my\nbusiness continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary.  I was\nindebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be\neducated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were\nestablished in the place before me.  My circumstances, however, grew\ndaily easier.  My original habits of frugality continuing, and my\nfather having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently\nrepeated a proverb of Solomon, \"Seest thou a man diligent in his\ncalling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean\nmen,\" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth\nand distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I\nshould ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since\nhappened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of\nsitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.\n\nWe have an English proverb that says, \"He that would thrive, must ask\nhis wife.\"  It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to\nindustry and frugality as myself.  She assisted me cheerfully in my\nbusiness, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old\nlinen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc.  We kept no idle servants,\nour table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest.  For\ninstance, my breakfast was a long time bread and milk (no tea), and I\nate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon.  But\nmark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of\nprinciple:  being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a\nChina bowl, with a spoon of silver!  They had been bought for me\nwithout my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of\nthree-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse or\napology to make, but that she thought her husband deserv'd a silver\nspoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors.  This was the\nfirst appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a\ncourse of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to\nseveral hundred pounds in value.\n\nI had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho' some of the\ndogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God,\nelection, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others\ndoubtful, and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the\nsect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious\nprinciples.  I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity;\nthat he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the\nmost acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our\nsouls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue\nrewarded, either here or hereafter.  These I esteem'd the essentials of\nevery religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in\nour country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of\nrespect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which,\nwithout any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd\nprincipally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another.  This\nrespect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects,\ninduc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good\nopinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province\nincreas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted,\nand generally erected by voluntary contributions, my mite for such\npurpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.\n\nTho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of\nits propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I\nregularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only\nPresbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia.  He us'd to\nvisit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish me to attend his\nadministrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for\nfive Sundays successively.  Had he been in my opinion a good preacher,\nperhaps I might have continued, notwithstanding the occasion I had for\nthe Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were\nchiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar\ndoctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and\nunedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or\nenforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than\ngood citizens.\n\nAt length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of\nPhilippians, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest,\njust, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any\npraise, think on these things.\"  And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a\ntext, we could not miss of having some morality.  But he confin'd\nhimself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1.  Keeping\nholy the Sabbath day.  2.  Being diligent in reading the holy\nScriptures.  3.  Attending duly the publick worship.  4.  Partaking of\nthe Sacrament.  5.  Paying a due respect to God's ministers.  These\nmight be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things\nthat I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them\nfrom any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more.  I\nhad some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for\nmy own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and\nActs of Religion.  I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to\nthe public assemblies.  My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it,\nwithout attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to\nrelate facts, and not to make apologies for them.\n\nIt was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of\narriving at moral perfection.  I wish'd to live without committing any\nfault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination,\ncustom, or company might lead me into.  As I knew, or thought I knew,\nwhat was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the\none and avoid the other.  But I soon found I had undertaken a task of\nmore difficulty than I had imagined.  While my care was employ'd in\nguarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit\ntook the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong\nfor reason.  I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative\nconviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not\nsufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must\nbe broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have\nany dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct.  For this\npurpose I therefore contrived the following method.\n\nIn the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my\nreading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different\nwriters included more or fewer ideas under the same name.  Temperance,\nfor example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by\nothers it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure,\nappetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our\navarice and ambition.  I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness,\nto use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few\nnames with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues\nall that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and\nannexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I\ngave to its meaning.\n\nThese names of virtues, with their precepts, were:\n\n1.  TEMPERANCE.  Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n\n2.  SILENCE.  Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid\ntrifling conversation.\n\n3.  ORDER.  Let all your things have their places; let each part of\nyour business have its time.\n\n4.  RESOLUTION.  Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without\nfail what you resolve.\n\n5.  FRUGALITY.  Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself;\ni.e., waste nothing.\n\n6.  INDUSTRY.  Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful;\ncut off all unnecessary actions.\n\n7.  SINCERITY.  Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly,\nand, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n\n8.  JUSTICE.  Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits\nthat are your duty.\n\n9.  MODERATION.  Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as\nyou think they deserve.\n\n10.  CLEANLINESS.  Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or\nhabitation.\n\n11.  TRANQUILLITY.  Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common\nor unavoidable.\n\n12.  CHASTITY.  Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to\ndulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or\nreputation.\n\n13.  HUMILITY.  Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nMy intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I\njudg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the\nwhole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I\nshould be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I\nshould have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition\nof some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd\nthem with that view, as they stand above.  Temperance first, as it\ntends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so\nnecessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard\nmaintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and\nthe force of perpetual temptations.  This being acquir'd and\nestablish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain\nknowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering\nthat in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than\nof the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting\ninto of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable\nto trifling company, I gave Silence the second place.  This and the\nnext, Order, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my\nproject and my studies.  Resolution, once become habitual, would keep\nme firm in my endeavors to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality\nand Industry freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence\nand independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and\nJustice, etc., etc.  Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of\nPythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary,\nI contrived the following method for conducting that examination.\n\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the\nvirtues.  I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns,\none for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the\nday.  I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the\nbeginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on\nwhich line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black\nspot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed\nrespecting that virtue upon that day.\n\nForm of the pages.\n\n           +-------------------------------+\n\n           |              TEMPERANCE.      |\n\n           |       EAT NOT TO DULNESS;     |\n\n           |     DRINK NOT TO ELEVATION.   |\n\n           |   | S.| M.| T.| W.| T.| F.| S.|\n\n           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\n           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | S.| * | * |   | * |   | * |   |\n\n           | O.| **| * | * |   | * | * | * |\n\n           | R.|   |   | * |   |   | * |   |\n\n           | F.|   | * |   |   | * |   |   |\n\n           | I.|   |   | * |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | S.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | J.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | M.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | T.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | C.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           | H.|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n\n           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n\nI determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues\nsuccessively.  Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid\nevery the least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues\nto their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the\nday.  Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T,\nclear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much\nstrengthen'd and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending\nmy attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both\nlines clear of spots.  Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a\ncourse compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year.  And\nlike him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate\nall the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his\nstrength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having\naccomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I\nhoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I\nmade in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till\nin the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a\nclean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.\n\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:\n\n          \"Here will I hold.  If there's a power above us\n          (And that there is all nature cries aloud\n          Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\n          And that which he delights in must be happy.\"\n\nAnother from Cicero,\n\n          \"O vitae Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix\n          expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex praeceptis\n          tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.\"\n\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\n\n          \"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand\n          riches and honour.  Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\n          and all her paths are peace.\" iii. 16, 17.\n\nAnd conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and\nnecessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I\nformed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of\nexamination, for daily use.\n\n\"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! increase in me\nthat wisdom which discovers my truest interest! strengthen my\nresolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates.  Accept my kind\noffices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy\ncontinual favors to me.\"\n\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's\nPoems, viz.:\n\n          \"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\n          O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\n          Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,\n          From every low pursuit; and fill my soul\n          With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\n          Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!\"\n\nThe precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should\nhave its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd the\nfollowing scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural\nday:\n\n       THE MORNING.            {  5 } Rise, wash, and address\n                               {    } Powerful Goodness!  Contrive\n  Question.  What good  shall  {  6 } day's business, and take the\n  I do this day?               {    } resolution of the day; prosecute\n                               {  7 } the present study, and\n                               {    } breakfast.\n                                  8 }\n                                  9 } Work.\n                                 10 }\n                                 11 }\n\n       NOON.                   { 12 } Read, or overlook my\n                               {  1 } accounts, and dine.\n                                  2 }\n                                  3 } Work.\n                                  4 }\n                                  5 }\n\n       EVENING.                {  6 } Put things in their places.\n                               {  7 } Supper.  Music or diversion,\n  Question.  What good have    {  8 } or conversation.  Examination\n  I done to-day?               {  9 } of the day.\n                               { 10 }\n                               { 11 }\n                               { 12 }\n\n       NIGHT.                  {  1 } Sleep.\n                               {  2 }\n                               {  3 }\n                               {  4 }\n\nI enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and\ncontinu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time.  I was\nsurpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined;\nbut I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish.  To avoid the\ntrouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out\nthe marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new\ncourse, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to\nthe ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn\nwith red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my\nfaults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out\nwith a wet sponge.  After a while I went thro' one course only in a\nyear, and afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted\nthem entirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a\nmultiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little\nbook with me.\n\nMy scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho' it\nmight be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him\nthe disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for\ninstance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who\nmust mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their\nown hours.  Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc.,\nI found extreamly difficult to acquire.  I had not been early\naccustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so\nsensible of the inconvenience attending want of method.  This article,\ntherefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed\nme so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such\nfrequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and\ncontent myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man\nwho, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to have the\nwhole of its surface as bright as the edge.  The smith consented to\ngrind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while\nthe smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the\nstone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing.  The man came every\nnow and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length\nwould take his ax as it was, without farther grinding.  \"No,\" said the\nsmith, \"turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it\nis only speckled.\" \"Yes,\" said the man, \"but I think I like a speckled\nax best.\" And I believe this may have been the case with many, who,\nhaving, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty\nof obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and\nvirtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that \"a speckled ax\nwas best\"; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now\nand then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I exacted of\nmyself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known,\nwould make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended\nwith the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent\nman should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in\ncountenance.\n\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I\nam grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it.\nBut, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so\nambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the\nendeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been\nif I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by\nimitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for\nexcellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and\nis tolerable while it continues fair and legible.\n\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little\nartifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant\nfelicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.\nWhat reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence;\nbut, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to\nhelp his bearing them with more resignation.  To Temperance he ascribes\nhis long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good\nconstitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his\ncircumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge\nthat enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some\ndegree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the\nconfidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon\nhim; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even\nin the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness\nof temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his\ncompany still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger\nacquaintance.  I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may\nfollow the example and reap the benefit.\n\nIt will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without\nreligion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets\nof any particular sect.  I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully\npersuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might\nbe serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or\nother to publish it, I would not have any thing in it that should\nprejudice any one, of any sect, against it.  I purposed writing a\nlittle comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the\nadvantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite\nvice; and I should have called my book THE ART OF VIRTUE,[7] because it\nwould have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would\nhave distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does\nnot instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of\nverbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or\nwhere they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and\nclothed.--James ii.  15, 16.\n\n     [7] Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.\n         --[Marg. note.]\n\nBut it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this\ncomment was never fulfilled.  I did, indeed, from time to time, put\ndown short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of\nin it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close\nattention to private business in the earlier part of thy life, and\npublic business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being\nconnected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required\nthe whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs\nprevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.\n\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine,\nthat vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but\nforbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered;\nthat it was, therefore, every one's interest to be virtuous who wish'd\nto be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance\n(there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility,\nstates, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the\nmanagement of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavored\nto convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a\npoor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity.\n\nMy list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend\nhaving kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my\npride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content\nwith being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing,\nand rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several\ninstances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of\nthis vice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list,\ngiving an extensive meaning to the word.\n\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue,\nbut I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it.  I made it a\nrule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others,\nand all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbid myself, agreeably\nto the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in\nthe language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly,\nundoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I\napprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me\nat present.  When another asserted something that I thought an error, I\ndeny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of\nshowing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering\nI began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion\nwould be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me\nsome difference, etc.  I soon found the advantage of this change in my\nmanner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly.  The\nmodest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier\nreception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was\nfound to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to\ngive up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the\nright.\n\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural\ninclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that\nperhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical\nexpression escape me.  And to this habit (after my character of\nintegrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight\nwith my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or\nalterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I\nbecame a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject\nto much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language,\nand yet I generally carried my points.\n\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard\nto subdue as pride.  Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down,\nstifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and\nwill every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it,\nperhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I\nhad compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\n\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\n\n[\"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but can not have the\nhelp expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war.  I\nhave, however, found the following.\"][8]\n\n     [8]This is a marginal memorandum.--B.\n\nHAVING mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd,\nit seems proper that some account should be here given of that project\nand its object.  Its first rise in my mind appears in the following\nlittle paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:\n\nObservations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\n\n\"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are\ncarried on and affected by parties.\n\n\"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or\nwhat they take to be such.\n\n\"That the different views of these different parties occasion all\nconfusion.\n\n\"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his\nparticular private interest in view.\n\n\"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member\nbecomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others,\nbreaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\n\n\"That few in public affairs act from a meer view of the good of their\ncountry, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real\ngood to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and\ntheir country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle\nof benevolence.\n\n\"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of\nmankind.\n\n\"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United\nParty for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations\ninto a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules,\nwhich good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their\nobedience to, than common people are to common laws.\n\n\"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well\nqualified, can not fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\nB. F.\"\n\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when\nmy circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down\nfrom time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me\nrespecting it.  Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be\nthe substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the\nessentials of every known religion, and being free of every thing that\nmight shock the professors of any religion.  It is express'd in these\nwords, viz.:\n\n\"That there is one God, who made all things.\n\n\"That he governs the world by his providence.\n\n\"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.\n\n\"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\n\n\"That the soul is immortal.\n\n\"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice either here\nor hereafter.\"[9]\n\n     [9] In the Middle Ages, Franklin, if such a phenomenon as\n         Franklin were possible in the Middle Ages, would\n         probably have been the founder of a monastic order.--B.\n\nMy ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at\nfirst among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated\nshould not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have\nexercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of\nthe virtues, as in the before-mention'd model; that the existence of\nsuch a society should be kept a secret, till it was become\nconsiderable, to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper\npersons, but that the members should each of them search among his\nacquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent\ncaution, the scheme should be gradually communicated; that the members\nshould engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to each\nother in promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement\nin life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the\nFree and Easy:  free, as being, by the general practice and habit of\nthe virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the\npractice of industry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man\nto confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.\n\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I\ncommunicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some\nenthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was\nunder of sticking close to my business, occasion'd my postponing the\nfurther prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious\noccupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so\nthat it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity\nleft sufficient for such an enterprise; tho' I am still of opinion that\nit was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by\nforming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by\nthe seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that\none man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish\ngreat affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and,\ncutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his\nattention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and\nbusiness.\n\nIn 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard\nSaunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly\ncall'd Poor Richard's Almanac.  I endeavor'd to make it both\nentertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand,\nthat I reap'd considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten\nthousand.  And observing that it was generally read, scarce any\nneighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as a\nproper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who\nbought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little\nspaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar with\nproverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and\nfrugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing\nvirtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always\nhonestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, it is hard for an\nempty sack to stand up-right.\n\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I\nassembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the\nAlmanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people\nattending an auction.  The bringing all these scatter'd counsels thus\ninto a focus enabled them to make greater impression.  The piece, being\nuniversally approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the\nContinent; reprinted in Britain on a broad side, to be stuck up in\nhouses; two translations were made of it in French, and great numbers\nbought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute gratis among their poor\nparishioners and tenants.  In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless\nexpense in foreign superfluities, some thought it had its share of\ninfluence in producing that growing plenty of money which was\nobservable for several years after its publication.\n\nI considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating\ninstruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from\nthe Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little\npieces of my own, which had been first compos'd for reading in our\nJunto.  Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that,\nwhatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not\nproperly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial,\nshowing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude,\nand was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations.  These may\nbe found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.\n\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libelling and\npersonal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our\ncountry.  Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and\nthe writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press,\nand that a newspaper was like a stagecoach, in which any one who would\npay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece\nseparately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he\npleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to\nspread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers\nto furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I\ncould not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had\nno concern, without doing them manifest injustice.  Now, many of our\nprinters make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by\nfalse accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting\nanimosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so\nindiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of\nneighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national\nallies, which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences.\nThese things I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they\nmay be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their\nprofession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may\nsee by my example that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole,\nbe injurious to their interests.\n\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina,\nwhere a printer was wanting.  I furnish'd him with a press and letters,\non an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of\nthe profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense.  He was a\nman of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and,\ntho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him,\nnor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived.  On his\ndecease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being born and\nbred in Holland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of\naccounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as\nclear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but continued\nto account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter\nafterwards, and managed the business with such success, that she not\nonly brought up reputably a family of children, but, at the expiration\nof the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house, and\nestablish her son in it.\n\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch\nof education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them\nand their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing,\nby preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and\nenabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with\nestablish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and\ngo on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.\n\nAbout the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young\nPresbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice,\nand apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew\ntogether considerable numbers of different persuasion, who join'd in\nadmiring them.  Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers,\nhis sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but\ninculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious\nstile are called good works.  Those, however, of our congregation, who\nconsidered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his\ndoctrine, and were join'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him\nof heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became\nhis zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a party in\nhis favour, and we combated for him a while with some hopes of success.\nThere was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding\nthat, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my\npen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the\nGazette of April, 1735.  Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with\ncontroversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of\nvogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.\n\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.\nOne of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much\nadmired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a\npart of it.  On search he found that part quoted at length, in one of\nthe British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's. This detection\ngave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause,\nand occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod.  I stuck by\nhim, however, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons compos'd\nby others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was\nthe practice of our common teachers.  He afterward acknowledg'd to me\nthat none of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory\nwas such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one\nreading only.  On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better\nfortune, and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I\ncontinu'd many years my subscription for the support of its ministers.\n\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a\nmaster of the French as to be able to read the books with ease.  I then\nundertook the Italian.  An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd\noften to tempt me to play chess with him.  Finding this took up too\nmuch of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play\nany more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game\nshould have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to\nbe got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd\nwas to perform upon honour, before our next meeting.  As we play'd\npretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language.  I\nafterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish\nas to read their books also.\n\nI have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a\nLatin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that\nlanguage entirely.  But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the\nFrench, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpriz'd to find, on looking over\na Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than\nI had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study\nof it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had\ngreatly smooth'd my way.\n\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some\ninconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages.  We are told\nthat it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd\nthat, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are\nderiv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more\neasily to acquire the Latin.  It is true that, if you can clamber and\nget to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more\neasily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the\nlowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore\noffer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of\nour youth, whether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit\nthe same after spending some years without having made any great\nproficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that\ntheir time has been lost, it would not have been better to have begun\nwith the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after\nspending the same time, they should quit the study of languages and\nnever arrive at the Latin, they would, however, have acquired another\ntongue or two, that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them\nin common life.\n\nAfter ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my\ncircumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I\ncould not sooner well afford.  In returning, I call'd at Newport to see\nmy brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former\ndifferences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and\naffectionate.  He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me\nthat, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I\nwould take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to\nthe printing business.  This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few\nyears to school before I took him into the office.  His mother carried\non the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an\nassortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn\nout.  Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I\nhad depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.\n\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the\nsmall-pox, taken in the common way.  I long regretted bitterly, and\nstill regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation.  This I\nmention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the\nsupposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died\nunder it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either\nway, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\n\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such\nsatisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing\ntheir friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we\nhad settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve.  We had from the\nbeginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was\npretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of\nimproper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find\nit difficult to refuse.  I was one of those who were against any\naddition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal,\nthat every member separately should endeavor to form a subordinate\nclub, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without\ninforming them of the connection with the Junto.  The advantages\nproposed were, the improvement of so many more young citizens by the\nuse of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the general\nsentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto member\nmight propose what queries we should desire, and was to report to the\nJunto what pass'd in his separate club; the promotion of our particular\ninterests in business by more extensive recommendation, and the\nincrease of our influence in public affairs, and our power of doing\ngood by spreading thro' the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.\n\nThe project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club,\nbut they did not all succeed.  Five or six only were compleated, which\nwere called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc.\nThey were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of\namusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some\nconsiderable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on\nparticular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of\ntime as they happened.\n\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General\nAssembly.  The choice was made that year without opposition; but the\nyear following, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the\nmembers, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in\norder to favour some other candidate.  I was, however, chosen, which\nwas the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate\nservice as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up\nan interest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of\nprinting the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for\nthe public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.\n\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a\ngentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to\ngive him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed,\nafterwards happened.  I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by\npaying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this\nother method.  Having heard that he had in his library a certain very\nscarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of\nperusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending\nit to me for a few days.  He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in\nabout a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the\nfavour.  When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had\nnever done before), and with great civility; and he ever after\nmanifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became\ngreat friends, and our friendship continued to his death.  This is\nanother instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which\nsays, \"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do\nyou another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" And it shows how\nmuch more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return,\nand continue inimical proceedings.\n\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then\npostmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy\nat Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and\ninexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered\nit to me.  I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for,\ntho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that\nimprov'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the\nadvertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a\nconsiderable income.  My old competitor's newspaper declin'd\nproportionably, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal,\nwhile postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders.\nThus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and I\nmention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd in\nmanaging affairs for others, that they should always render accounts,\nand make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality.  The\ncharacter of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all\nrecommendations to new employments and increase of business.\n\nI began now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning,\nhowever, with small matters.  The city watch was one of the first\nthings that I conceiv'd to want regulation.  It was managed by the\nconstables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned a\nnumber of housekeepers to attend him for the night.  Those who chose\nnever to attend paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was\nsuppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more\nthan was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place\nof profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such\nragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not\nchoose to mix with.  Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and\nmost of the nights spent in tippling.  I thereupon wrote a paper, to be\nread in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more\nparticularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the\nconstables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a\npoor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch\ndid not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the\nwealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds worth of goods in his\nstores.\n\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of\nproper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more\nequitable way of supporting the charge the levying a tax that should be\nproportion'd to the property.  This idea, being approv'd by the Junto,\nwas communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them;\nand though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by\npreparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the\nlaw obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were\ngrown into more influence.\n\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was\nafterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by\nwhich houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means\nproposed of avoiding them.  This was much spoken of as a useful piece,\nand gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a\ncompany for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual\nassistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger.\nAssociates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty.\nOur articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good\norder, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with\nstrong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which\nwere to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month\nand spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating\nsuch ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires, as might be\nuseful in our conduct on such occasions.\n\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring\nto be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were\nadvised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on,\none new company being formed after another, till they became so\nnumerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of\nproperty; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty\nyears since its establishment, that which I first formed, called the\nUnion Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first\nmembers are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year\nthan I am.  The small fines that have been paid by members for absence\nat the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase of\nfire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each\ncompany, so that I question whether there is a city in the world better\nprovided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations;\nand, in fact, since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire\nmore than one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often been\nextinguished before the house in which they began has been half\nconsumed.\n\nIn 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield, who\nhad made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher.  He was at\nfirst permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy,\ntaking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was\noblig'd to preach in the fields.  The multitudes of all sects and\ndenominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was\nmatter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the\nextraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much\nthey admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of\nthem, by assuring them that they were naturally half beasts and half\ndevils.  It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of\nour inhabitants.  From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion,\nit seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could\nnot walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in\ndifferent families of every street.\n\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to\nits inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner\npropos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but\nsufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the\nbuilding, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the\nsize of Westminster Hall; and the work was carried on with such spirit\nas to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected.\nBoth house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of\nany preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say\nsomething to the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not\nbeing to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in\ngeneral; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a\nmissionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his\nservice.\n\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the\ncolonies to Georgia.  The settlement of that province had lately been\nbegun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,\naccustomed to labor, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was\nwith families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many\nof indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set\ndown in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure\nthe hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many\nhelpless children unprovided for.  The sight of their miserable\nsituation inspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea\nof building an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and\neducated.  Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made\nlarge collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the\nhearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.\n\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute\nof materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from\nPhiladelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to\nhave built the house here, and brought the children to it.  This I\nadvis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel,\nand I therefore refus'd to contribute.  I happened soon after to attend\none of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to\nfinish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing\nfrom me, I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four\nsilver dollars, and five pistoles in gold.  As he proceeded I began to\nsoften, and concluded to give the coppers.  Another stroke of his\noratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver;\nand he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the\ncollector's dish, gold and all.  At this sermon there was also one of\nour club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in\nGeorgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by\nprecaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home.  Towards the\nconclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give,\nand apply'd to a neighbour, who stood near him, to borrow some money\nfor the purpose.  The application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps\nthe only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by\nthe preacher.  His answer was, \"At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I\nwould lend to thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy\nright senses.\"\n\nSome of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would\napply these collections to his own private emolument; but I who was\nintimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons\nand Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity,\nbut am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct\na perfectly honest man, and methinks my testimony in his favour ought\nto have the more weight, as we had no religious connection.  He us'd,\nindeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the\nsatisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard.  Ours was a mere\ncivil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\n\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we\nstood.  Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me\nthat he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could\nlodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr.\nBenezet, was removed to Germantown.  My answer was, \"You know my house;\nif you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most\nheartily welcome.\" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for\nChrist's sake, I should not miss of a reward.  And I returned, \"Don't\nlet me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.\"\nOne of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to\nbe the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shift\nthe burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and place it\nin heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me\nabout his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to\nthe establishment of a college.\n\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences\nso perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great\ndistance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the\nmost exact silence.  He preach'd one evening from the top of the\nCourt-house steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the\nwest side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles.  Both\nstreets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance.  Being\namong the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how\nfar he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards\nthe river; and I found his voice distinct till I came near\nFront-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it.  Imagining\nthen a semi-circle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that\nit were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two square\nfeet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty\nthousand.  This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accounts of his having\npreach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the\nantient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had\nsometimes doubted.\n\nBy hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons\nnewly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of\nhis travels.  His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent\nrepetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of\nvoice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without\nbeing interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with\nthe discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from\nan excellent piece of musick.  This is an advantage itinerant preachers\nhave over those who are stationary, as the latter can not well improve\ntheir delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\n\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his\nenemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered\nin preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by\nsupposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have\nbeen deny'd; but litera scripta monet.  Critics attack'd his writings\nviolently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the\nnumber of his votaries and prevent their encrease; so that I am of\nopinion if he had never written any thing, he would have left behind\nhim a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might\nin that case have been still growing, even after his death, as there\nbeing nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a\nlower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for\nhim as great a variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration\nmight wish him to have possessed.\n\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances\ngrowing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as\nbeing for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring\nprovinces.  I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, \"that\nafter getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the\nsecond,\" money itself being of a prolific nature.\n\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to\nengage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved\nwell, by establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies,\non the same terms with that in Carolina.  Most of them did well, being\nenabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me\nand go on working for themselves, by which means several families were\nraised.  Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in\nthis, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think,\na good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our\narticles, every thing to be done by or expected from each partner, so\nthat there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore\nrecommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem\npartners may have for, and confidence in each other at the time of the\ncontract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of\ninequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., which are\nattended often with breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps\nwith lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.\n\nI had, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being\nestablished in Pennsylvania.  There were, however, two things that I\nregretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat\neducation of youth; no militia, nor any college.  I therefore, in 1743,\ndrew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time,\nthinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person\nto superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him;\nbut he, having more profitable views in the service of the\nproprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not\nknowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the\nscheme lie a while dormant.  I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in\nproposing and establishing a Philosophical Society.  The paper I wrote\nfor that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.\n\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against\nGreat Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us\ninto great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our\ngovernor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia\nlaw, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having\nproved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary\nassociation of the people.  To promote this, I first wrote and\npublished a pamphlet, entitled PLAIN TRUTH, in which I stated our\ndefenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and\ndiscipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an\nassociation, to be generally signed for that purpose.  The pamphlet had\na sudden and surprising effect.  I was call'd upon for the instrument\nof association, and having settled the draft of it with a few friends,\nI appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before\nmentioned.  The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of\nprinted copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room.\nI harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper, and explained\nit, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the\nleast objection being made.\n\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found\nabove twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the\ncountry, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand.\nThese all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed\nthemselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and\nmet every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts\nof military discipline.  The women, by subscriptions among themselves,\nprovided silk colors, which they presented to the companies, painted\nwith different devices and mottos, which I supplied.\n\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment,\nbeing met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I\ndeclin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and\nman of influence, who was accordingly appointed.  I then propos'd a\nlottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and\nfurnishing it with cannon.  It filled expeditiously, and the battery\nwas soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with\nearth.  We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being\nsufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time,\nour proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of\nobtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and\nmyself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow\nsome cannon of Governor Clinton.  He at first refus'd us peremptorily;\nbut at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of\nMadeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by\ndegrees, and said he would lend us six.  After a few more bumpers he\nadvanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded\neighteen.  They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their\ncarriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery, where\nthe associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among\nthe rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.\n\nMy activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and\ncouncil; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in\nevery measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the\nassociation.  Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the\nproclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of\nHeaven on our undertaking.  They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was\nthe first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no\nprecedent from which to draw the proclamation.  My education in New\nEngland, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some\nadvantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into\nGerman, printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province.\nThis gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of\ninfluencing their congregations to join in the association, and it\nwould probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had\nnot soon interven'd.\n\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these\naffairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the\nAssembly of the province, where they formed a great majority.  A young\ngentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to\nsucceed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to\ndisplace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will,\nadvis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being\nturn'd out.  My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some\npublic man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to\nrefuse one when offer'd to him.  \"I approve,\" says I, \"of his rule, and\nwill practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never\nrefuse, nor ever resign an office.  If they will have my office of\nclerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me.  I will\nnot, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making\nreprisals on my adversaries.\" I heard, however, no more of this; I was\nchosen again unanimously as usual at the next election.  Possibly, as\nthey dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who had\njoin'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations,\nwith which the House had long been harass'd, they might have been\npleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care to\ndisplace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and they\ncould not well give another reason.\n\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was\nnot disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to\nassist in it.  And I found that a much greater number of them than I\ncould have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the\ndefensive.  Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject,\nand some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe\nconvinc'd most of their younger people.\n\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their\nprevailing sentiments.  It had been propos'd that we should encourage\nthe scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then\nabout sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery.  By our rules, no money\ncould be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal.  The\ncompany consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers,\nand eight only of other persuasions.  We eight punctually attended the\nmeeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us,\nwe were by no means sure of a majority.  Only one Quaker, Mr. James\nMorris, appear'd to oppose the measure.  He expressed much sorrow that\nit had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and\nit would create such discord as might break up the company.  We told\nhim that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if\nFriends were against the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should,\nagreeably to the usage of all societies, submit.  When the hour for\nbusiness arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then\ndo it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members\nintended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but\ncandid to allow a little time for their appearing.\n\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen\nbelow desir'd to speak with me.  I went down, and found they were two\nof our Quaker members.  They told me there were eight of them assembled\nat a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us\nif there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case,\nand desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do\nwithout it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with\ntheir elders and friends.  Being thus secure of a majority, I went up,\nand after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another\nhour.  This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair.  Not one of his\nopposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and,\nat the expiration of the hour, we carry'd the resolution eight to one;\nand as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us,\nand thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd\nto oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers\nsincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all\nregular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and\nhad due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.\n\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect,\nwas one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of\ndefensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments.  He\nput into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for\nthe battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly\nto that service.  He told me the following anecdote of his old master,\nWilliam Penn, respecting defense.  He came over from England, when a\nyoung man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary.  It was\nwar-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be\nan enemy.  Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn\nand his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance,\nand they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James\nLogan, who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun.  The\nsuppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the\nsecretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn\nrebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist\nin defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends,\nespecially as it had not been required by the captain.  This reproof,\nbeing before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, \"I\nbeing thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down?  But thee\nwas willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when\nthee thought there was danger.\"\n\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were\nconstantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the\nembarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever\napplication was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for\nmilitary purposes.  They were unwilling to offend government, on the\none hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the\nQuakers, on the other, by a compliance contrary to their principles;\nhence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising\nthe compliance when it became unavoidable.  The common mode at last\nwas, to grant money under the phrase of its being \"for the king's use,\"\nand never to inquire how it was applied.\n\nBut, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was\nfound not so proper, and some other was to be invented.  As, when\npowder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and\nthe government of New England solicited a grant of some from\nPennsilvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas,\nthey could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an\ningredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three\nthousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, and\nappropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat, or other\ngrain.  Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further\nembarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not\nbeing the thing he had demanded; but be reply'd, \"I shall take the\nmoney, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is\ngunpowder,\" which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to\nit.[10]\n\n     [10] See the votes.--[Marg. note.]\n\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we\nfeared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had\nsaid to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, \"If we fail, let us\nmove the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have\nno objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a\ncommittee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly\na fire-engine.\" \"I see,\" says he, \"you have improv'd by being so long\nin the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their\nwheat or other grain.\"\n\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd\nand published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was\nlawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards,\nhowever they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of\nwhat I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of\nthe Dunkers.  I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael\nWelfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were\ngrievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd\nwith abominable principles and practices, to which they were utter\nstrangers.  I told him this had always been the case with new sects,\nand that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to\npublish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their\ndiscipline.  He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not\nagreed to, for this reason:  \"When we were first drawn together as a\nsociety,\" says he, \"it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as\nto see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors;\nand that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths.  From\ntime to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our\nprinciples have been improving, and our errors diminishing.  Now we are\nnot sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the\nperfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if\nwe should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves\nas if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive\nfarther improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving\nwhat we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred,\nnever to be departed from.\"\n\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of\nmankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth,\nand that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling\nin foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees\nwrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people\nin the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in\ntruth he is as much in the fog as any of them.  To avoid this kind of\nembarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining\nthe public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing\nrather to quit their power than their principle.\n\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742,\ninvented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the same\ntime saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I\nmade a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early\nfriends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the plates\nfor these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand.\nTo promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled \"An\nAccount of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their\nConstruction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their\nAdvantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and\nall Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered\nand obviated,\" etc.  This pamphlet had a good effect.  Gov'r. Thomas\nwas so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it,\nthat he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a\nterm of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever\nweighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great\nadvantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an\nopportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we\nshould do freely and generously.\n\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet,\nand working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the\nmachine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there,\nand made, as I was told, a little fortune by it.  And this is not the\nonly instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho'\nnot always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no\ndesire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes.  The use of\nthese fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring\ncolonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.\n\nPeace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an\nend, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an\nacademy.  The first step I took was to associate in the design a number\nof active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next\nwas to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the\nEducation of Youth in Pennsylvania.  This I distributed among the\nprincipal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their\nminds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a\nsubscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid\nin quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the\nsubscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no\nless, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.\n\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not\nas an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as\nmuch as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to\nthe publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.\n\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose\nout of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,\nthen attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the\ngovernment of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was\nhired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same\nyear, 1749.\n\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and\nwe were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with\nintention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house\nready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our\npurpose.  This was the building before mentioned, erected by the\nhearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following\nmanner.\n\nIt is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by\npeople of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of\ntrustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a\npredominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that\npredominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of\nsuch sect, contrary to the original intention.  It was therefore that\none of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one\nPresbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of\nvacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the\ncontributors.  The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, and\non his death they resolved to have no other of that sect.  The\ndifficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by\nmeans of the new choice.\n\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to.  At\nlength one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an\nhonest man, and of no sect at all, which prevail'd with them to chuse\nme.  The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long\nsince abated, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh\ncontributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other\ndebts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly.\nBeing now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building and\nthat for the Academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with\nboth, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees\nfor the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter\nundertaking to discharge the debt, to keep for ever open in the\nbuilding a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the\noriginal intention, and maintain a free school for the instruction of\npoor children.  Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the\ndebts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the\npremises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and\ndifferent rooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing\nsome additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose,\nand the scholars remov'd into the building.  The care and trouble of\nagreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the\nwork, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did\nnot then interfere with my private business, having the year before\ntaken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall,\nwith whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me\nfour years.  He took off my hands all care of the printing-office,\npaying me punctually my share of the profits.  This partnership\ncontinued eighteen years, successfully for us both.\n\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a\ncharter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions\nin Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the\nAssembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established\nthe present University of Philadelphia.  I have been continued one of\nits trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the\nvery great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd\ntheir education in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities,\nserviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country.\n\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I\nflatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had\nacquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for\nphilosophical studies and amusements.  I purchased all Dr. Spence's\napparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded\nin my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now\nconsidering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes,\nevery part of our civil government, and almost at the same time,\nimposing some duty upon me.  The governor put me into the commission of\nthe peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council,\nand soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a\nburgess to represent them in Assembly.  This latter station was the\nmore agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to\nhear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were\noften so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making\nmagic squares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and I\nconceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good.  I\nwould not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all\nthese promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning,\nthey were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as\nbeing so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and\nby me entirely unsolicited.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few\ncourts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more\nknowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in\nthat station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself\nby my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the\nAssembly.  My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten\nyears, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying,\neither directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen.  On taking\nmy seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\n\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at\nCarlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they\nshould nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members\nof council, as commissioners for that purpose.[11] The House named the\nspeaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to\nCarlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\n\n     [11] See the votes to have this more correctly.\n          --[Marg. note.]\n\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very\nquarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor\nto them; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them\nthat if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them\nplenty of rum when business was over.  They promis'd this, and they\nkept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty\nwas conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction.  They\nthen claim'd and receiv'd the rum; this was in the afternoon; they were\nnear one hundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary\ncabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town.  In the\nevening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out\nto see what was the matter.  We found they had made a great bonfire in\nthe middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women,\nquarreling and fighting.  Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen\nonly by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one\nanother with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a\nscene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be\nimagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our\nlodging.  At midnight a number of them came thundering at our door,\ndemanding more rum, of which we took no notice.\n\nThe next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that\ndisturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their\napology.  The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum;\nand then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying, \"The Great Spirit, who\nmade all things, made every thing for some use, and whatever use he\ndesign'd any thing for, that use it should always be put to.  Now, when\nhe made rum, he said 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,'\nand it must be so.\"  And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to\nextirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the\nearth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means.  It\nhas already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the\nsea-coast.\n\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the\nidea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent\ndesign, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the\nreception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the\nprovince or strangers.  He was zealous and active in endeavouring to\nprocure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in\nAmerica, and at first not well understood, he met with but small\nsuccess.\n\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no\nsuch thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my\nbeing concern'd in it.  \"For,\" says he, \"I am often ask'd by those to\nwhom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this\nbusiness?  And what does he think of it?  And when I tell them that I\nhave not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe,\nbut say they will consider of it.\" I enquired into the nature and\nprobable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very\nsatisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but\nengag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others.\nPreviously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the\nminds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which\nwas my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.\n\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but,\nbeginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some\nassistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for\nit, which was done.  The country members did not at first relish the\nproject; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city,\nand therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and\nthey doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it.\nMy allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to\nleave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by\nvoluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition,\nand utterly impossible.\n\nOn this I form'd my plan; and asking leave to bring in a bill for\nincorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their\npetition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was\nobtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the\nbill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important\nclause a conditional one, viz., \"And be it enacted, by the authority\naforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen\ntheir managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their\ncontributions a capital stock of ----- value (the yearly interest of\nwhich is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the\nsaid hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and\nmedicines), and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the\nspeaker of the Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may\nbe lawful for the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an\norder on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand\npounds, in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital,\nto be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.\"\n\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had\noppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of\nbeing charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then,\nin soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional\npromise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's\ndonation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways.  The\nsubscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we\nclaim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the\ndesign into execution.  A convenient and handsome building was soon\nerected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful,\nand flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political\nmanoeuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or\nwherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having\nmade some use of cunning.\n\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert\nTennent, came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring\na subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the\nuse of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were\noriginally disciples of Mr. Whitefield.  Unwilling to make myself\ndisagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their\ncontributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish\nhim with a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be\ngenerous and public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me,\nafter their kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to\nbe worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a\nlist.  He then desir'd I would at least give him my advice.  \"That I\nwill readily do,\" said I; \"and, in the first place, I advise you to\napply to all those whom you know will give something; next, to those\nwhom you are uncertain whether they will give any thing or not, and\nshow them the list of those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect\nthose who you are sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may\nbe mistaken.\" He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my\nadvice.  He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtained a much\nlarger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capacious and\nvery elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.\n\nOur city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large,\nstrait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of\nsuffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the\nwheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was\ndifficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive.  I\nhad liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the\ninhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions.  A strip\nof ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with\nbrick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but\nwere often over shoes in dirt to get there.  By talking and writing on\nthe subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd\nwith stone between the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was\non each side next the houses.  This, for some time, gave an easy access\nto the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd,\nwhenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook\noff and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which\nwas not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.\n\nAfter some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to\nundertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week,\ncarrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the\nsum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house.  I then wrote and\nprinted a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that\nmight be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping\nour houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet;\nthe benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could\nmore easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust\nblown in upon their goods, etc., etc.  I sent one of these papers to\neach house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe\nan agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for\na time well executed.  All the inhabitants of the city were delighted\nwith the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it\nbeing a convenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have\nall the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a\ntax for that purpose.\n\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into\nthe Assembly.  It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did\nnot pass till I was gone.[12] and then with an alteration in the mode\nof assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an\nadditional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which\nwas a great improvement.  It was by a private person, the late Mr. John\nClifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at\nhis door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea of\nenlighting all the city.  The honour of this public benefit has also\nbeen ascrib'd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman.  I did but\nfollow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the\nform of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first\nsupply'd with from London.  Those we found inconvenient in these\nrespects:  they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not\nreadily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its\ninside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford;\ngiving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an\naccidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it\ntotally useless.  I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat\npanes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices\nadmitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this\nmeans they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as\nthe London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and an\naccidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily\nrepair'd.\n\n     [12] See votes.\n\nI have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect\nholes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall have in keeping\nthem clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps.  But, these\nholes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more\nsuddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the\nother use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and\ntherefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of\nLondon are very poorly illuminated.\n\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd,\nwhen in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have\nknown, and a great promoter of useful projects.  I had observ'd that\nthe streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried\naway; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to\nmud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there\nwas no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it\nwas with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open\nabove, the sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at every jolt on\nthe pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of\nfoot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets\nwas, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.\n\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be\ndone in a little time.  I found at my door in Craven-street, one\nmorning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she\nappeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness.\nI ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am\nvery poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and\nhopes they will give me something.\"  I bid her sweep the whole street\nclean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12\nshe came for the shilling.  From the slowness I saw at first in her\nworking, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and\nsent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was\nswept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was\nin the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the\npavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.\n\nI then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in\nthree hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time.\nAnd here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such\na narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each\nside, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street\nruns from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current\nstrong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided\ninto two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only\nmakes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and\nfeet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is\nthereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those\nwho are walking.  My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as\nfollows:\n\n\"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of\nLondon and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be\ncontracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud\nrak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his\nround; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments\nfor these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to\nfurnish the poor people they may employ in the service.\n\n\"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at\nproper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually\nopened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry\nit all away.\n\n\"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad\nagain by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the\nscavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon\nwheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being\ncover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit\nthe water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water\nmaking the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be\nplac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in\nwheel-barrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and\nthen horses brought to draw them away.\"\n\nI have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of\nthis proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the\ndifficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much\nthe passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the\ndust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very\npracticable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking\nthro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I\nobserv'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the\nsun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily\nto live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often\ncomplain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price\nof tallow.\n\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating;\nbut when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single\nperson, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small\nimportance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city,\nand its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps\nthey will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to\naffairs of this seemingly low nature.  Human felicity is produc'd not\nso much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by\nlittle advantages that occur every day.  Thus, if you teach a poor\nyoung man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may\ncontribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a\nthousand guineas.  The money may be soon spent, the regret only\nremaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he\nescapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their\nsometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves\nwhen most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being\ndone with a good instrument.  With these sentiments I have hazarded the\nfew preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or\nother may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it\nvery happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.\n\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America\nas his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the\nofficers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly\nwith Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the\npostmaster-general in England.  The American office never had hitherto\npaid any thing to that of Britain.  We were to have six hundred pounds\na year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the\noffice.  To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of\nthese were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four\nyears the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us.  But\nit soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak\nof the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it\nto yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the\npostoffice of Ireland.  Since that imprudent transaction, they have\nreceiv'd from it--not one farthing!\n\nThe business of the postoffice occasion'd my taking a journey this year\nto New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion,\npresented me with the degree of Master of Arts.  Yale College, in\nConnecticut, had before made me a similar compliment.  Thus, without\nstudying in any college, I came to partake of their honours.  They were\nconferr'd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the\nelectric branch of natural philosophy.\n\nIn 1754, war with France being again apprehended, a congress of\ncommissioners from the different colonies was, by an order of the Lords\nof Trade, to be assembled at Albany, there to confer with the chiefs of\nthe Six Nations concerning the means of defending both their country\nand ours.  Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted\nthe House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for\nthe Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr.\nNorris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as\ncommissioners to act for Pennsylvania.  The House approv'd the\nnomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did\nnot much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other\ncommissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\n\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all\nthe colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for\ndefense, and other important general purposes.  As we pass'd thro' New\nYork, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr.\nKennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being\nfortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the\nCongress.  It then appeared that several of the commissioners had\nform'd plans of the same kind.  A previous question was first taken,\nwhether a union should be established, which pass'd in the affirmative\nunanimously.  A committee was then appointed, one member from each\ncolony, to consider the several plans and report.  Mine happen'd to be\npreferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.\n\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a\npresident-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand\ncouncil was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the\nseveral colonies, met in their respective assemblies.  The debates upon\nit in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business.\nMany objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were\nall overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies\nordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies\nof the several provinces.  Its fate was singular:  the assemblies did\nnot adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it,\nand in England it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.\n\nThe Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it\nfor the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd,\nsupposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of\nthe provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to\nmeet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to\ndraw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was\nafterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on\nAmerica.  My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found\namong my political papers that are printed.\n\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with\nGovernor Shirley upon both the plans.  Part of what passed between us\non the occasion may also be seen among those papers.  The different and\ncontrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was\nreally the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been\nhappy for both sides the water if it had been adopted.  The colonies,\nso united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended\nthemselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England;\nof course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody\ncontest it occasioned, would have been avoided.  But such mistakes are\nnot new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.\n\n          Look round the habitable world, how few\n          Know their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!\n\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally\nlike to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new\nprojects.  The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from\nprevious wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly,\nexpress'd his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn\nup with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore\nrecommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious\nattention.\"  The House, however, by the management of a certain member,\ntook it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair,\nand reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no\nsmall mortification.\n\nIn my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new\ngovernor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had\nbeen before intimately acquainted.  He brought a commission to\nsupersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary\ninstructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I\nthought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration.  I said,\n\"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will\nonly take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.\"  \"My\ndear friend,\" says he, pleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding\ndisputes?  You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest\npleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I\npromise you I will, if possible, avoid them.\"  He had some reason for\nloving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore,\ngenerally successful in argumentative conversation.  He had been\nbrought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming\nhis children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while\nsitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise;\nfor, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting,\nand confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs.  They\nget victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of\nmore use to them.  We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.\n\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by\nwhich it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the\nHouse were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle\nbetween them as long as he retain'd the government.  I had my share of\nit; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on\nevery committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the\ncommittees always desired to make the drafts.  Our answers, as well as\nhis messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and,\nas he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when\nwe met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so\ngood-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me was\noccasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together.\n\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the\nstreet.  \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the\nevening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me\nby the arm, he led me to his house.  In gay conversation over our wine,\nafter supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of\nSancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government,\nrequested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not\nagree with his people, he might sell them.  One of his friends, who sat\nnext to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these\ndamn'd Quakers?  Had not you better sell them?  The proprietor would\ngive you a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked\nthem enough.\" He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in\nall his messages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as he laid it\non, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding\nhe was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton,\ngrew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.\n\n[13]These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the\nproprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to\nbe incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness\ninstructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary\ntaxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly\nexcused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe\nsuch instructions.  The Assemblies for three years held out against\nthis injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last.  At length Captain\nDenny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those\ninstructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.\n\n     [13] My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.--[Marg. note.]\n\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story:  there are still some\ntransactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of\nGovernor Morris.\n\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of\nMassachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point, and sent Mr.\nQuincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to\nNew York, to solicit assistance.  As I was in the Assembly, knew its\ntemper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my\ninfluence and assistance.  I dictated his address to them, which was\nwell receiv'd. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out\nin provisions.  But the governor refusing his assent to their bill\n(which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown),\nunless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from\nbearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho'\nvery desirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a\nloss how to accomplish it.  Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor\nto obtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\n\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor,\nby orders on the trustees of the Loan Office, which, by law, the\nAssembly had the right of drawing.  There was, indeed, little or no\nmoney at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the\norders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per\ncent.  With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be\npurchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the\nproposal.  The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the\ncommittee directed to sign and dispose of them.  The fund for paying\nthem was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the\nprovince upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise,\nwhich being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant\ncredit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but\nmany money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those\norders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon\nhand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were\neagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen.\nThus this important affair was by my means compleated.  My Quincy\nreturn'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home\nhighly pleas'd with the success of his embassy, and ever after bore for\nme the most cordial and affectionate friendship.\n\nThe British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies\nas propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest\nthey should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength,\nsuspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent\nover General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for\nthat purpose.  He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd\nto Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages.  Our\nAssembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived\nviolent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to\nwait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the\nguise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most\ncelerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of\nthe several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual\ncorrespondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense.  My son\naccompanied me on this journey.\n\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the\nreturn of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and\nVirginia to collect waggons.  I stayed with him several days, din'd\nwith him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his\nprejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his\narrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his\noperations.  When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be\nobtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted only\nto twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition.\nThe general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the\nexpedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against\nthe ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the\nmeans of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one\nhundred and fifty waggons being necessary.\n\nI happened to say I thought it was a pity they had not been landed\nrather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his\nwaggon.  The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, \"Then\nyou, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them\nfor us; and I beg you will undertake it.\"  I ask'd what terms were to\nbe offer'd the owners of the waggons; and I was desir'd to put on paper\nthe terms that appeared to me necessary.  This I did, and they were\nagreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd\nimmediately.  What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I\npublish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the\ngreat and sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall\ninsert it at length, as follows:\n\n               \"ADVERTISEMENT.\n                        \"LANCASTER, April 26, 1755.\n\n\"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each\nwaggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the\nservice of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's\nCreek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to\nempower me to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice\nthat I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next\nWednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday\nevening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or\nsingle horses, on the following terms, viz.: I. That there shall be\npaid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen\nshillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or\nother saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able\nhorse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem.  2.  That the pay\ncommence from the time of their joining the forces at Will's Creek,\nwhich must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that a\nreasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for\ntheir travelling to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge.\n3.  Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be\nvalued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in\ncase of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service,\nthe price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid.  4.\nSeven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner\nof each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if\nrequired, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the\npaymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to\ntime, as it shall be demanded.  5.  No drivers of waggons, or persons\ntaking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon\nto do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting\nor taking care of their carriages or horses.  6.  All oats, Indian\ncorn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp, more\nthan is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for\nthe use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.\n\n\"Note.--My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like\ncontracts with any person in Cumberland county.\n\n                                        \"B. FRANKLIN.\"\n\n     \"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster,\n                    York and Cumberland.\n\n\"Friends and Countrymen,\n\n\"Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found\nthe general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not\nbeing supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from\nthis province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the\ndissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been\nprovided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\n\n\"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these\ncounties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should\nbe wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be\nnecessary to drive and take care of them.\n\n\"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these\ncounties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they\nare in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many\nand great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more\nwillingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair\nand equitable means.  The people of these back counties have lately\ncomplained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you\nhave an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very\nconsiderable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should\ncontinue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and\ntwenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward\nof thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of\nthe king's money.\n\n\"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march\nabove twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they\ncarry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the\narmy, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's\nsake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march\nor in a camp.\n\n\"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to\nhis majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy\nto yourselves; for three or four of such as can not separately spare\nfrom the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a\ndriver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or\ntwo horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately\nbetween you; but if you do not this service to your king and country\nvoluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to\nyou, your loyalty will be strongly suspected.  The king's business must\nbe done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not\nstand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably\nexpected from you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures\nwill probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense\nwhere you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or\nregarded.\n\n\"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the\nsatisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only my labour for\nmy pains.  If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not\nlikely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen\ndays; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of\nsoldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I\nshall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your\nfriend and well-wisher, B. FRANKLIN.\"\n\n\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed\nin advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but, that sum being\ninsufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two\nweeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and\nfifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp.  The\nadvertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any\nwaggon or horse should be lost.  The owners, however, alleging they did\nnot know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his\npromise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly\ngave them.\n\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of\nColonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the\nsubalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could\nill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be\nnecessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to\nbe purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor\nprocuring them some relief.  I said nothing, however, to him of my\nintention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly,\nwho had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the\ncase of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a\npresent should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments.  My son,\nwho had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a\nlist for me, which I enclos'd in my letter.  The committee approv'd,\nand used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived\nat the camp as soon as the waggons.  They consisted of twenty parcels,\neach containing\n\n  6 lbs. loaf sugar.                1 Gloucester cheese.\n  6 lbs. good Muscovado do.         1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good\n  1 lb. good green tea.             butter.\n  1 lb. good bohea do.              2 doz. old Madeira wine.\n  6 lbs. good ground coffee.        2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\n  6 lbs. chocolate.                 1 bottle flour of mustard.\n  1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.      2 well-cur'd hams.\n  1-2 lb. pepper.                   1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.\n  1 quart best white wine vinegar   6 lbs. rice.\n                                    6 lbs. raisins.\n\nThese twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each\nparcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer.\nThey were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by\nletters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful\nterms.  The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in\nprocuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of\ndisbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther\nassistance in sending provisions after him.  I undertook this also, and\nwas busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for\nthe service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling,\nof which I sent him an account.  It came to his hands, luckily for me,\na few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order\non the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the\nremainder to the next account.  I consider this payment as good luck,\nhaving never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more\nhereafter.\n\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a\nfigure as a good officer in some European war.  But he had too much\nself-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops,\nand too mean a one of both Americans and Indians.  George Croghan, our\nIndian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those\npeople, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts,\netc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected\nthem, and they gradually left him.\n\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his\nintended progress.  \"After taking Fort Duquesne,\" says he, \"I am to\nproceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac, if the season\nwill allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain\nme above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct\nmy march to Niagara.\"  Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line\nhis army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for\nthem thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former\ndefeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I\nhad conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign.\nBut I ventur'd only to say, \"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before\nDuquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that\nplace not yet compleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong\ngarrison, can probably make but a short resistance.  The only danger I\napprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians,\nwho, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them;\nand the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make,\nmay expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut\nlike a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, can not\ncome up in time to support each other.\"\n\nHe smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, \"These savages may, indeed, be\na formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's\nregular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make\nany impression.\"  I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing\nwith a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more.\nThe enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I\napprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance\nwithout interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then,\nwhen more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front\nhad halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the\nwoods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy\nfire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the\ngeneral had of an enemy's being near him.  This guard being disordered,\nthe general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done\nin great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently\nthe fire came upon their flank:  the officers, being on horseback, were\nmore easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and\nthe soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no\norders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed;\nand then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.\n\nThe waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their\nexample was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons,\nprovisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy.  The general,\nbeing wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr.\nShirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers,\nsixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men\nkilled out of eleven hundred.  These eleven hundred had been picked men\nfrom the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar,\nwho was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and\nbaggage.  The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and\nthe panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his\npeople; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who\nhad beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and\nFrench together, instead of proceeding, and endeavoring to recover some\nof the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be\ndestroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards\nthe settlements, and less lumber to remove.  He was there met with\nrequests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania,\nthat he would post his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some\nprotection to the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro'\nall the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'd at\nPhiladelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him.  This whole\ntransaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted\nideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.\n\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the\nsettlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally\nruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining\nthe people if they remonstrated.  This was enough to put us out of\nconceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any.  How different\nwas the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march\nthro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to\nVirginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest\ncomplaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\n\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being\ngrievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to\nhis death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally\nsilent all the first day, and at night only said, \"Who would have\nthought it?\"  That he was silent again the following day, saying only\nat last, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time;\" and\ndy'd in a few minutes after.\n\nThe secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions,\nand correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and\ntranslated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to\nprove the hostile intentions of the British court before the\ndeclaration of war.  Among these I saw some letters of the general to\nthe ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the\narmy, and recommending me to their notice.  David Hume, too, who was\nsome years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France,\nand afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he\nhad seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly\nrecommending me.  But, the expedition having been unfortunate, my\nservice, it seems, was not thought of much value, for those\nrecommendations were never of any use to me.\n\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would\ngive orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought\nservants, and that he would discharge such as had been already\nenlisted.  This he readily granted, and several were accordingly\nreturn'd to their masters, on my application.  Dunbar, when the command\ndevolv'd on him, was not so generous.  He being at Philadelphia, on his\nretreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the\nservants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had\nenlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head.  He\npromised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he\nshould be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there\ndeliver their men to them.  They accordingly were at the expense and\ntrouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform his\npromise, to their great loss and disappointment.\n\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all\nthe owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to\npay.  Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting\nthem that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders\nfor paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley, and my\nassuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he\nbeing at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they\nmust have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some\nbegan to sue me.  General Shirley at length relieved me from this\nterrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims,\nand ordering payment.  They amounted to near twenty thousand pound,\nwhich to pay would have ruined me.\n\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me\nwith a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a\ngrand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on\nreceipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne.  I looked grave, and\nsaid it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing\nwhen we knew we should have occasion to rejoice.  They seem'd surpris'd\nthat I did not immediately comply with their proposal.  \"Why the d--l!\"\nsays one of them, \"you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be\ntaken?\" \"I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the\nevents of war are subject to great uncertainty.\"  I gave them the\nreasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors\nthereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the\nfirework had been prepared.  Dr. Bond, on some other occasion\nafterward, said that he did not like Franklin's forebodings.\n\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message\nafter message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the\nmaking of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without\ntaxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all\ntheir bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his\nattacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being\ngreater.  The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had\njustice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential\nright if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one\nof the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his\npropos'd amendment was only of a single word.  The bill expressed \"that\nall estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the\nproprietaries not excepted.\"  His amendment was, for not read only:  a\nsmall, but very material alteration.  However, when the news of this\ndisaster reached England, our friends there, whom we had taken care to\nfurnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages,\nrais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and\ninjustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going so far\nas to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province, they\nforfeited their right to it.  They were intimidated by this, and sent\norders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their\nmoney to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.\n\nThis, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share\nof a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause,\nwhich passed accordingly.  By this act I was appointed one of the\ncommissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds.  I had\nbeen active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had,\nat the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining of a\nvoluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much\ndifficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their\nliberty.  To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I\nwrote a dialogue,[14] stating and answering all the objections I could\nthink of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought,\ngreat effect.\n\n     [14] This dialogue and the militia act are in the\n          \"Gentleman's Magazine\" for February and March, 1756.\n           --[Marg. note.]\n\nWhile the several companies in the city and country were forming and\nlearning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge\nof our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and\nprovide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and\nbuilding a line of forts.  I undertook this military business, tho' I\ndid not conceive myself well qualified for it.  He gave me a commission\nwith full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be\ngiven to whom I thought fit.  I had but little difficulty in raising\nmen, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command.  My son, who\nhad in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against\nCanada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me.  The Indians had\nburned Gnadenhut, a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the\ninhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the\nforts.\n\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the\nchief establishment of those people.  I was surprised to find it in so\ngood a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them\napprehend danger.  The principal buildings were defended by a stockade;\nthey had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and\nhad even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows\nof their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the\nheads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them.  The armed\nbrethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any\ngarrison town.  In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I\nmention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of\nParliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had\nsuppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms.  He\nanswer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but\nthat, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a\nprinciple with many of their people.  On this occasion, however, they,\nto their surprise, found it adopted by but a few.  It seems they were\neither deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but common\nsense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for\nwhimsical opinions.\n\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of\nbuilding forts.  I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with\ninstructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the\ncountry, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and\nI concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where\na fort was tho't more immediately necessary.  The Moravians procur'd me\nfive waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\n\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from\ntheir plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of\nfirearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle.  I gave\nthem each a gun with suitable ammunition.  We had not march'd many\nmiles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there\nwere no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near\nnight at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all\nhuddled together, as wet as water could make us.  It was well we were\nnot attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort,\nand our men could not keep their gun locks dry.  The Indians are\ndextrous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not.  They met\nthat day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten of\nthem.  The one who escap'd inform'd that his and his companions' guns\nwould not go off, the priming being wet with the rain.\n\nThe next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the\ndesolated Gnadenhut.  There was a saw-mill near, round which were left\nseveral piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an\noperation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no\ntents.  Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found\nthere, who had been half interr'd by the country people.\n\nThe next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference\nmeasuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many\npalisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter\neach.  Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work\nto cut down trees, and, our men being dextrous in the use of them,\ngreat despatch was made.  Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the\ncuriosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in\nsix minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen\ninches diameter.  Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long,\npointed at one end.  While these were preparing, our other men dug a\ntrench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be\nplanted; and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and\nhind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts\nof the perch, we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the\npalisades from the woods to the spot.  When they were set up, our\ncarpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet\nhigh, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes.  We had\none swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as\nsoon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing,\nthat we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name\nmay be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though\nit rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.\n\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are\nbest content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and\ncheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work,\nthey spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous\nand quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in\ncontinual ill-humor, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule\nit was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told\nhim that they had done every thing, and there was nothing further to\nemploy them about, \"Oh,\" says he, \"Make them scour the anchor.\"\n\nThis kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense\nagainst Indians, who have no cannon.  Finding ourselves now posted\nsecurely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out\nin parties to scour the adjacent country.  We met with no Indians, but\nwe found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to\nwatch our proceedings.  There was an art in their contrivance of those\nplaces, that seems worth mention.  It being winter, a fire was\nnecessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground\nwould by its light have discovered their position at a distance.  They\nhad therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and\nsomewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the\ncharcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods.  With these\ncoals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we\nobserv'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by\ntheir laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to\nkeep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point.  This\nkind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by its light,\nflame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number was not\ngreat, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them\nwith prospect of advantage.\n\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty,\nwho complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers\nand exhortations.  When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay\nand provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to\nthem, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I\nobserv'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I\nsaid to Mr. Beatty, \"It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your\nprofession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out\nand only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.\" He\nliked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few\nhands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never\nwere prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I\nthought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some\nmilitary laws for non-attendance on divine service.\n\nI had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with\nprovisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me\nthat he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the\nposture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there\nwas no longer necessary.  My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me\nby their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three\nintended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to\nremain on their farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the\nmore willingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced\nin Indian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to\naccept the command.  I gave him a commission, and, parading the\ngarrison, had it read before them, and introduc'd him to them as an\nofficer who, from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to\ncommand them than myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took\nmy leave.  I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few\ndays to recover from the fatigue I had undergone.  The first night,\nbeing in a good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my\nhard lodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket\nor two.\n\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the\nMoravians:  some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to\nme.  I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at common tables, and\nslept in common dormitories, great numbers together.  In the\ndormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just\nunder the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of\nair.  I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick,\nthe organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets,\netc.  I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to\nmixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common\npractice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other\ntimes their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little\nchildren, each division by itself.  The sermon I heard was to the\nlatter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under\nthe conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a\nyoung woman.  The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities,\nand was deliver'd in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it\nwere, to be good.  They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale and\nunhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors,\nor not allow'd sufficient exercise.\n\nI inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was\ntrue that they were by lot.  I was told that lots were us'd only in\nparticular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself\ndispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted\nthe elder ladies that govern'd the young women.  As these elders of the\ndifferent sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions\nof their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were\nsuitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for\nexample, it should happen that two or three young women were found to\nbe equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to.  I\nobjected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the\nparties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy.  \"And so they\nmay,\" answer'd my informer, \"if you let the parties chuse for\nthemselves;\" which, indeed, I could not deny.\n\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on\nswimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty\ngenerally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose\ntheir captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law.\nDr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to\nspread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those\nendeavors.  I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue;\nhowever, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy\nhis opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases.\nThe officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I\nthis time accepted.  I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded\nabout twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who\nhad been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become\nso expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute.  The first\ntime I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would\nsalute me with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and\nbroke several glasses of my electrical apparatus.  And my new honour\nproved not much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after\nbroken by a repeal of the law in England.\n\nDuring this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a\njourney to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their\nheads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far\nas the Lower Ferry.  Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my\ndoor, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms.  I\nhad not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have\nprevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any\noccasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I\ncould not avoid their accompanying me.  What made it worse was, that,\nas soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them\nnaked all the way.  Somebody wrote an account of this to the\nproprietor, and it gave him great offense.  No such honor had been paid\nhim when in the province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it\nwas only proper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for\naught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such\ncases.\n\nThis silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me,\nwhich was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly\nrespecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had\nalways oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his\nmeanness and injustice of contending for it.  He accused me to the\nministry as being the great obstacle to the king's service, preventing,\nby my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising\nmoney, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my\nhaving an intention to take the government of the province out of his\nhands by force.  He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the\npostmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other\neffect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.\n\nNotwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the\nHouse, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still\nsubsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and we\nnever had any personal difference.  I have sometimes since thought that\nhis little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I\ndrew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional habit, and\nthat, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as merely\nadvocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries\nand I for the Assembly.  He would, therefore, sometimes call in a\nfriendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho'\nnot often, take my advice.\n\nWe acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and,\nwhen the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in\nhaste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the\ndesertion of the back counties.  I forget now the advice I gave; but I\nthink it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if\npossible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection,\ntill, by re-enforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed\non the expedition.  And, after my return from the frontier, he would\nhave had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial\ntroops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being\notherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general.  I had\nnot so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess'd to\nhave, and I believe his professions must have exceeded his real\nsentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity would\nfacilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the\ngrant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the\nproprietary estate.  Finding me not so forward to engage as he\nexpected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government,\nbeing superseded by Captain Denny.\n\nBefore I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under\nthis new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give\nsome account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.\n\nIn 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately\narrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments.  They\nwere imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a\nsubject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me.  Soon\nafter my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr.\nP. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, a present of a\nglass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such\nexperiments.  I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had\nseen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquir'd great readiness in\nperforming those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding\na number of new ones.  I say much practice, for my house was\ncontinually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new\nwonders.\n\nTo divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number\nof similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they\nfurnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers.\nAmong these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbor,\nwho, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the\nexperiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the\nexperiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such\nexplanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in\ncomprehending the following.  He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the\npurpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for\nmyself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well\nattended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went\nthro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd\nup some money.  In the West India islands, indeed, it was with\ndifficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of\nthe air.\n\nOblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc.,\nI thought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it,\nand wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments.\nHe got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first\nthought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions.\nOne paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of\nlightning with electricity, I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of\nmine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me word\nthat it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs.  The\npapers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too\nmuch value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them.  Mr.\nCollinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentleman's\nMagazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr.\nFothergill wrote the preface.  Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his\nprofit, for by the additions that arrived afterward they swell'd to a\nquarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for\ncopy-money.\n\nIt was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice\nof in England.  A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the\nCount de Buffon, a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in\nFrance, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard to\ntranslate them into French, and they were printed at Paris.  The\npublication offended the Abbe Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy\nto the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd and\npublish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue.\nHe could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and\nsaid it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his\nsystem.  Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existed such\na person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote\nand published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me, defending\nhis theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of the\npositions deduc'd from them.\n\nI once purpos'd answering the abbe, and actually began the answer; but,\non consideration that my writings contain'd a description of\nexperiments which any one might repeat and verify, and if not to be\nverifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'd as\nconjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me\nunder any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute\nbetween two persons, writing in different languages, might be\nlengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of one\nanother's meaning, much of one of the abbe's letters being founded on\nan error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for\nthemselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare\nfrom public business in making new experiments, than in disputing about\nthose already made.  I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the\nevent gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy,\nof the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my\nbook was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and\nthe doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adopted by the\nphilosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abbe; so that he\nlived to see himself the last of his sect, except Monsieur B----, of\nParis, his eleve and immediate disciple.\n\nWhat gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the\nsuccess of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs.  Dalibard\nand De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds.  This\nengag'd the public attention every where.  M. de Lor, who had an\napparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of\nscience, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia\nExperiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court,\nall the curious of Paris flocked to see them.  I will not swell this\nnarrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the\ninfinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I made\nsoon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the\nhistories of electricity.\n\nDr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who\nwas of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments\nwere in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings\nhad been so little noticed in England.  The society, on this, resum'd\nthe consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the\ncelebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I\nhad afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied\nwith some praise of the writer.  This summary was then printed in their\nTransactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly\nthe very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of\nprocuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting\nthem with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the\nslight with which they had before treated me.  Without my having made\nany application for that honor, they chose me a member, and voted that\nI should be excus'd the customary payments, which would have amounted\nto twenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions\ngratis.  They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey\nCopley for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a\nvery handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was\nhighly honoured.\n\nOur new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the\nbefore-mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me\nat an entertainment given him by the city.  He accompanied it with very\npolite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long\nacquainted with my character.  After dinner, when the company, as was\ncustomary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me aside into\nanother room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by his friends\nin England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of\ngiving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the\nmaking his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things\nto have a good understanding with me, and he begg'd me to be assur'd of\nhis readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be\nin his power.  He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good\ndisposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to\nus all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so\nlong continu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd between\nhim and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be\nmore serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate\nacknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc.  The drinkers, finding we\ndid not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira,\nwhich the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more\nprofuse of his solicitations and promises.\n\nMy answers were to this purpose:  that my circumstances, thanks to God,\nwere such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that,\nbeing a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any;\nthat, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that,\nwhenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the\ngood of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more\nzealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this,\nthat the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve\nthe proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people;\nthat I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of\nregard to me, and that he might rely on every thing in my power to make\nhis administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he\nhad not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his\npredecessor had been hamper'd with.\n\nOn this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to\ndo business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputes were\nrenewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the\npenman, first, of the request to have a communication of the\ninstructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in\nthe votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward\npublish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often\ntogether; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was\nvery entertaining and pleasing in conversation.  He gave me the first\ninformation that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was\nesteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been\nemploy'd in the dispute between Prince Frederic and the king, and had\nobtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was\nindeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad;\nbut his prose was thought as good as any man's.\n\n[15]The Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted\nin manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only\nwith the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown,\nresolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their\nagent to go over to England, to present and support the petition.  The\nHouse had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty\nthousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which was\nsubjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the\ngovernor absolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with his\ninstructions.\n\n     [15] The many unanimous resolves of the Assembly--\n          what date?--[Marg. note.]\n\nI had agreed with Captain Morris, of the paquet at New York, for my\npassage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at\nPhiladelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavor an accommodation\nbetween the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not\nbe obstructed by their dissensions.  Accordingly, he desir'd the\ngovernor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said\non both sides.  We met and discuss'd the business.  In behalf of the\nAssembly, I urg'd all the various arguments that may be found in the\npublic papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed\nwith the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his\ninstructions; the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if he\ndisobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun\nwould advise it.  This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once\nthought I had nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather\nchose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to\nuse my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he would\nspare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers, and\nthat, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves,\nthey must remain expos'd to the enemy.\n\nI acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them with\na set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we\ndid not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the\nexercise of them on this occasion thro' force, against which we\nprotested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another\nconformable to the proprietary instructions.  This of course the\ngovernor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage.\nBut, in the meantime, the paquet had sailed with my sea-stores, which\nwas some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks\nfor my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling\nto his share.\n\nHe set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the\npaquet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining\nthere, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to\nknow the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine.\nHis answer was, \"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next;\nbut I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday\nmorning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer.\"  By some\naccidental hinderance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived,\nand I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but\nI was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the\nharbor, and would not move till the next day.  One would imagine that I\nwas now on the very point of departing for Europe.  I thought so; but I\nwas not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which\nindecision was one of the strongest features.  I shall give some\ninstances.  It was about the beginning of April that I came to New\nYork, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail'd. There\nwere then two of the paquet-boats, which had been long in port, but\nwere detained for the general's letters, which were always to be ready\nto-morrow. Another paquet arriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we\nsail'd, a fourth was expected.  Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as\nhaving been there longest.  Passengers were engag'd in all, and some\nextremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their\nletters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war\ntime) for fall goods! but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's\nletters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always\nat his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly.\n\nGoing myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber\none Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence\nexpress with a paquet from Governor Denny for the General.  He\ndelivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my\ninquiring when he was to return, and where be lodg'd, that I might send\nsome letters by him.  He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at\nnine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off\nimmediately.  I put my letters into his hands the same day.  A\nfortnight after I met him again in the same place.  \"So, you are soon\nreturn'd, Innis?\"  \"Returned! no, I am not gone yet.\" \"How so?\"  \"I\nhave called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his\nlordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.\" \"Is it possible, when he\nis so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire.\"\n\"Yes,\" says Innis, \"but he is like St. George on the signs, always on\nhorseback, and never rides on!\" This observation of the messenger was,\nit seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr.\nPitt gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending\nGenerals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and\ncould not know what he was doing.\n\nThis daily expectation of sailing, and all the three paquets going down\nto Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best\nto be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they\nbe left behind.  There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks,\nconsuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more.  At length the\nfleet sail'd, the General and all his army on board, bound to\nLouisburg, with intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the\npaquet-boats in company ordered to attend the General's ship, ready to\nreceive his dispatches when they should be ready.  We were out five\ndays before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship\nquitted the fleet and steered for England.  The other two paquets he\nstill detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some\ntime to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then alter'd\nhis mind as to besieging Louisburg, and return'd to New York, with all\nhis troops, together with the two paquets above mentioned, and all\ntheir passengers!  During his absence the French and savages had taken\nFort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had\nmassacred many of the garrison after capitulation.\n\nI saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those\npaquets.  He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, he\nacquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that\nmust necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a\npaquet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and\nclean her bottom.  He was asked how long time that would require.  He\nanswer'd, three days.  The general replied, \"If you can do it in one\nday, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day\nafter to-morrow.\" So he never obtain'd leave, though detained\nafterwards from day to day during full three months.\n\nI saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'd\nagainst his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New\nYork, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he\nwould sue for damages.  Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as\nhe represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.\n\nOn the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted with\nso important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having\nsince seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and\nmotives for giving places, my wonder is diminished.  General Shirley,\non whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock,\nwould, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better\ncampaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive,\nand disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was\nnot a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and\nattentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious\nplans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution.  Loudoun,\ninstead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them\ntotally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort\nGeorge was lost, besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations,\nand distress'd our trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of\nprovisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the\nenemy, but in reality for beating down their price in favor of the\ncontractors, in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion\nonly, he had a share.  And, when at length the embargo was taken off,\nby neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet\nwas detain'd near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so\nmuch damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their\npassage home.\n\nShirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so\nburdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man\nunacquainted with military business.  I was at the entertainment given\nby the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the\ncommand.  Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also.  There\nwas a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some\nchairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among\nthem very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley.  Perceiving it as\nI sat by him, I said, \"They have given you, sir, too low a seat.\" \"No\nmatter,\" says he, \"Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.\"\n\nWhile I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd all\nthe accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd to Braddock,\nsome of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from the different\npersons I had employ'd to assist in the business.  I presented them to\nLord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the ballance.  He caus'd them to be\nregularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every\narticle with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance\ndue for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the\npaymaster.  This was, however, put off from time to time; and, tho' I\ncall'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it.  At length, just\nbefore my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration,\nconcluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors.  \"And\nyou,\" says he, \"when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at\nthe treasury, and you will be paid immediately.\"\n\nI mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had\nbeen put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason for my\ndesiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not\nright I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the\nmoney I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, \"O,\nsir,\" says he, \"you must not think of persuading us that you are no\ngainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one\nconcerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill\nhis own pockets.\"  I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I had\nnot pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me;\nand, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made\nin such employments.  As to my ballance, I am not paid it to this day,\nof which more hereafter.\n\nOur captain of the paquet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the\nswiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved\nthe dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification.  After\nmany conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship\nalmost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain\nordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as\npossible.  We were, passengers included, about forty persons.  While we\nstood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far\nbehind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was\nloaded too much by the head.  The casks of water, it seems, had been\nall plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft,\non which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the sailer in the\nfleet.\n\nThe captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which\nis accounted thirteen miles per hour.  We had on board, as a passenger,\nCaptain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and\nthat no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some\nerror in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the\nlog.  A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there\nshould be sufficient wind.  Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the\nlog-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the\nlog himself.  Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair\nand fresh, and the captain of the paquet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd\nshe then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the\nexperiment, and own'd his wager lost.\n\nThe above fact I give for the sake of the following observation.  It\nhas been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that\nit can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or\nwill not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship\nhas been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the\ncontrary, remarkably dull.  I apprehend that this may partly be\noccasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of\nlading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the\nsame vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall\nsail better or worse than when by the orders of another.  Besides, it\nscarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and\nsail'd by the same person.  One man builds the hull, another rigs her,\na third lades and sails her.  No one of these has the advantage of\nknowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore, can\nnot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.\n\nEven in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often\nobserv'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the\nsuccessive watches, the wind being the same.  One would have the sails\ntrimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no\ncertain rule to govern by.  Yet I think a set of experiments might be\ninstituted, first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for\nswift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the\nmasts:  then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the\nwind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading.  This is an\nage of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd\nwould be of great use.  I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some\ningenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.\n\nWe were several times chas'd in our passage, but outsail'd every thing,\nand in thirty days had soundings.  We had a good observation, and the\ncaptain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a\ngood run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the\nmorning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the\nenemy's privateers, who often crus'd near the entrance of the channel.\nAccordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the\nwind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great\nway.  The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he\nthought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is\nsometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which\ndeceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's\nsquadron.  This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.\n\nWe had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, \"Look\nwell out before there,\" and he as often answered, \"Ay ay;\" but perhaps\nhad his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes\nanswering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just\nbefore us, which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the\nhelm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the\nship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near\nit, the light appearing to me as big as a cart-wheel. It was midnight,\nand our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck,\nand seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails\nstanding; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear,\nand we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on\nwhich the light-house was erected.  This deliverance impressed me\nstrongly with the utility of light-houses, and made me resolve to\nencourage the building more of them in America, if I should live to\nreturn there.\n\nIn the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near\nour port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight.  About nine\no'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the\nwater like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the\ntown of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that\nsurrounded it.  This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had\nbeen so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a\nvacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from\nthe anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.\n\nI set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a\nlittle by the way to view Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and Lord\nPembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at\nWilton.  We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.[16]\n\n     [16] Here terminates the Autobiography, as published by\n          Wm. Temple Franklin and his successors.  What follows\n          was written in the last year of Dr. Franklin's life,\n          and was first printed (in English) in Mr. Bigelow's\n          edition of 1868.--ED.\n\nAS SOON as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me,\nI went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and\nwhose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain.  He\nwas against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the\nproprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly\nbe induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends,\nto accommodate matters amicably.  I then waited on my old friend and\ncorrespondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the\ngreat Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should\narrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's, who was then\nPresident of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible.  I\nagreed to go with him the next morning.  Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called\nfor me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me\nwith great civility; and after some questions respecting the present\nstate of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me:\n\"You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you\ncontend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and\nthink yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own\ndiscretion.  But those instructions are not like the pocket\ninstructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his\nconduct in some trifling point of ceremony.  They are first drawn up by\njudges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and\nperhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king.\nThey are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for\nthe king is the LEGISLATOR OF THE COLONIES.\"  I told his lordship this\nwas new doctrine to me.  I had always understood from our charters that\nour laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to\nthe king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could\nnot repeal or alter them.  And as the Assemblies could not make\npermanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for\nthem without theirs.  He assur'd me I was totally mistaken.  I did not\nthink so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little\nalarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning\nus, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings.  I\nrecollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into\nParliament by the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions\nlaws in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for\nwhich we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by\ntheir conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that\npoint of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for\nthemselves.\n\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries,\nthey agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring\nGarden.  The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of\ndisposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had\nits own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable.  We then went into\nconsideration of our several points of complaint, which I enumerated.\nThe proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I\nthe Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other\nin our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement.  However, it\nwas concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in\nwriting, and they promis'd then to consider them.  I did so soon after,\nbut they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand\nJohn Paris, who managed for them all their law business in their great\nsuit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore,\nwhich had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and\nmessages in their dispute with the Assembly.  He was a proud, angry\nman, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated\nhis papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of\nargument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to\nme, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the\nproprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss the heads of\ncomplaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating with any one but\nthem.  They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the\nAttorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it,\nwhere it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during which time I\nmade frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without\nobtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of\nthe Attorney and Solicitor-General.  What it was when they did receive\nit I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a\nlong message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my\npaper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part,\nand giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they\nshould be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out\nsome person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating\nthereby that I was not such.\n\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having\naddress'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of True and\nAbsolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I omitted\nas not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was\nonly to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had\ndelivered viva voce.\n\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny\nto pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates\nof the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted\nanswering the message.\n\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by\nParis, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent.\nAccordingly they petition'd the king in Council, and a hearing was\nappointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act,\nand two by me in support of it.  They alledg'd that the act was\nintended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the\npeople, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the\nproprietaries who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in\nproportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined.  We reply'd\nthat the act had no such intention, and would have no such effect.\nThat the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess\nfairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect\nin lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was\ntoo trifling to induce them to perjure themselves.  This is the purport\nof what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted\nstrongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for\nthat the money, L100,000, being printed and given to the king's use,\nexpended in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal\nwould strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total\ndiscouragement of future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors\nin soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear\nof their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the\nstrongest terms.  On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel rose, and\nbeckoning me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were\npleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would\nbe done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act.  I said\ncertainly.  \"Then,\" says he, \"you can have little objection to enter\ninto an engagement to assure that point.\"  I answer'd, \"None at all.\"\nHe then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's\nproposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was\ndrawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles,\nwho was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs, when\nLord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law\nwas allowed to pass.  Some changes were however recommended and we also\nengaged they should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did\nnot think them necessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the\nact before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to\nexamine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they\nput several particular friends of the proprietaries.  After a full\nenquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had\nbeen assess'd with perfect equity.\n\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the\nengagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured\nthe credit of the paper money then spread over all the country.  They\ngave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries\nwere enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd\nhim out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he\nhad given bond to observe.  He, however, having done it at the instance\nof the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having some powerful\ninterest at court, despis'd the threats and they were never put in\nexecution.  . . . [Unfinished].\n\n\nCHIEF EVENTS IN FRANKLIN'S LIFE\n\nEnding, as it does, with the year 1757, the autobiography leaves\nimportant facts un-recorded.
