Both Men and Beasts have _some-thing_ or another, for\nwhich they are esteem'd; so ye being in a particular manner Happy in\nthis _Talent_, may securely laugh, while ye daily _grow_ in the Ladies\nFavour, and spread your _Branches_ over all the Kingdom: Many a hopeful\n_Stick of Wood_ has been produc'd by this glorious Tree, who after they\nhad _piss'd_ their Estates against the Wall (as the good Housewives term\nit) have by the Strength of true _Hibernian_ Prowess rais'd themselves\nto the Favour of some fair Virtuoso, and being by her _plac'd in a\nHOT-BED_, have been restor'd to their pristine Strength, and flourish'd\nagain; and like true Heroes, not envying the busy World, have been\ncontent to _spend_ the remainder of their Days in an obscure Nook of the\nWorld.\n\nThus, Gentlemen, and as all Poets chuse the most Worthy to patronize\ntheir Works, I humbly offer ye the following Poem, and that you may\nstill continue as ye now are; that your Trees may ever flourish, your\n_Green-houses_ be secure, nor your _young Plants_ be ever nipt in the\n_Bud_, and that you may ever _stand_ against all _Cracks_, Storms,\nTempests, and _Eruptions_,\n\n_Is the hearty Wishes of Your's_,\n\nBOTANICUS.\n\n\n\n\nTHE Natural HISTORY OF THE TREE of LIFE.\n\n\n  The Tree of which I fain would sing,\n  If the kind Muse her Aid would bring,\n  Is _Arbor Vitae_; but in brief,\n  By vulgar Men call'd--_Tree of Life_.\n\n  First for Description then, 'tis such\n  As needs must captivate you much.\n  In Stem most streight, of lovely Size,\n  With Head elate this Plant doth rise;\n  First bare--when it doth further shoot,\n  _A Tuft of Moss_ keeps warm the Root:\n  No _Lapland_ Muff has such a Fur,\n  No Skin so soft has any Cur;\n  This touch'd, alone the Heart can move,\n  Which Ladies more than Lap-dogs love;\n  From this erect springs up the Stalk,\n  No Power can stop, or ought can baulk;\n  On Top an _Apex_ crowns the Tree,\n  As all Mankind may plainly see;\n  So shines a Filbeard, when the Shell,\n  Half gone, displays the _ruby Peel_\n  Or like a Cherry bright and gay,\n  Just red'ning in the Month of _May_.\n\n  As other Trees bear Fruit at Top,\n  And they who rob 'em must _climb up_;\n  This still more rare doth upward shoot,\n  But at the Bottom bears its Fruit,\n  And they who'd reap its Virtues strong,\n  Need but to lay 'em _all along_,\n  _Ope' wide, their Mouths_, and they'll receive\n  The _Fruit of Life_, and eat, and live:\n  Not the fair Tree that _India_ bears,\n  All over Spice both Head and Ears,\n  Can boast more Gifts than the Great Pow'rs\n  Have granted to this Tree of ours:\n  That in good Ale its Power boasts,\n  And ours has _Nutmeg's_ fit for _Toasts_\n  And Bags by _Nature_ planted grow,\n  To keep 'em from all Winds that blow.\n\n  The Rise is slow, and by Degrees,\n  Both Fruits and Tree itself increase\n  So slow, that ten Years scarce produce\n  _Six Inches_ good and fit for Use;\n  But fifteen ripen well the Fruit,\n  And add a _viscous Balm_ into't;\n  Then rub'd, drops Tears as if 'twas greiv'd,\n  Which by a neighbouring Shrub's receiv'd;\n  As Men set Tubs to catch the Rain,\n  So does this Shrub _its Juice_ retain,\n  Which 'cause it wears a colour'd Robe,\n  Is justly call'd the _flow'ring Shrub_.\n\n  In every Nation springs this Tree,\n  In some confin'd; in others more free;\n  In _England_, 'tis of mod'rate Size,\n  And oft' does _nine full inches_ rise:\n  But _Ireland_, tho' in Soil most poor,\n  Exceeds all Lands in this fame Store;\n  And sent o'er hither, it is such\n  As does exceed our own by much,\n  And gets the Owner many a _Farthing_,\n  For _Ladies_ love it in their _Garden_.\n\n  That it's a _Tree_ right _sensitive_,\n  Denies no honest Man alive:\n  Tho' as one _shrinks_ and will not stand,\n  This _rises_ at a _Lady's_ Hand,\n  And grows more strong the more 'tis strok'd,\n  As others _fall_ when they are _pok'd_.\n\n  When nipping Cold bites off our Nose,\n  And hoary Frosts the Morn disclose,\n  In _Hot-beds_ only then 'twill live,\n  And only when-well warm'd will thrive;\n  But when warm Summer does appear,\n  'Twill _stand_ all _brunts_ in open Air;\n  Tho' oft they're overcome with Heat,\n  And sink with Nurture too replete;\n  Then _Birchen Twigs_, if right apply'd\n  To Back, Fore-part, or either Side----\n  Support a while, _and keep it up_,\n  Tho' soon again the Plant will droop.\n\n  _Motteux_ had one very untow'rd,\n  And thought to mend it with a Cord,\n  But _kill'd the Tree_, yet gain'd his _End_,\n  Which makes th' Experiment condemn'd.\n\n  Others have thought to mend the Root,\n  By taking from the Tree its Fruit;\n  But in the _Nutmegs_ lies the Breed,\n  And when they're gone we lose the _Seed_;\n  Tho' Virtuosi still have don't,\n  And always found it yield Accompt;\n  For _Hey----gg----r_ then buys the _Wood_,\n  And of it makes us Whistles good,\n  Which yearly from _Italia_ sent,\n  Here answers his and our Intent.\n\n  Others too curious will _innoc_\n  _Ulate_ their Plants on _Medlars_ Stock,\n  (_i.e._ as Tongues in Vulgar pass,\n  They graft it on an _Open-arse_;)\n  But Gardeners, Virtuosi, all,\n  Say this is most _unnatural_.\n\n  That Soil is certainly the best,\n  Whence first it sprang, and first increast,\n  In Vallies hollow, soft, and warm,\n  With Hills to ward off every Storm,\n  Where Water salt runs trickling down,\n  And _Tendrils_ lie o'er all the Ground,\n  Such as the Tree itself shoots forth,\n  And better if't be tow'rds the _North_;\n  When such a Piece of Ground you see,\n  If in the midst a Pit there be,\n  There plant it deep unto the _Root_,\n  And never fear----you'll soon have _Fruit_.\n\n  Tho' let young _Botanists_ beware\n  Of Insects that oft' harbour there,\n  Which 'mongst the tender _Fibres_ breed,\n  And if not kill'd, eat up the _Seed_:\n  Good _Humphrey Bowen_ gives another,\n  (As each Man should assist his Brother)\n  That is, to take especial Care\n  Not to set _Vulvaria_ near;\n  Of them two Sorts are frequent found,\n  One helps, and to'ther spoils the Ground;\n  And many a Plant thriving and tall,\n  Destroy'd by them, has got a Fall.\n\n  But _Misan_'s taken this just napping,\n  And _against all Things that can happen_\n  Both to the Shrub and Tree, has told some\n  How to make the deadliest _Wholesome_;\n  These venomous _Vulvaria_ grow\n  At _Vaux-Hall_ and _St. James's_ too;\n  Nay, and about the Tree so leap,\n  That very few good Plants can 'scape.\n\n\n_The Names and Virtues_\n\n\n  Old Mother _D'Acier_, in her Notes\n  _On Homer_, some hard _Greek_ Word quotes,\n  Calls it _Nep, nep_,--I know not what,\n  And says it is the very Plant that\n  The tawny Queen to _Helen_ sent,\n  To cure her Griefs at all Event.\n\n  Great _Milton's Murd'rer_ says it is\n  The fam'd _Machaera Herculis_,\n  And proves from some old _Grecian_ Poet,\n  So plain that all Men sure must know it,\n  That of this _Tree_ the Club was made,\n  With which he overcame ('tis said)\n  _Thespius_' Daughters, all grown wild,\n  And _fifty Mad-Women_ made _mild_;\n  Which very Club--(it makes one Laugh)\n  _Omphale_ turn'd into a Distaff.\n  Nay, the _Hesperian_ Tree was this,\n  As shew the _Poma Veneris_;\n  These Apples doubtless were the Fruit\n  That 'twixt the Queens rais'd such Dispute,\n  To make 'em all _stark-naked_ stand,\n  While _Paris_ held it in his Hand,\n  And _chuck'd_ it into _Venus_' Mouth,\n  'Cause she with Beauty fir'd the Youth.\n\n  The Virtues are of such great Note,\n  That twenty Volumes might be wrote;\n  The Juice alone Green-Sickness cures,\n  And purges thro' all corporal Pores;\n  If any Maid be sick, or faint\n  Of Love, or Father's close Constraint,\n  One Spoonfull of this Cordial Balm\n  Soon stops each Grief, and every Qualm;\n  'Tis true, they sometimes Tumours cause,\n  And in the Belly make strange Flaws,\n  But a few Moons will make 'em sound,\n  And safely fetch the Swelling down.\n\n  Not Saffron chears the Heart like this,\n  Nor can Champaign give such a Bliss:\n  When Wife and Husband do fall out,\n  And both remain in sullen pout,\n  This brings them to themselves again,\n  And fast unites the broken Chain;\n  Makes Feuds and Discords straightway cease\n  And gives at least a _Night of Peace_.\n\n  This Rarity may now be seen\n  In _Lambeth_, at a Garden Green,\n  _Bowen_ his Name, who in high Tone,\n  Calls it the _Tree of Silver Spoon_,\n  Which all the Maids of curious Eyes\n  May there behold of _largest_ Size.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE Natural HISTORY OF THE TREE of LIFE.\n\n_The_ DESCRIPTION _and_ PLACE.\n\n\nThe _Tree of Life_ is a _succulent Plant_, consisting of one only strait\nstem, on the top of which is a _Pistillum_ or _Apex_, at some times\n_Glandiform_ and resembling a _May-Cherry_, tho' at others, more like\nthe _Nut_ of the _Avellana_ or _Filbeard-Tree_.\n\nIts fruits, contrary to most others, grow near the Root; they are\nusually no more than two in number, their bigness somewhat exceeding\nthat of an ordinary _Nutmeg_ both contained in one strong _Siliqua_, or\npurse; which, together with the whole root of the plant, is commonly\nthick set with numerous _Fibrilla_ or _capillary Tendrils_.\n\nThe tree is of slow growth, and requires time to bring it to perfection,\nrarely seeding to any purpose before the fifteenth year; when the fruits\ncoming to good maturity, yield a viscous Juice or balmy _succus_, which\nbeing from time to time discharged at the _Pistillum_ is mostly bestow'd\nupon the open _Calyx's_ of the _Frutex Vulvaria_ or _flow'ring Shrub_\nusually spreading under the shade of this tree, and whose parts are by a\nwonderful mechanism adapted to receive it. The ingenious Mr. _Richard\nBradley_ is of opinion, the _Frutex_ is hereby impregnated, and then\nfirst begins to bear; he therefore accounts this _Succus_ the _Farina\nfoecundans_ of the plant: and the learned _Leonhard Fucksius_, in his\n_Historia Stirpium insigniorum_, observes the greatest sympathy between\nthis tree and shrub, _They are_, says he, _of the same genus, and do\nbest in the same bed, the_ Vulvaria _itself being indeed no other than\na_ female Arbor Vitae.\n\nIt is produced in most Countries, tho' it thrives more in some than\nothers, where it also increases to a larger size. The height here in\n_England_ rarely passes nine, or at the most, eleven inches, and that\nchiefly in _Kent_, whereas in _Ireland_, it comes to far greater\ndimensions, is so good, that many of the natives entirely subsist upon\nit, and when transplanted, have been sometimes known to raise good\nhouses with single plants of this sort.\n\nAs the _Irish_ soil is accounted the best, others are as remarkably bad\nfor its cultivation; and the least and worst in the world are said to be\nabout _Harborough_ and the _Forest of Sherard_.\n\nThe stem seems to be of the _sensitive_ tribe, tho' herein differing\nfrom the more common _Sensitives_; that whereas they are known to shrink\nand retire from even the gentlest touch of a Lady's hand, this rises on\nthe contrary, and extends itself when it is so handled.\n\nIn winter it is not easy to raise these trees without a hot bed; but in\nwarmer weather they stand well in the open air.\n\nIn the latter season they are subject to become weak and flaccid,\nand want support; for which purpose some gardeners have thought of\nsplintering them up with _birchen Twigs_, which has seem'd of some\nservice for the present, tho' the plants have very soon come to the\nsame or a more drooping state than before.\n\nThe late ingenious Mr. _Motteux_ thought of restoring a fine plant he\nhad in this condition, by tying it up with a _Tomex_ or cord made of the\nbark of the _Vitex_, or _Hempen-Tree_: but whether he made the ligature\ntoo straight, or that the nature of the _Vitex_ is really in itself\npernicious, he quite kill'd his plant thereby; which makes this\nuniversally condemn'd, as a dangerous experiment.\n\nSome _Virtuosi_ have thought of improving their trees for some purposes,\nby taking off the _Nutmegs_, which is however a bad way; they never\n_seed_ after, and are good for little more than making whistles of,\nwhich are imported every year from _Italy_, and sell indeed at a good\nprice.\n\nSome other curious Gentlemen have endeavour'd to inoculate their plants\non the stock of the _Medlar_ and that with a manure of _human Ordure_,\nbut this has never been approv'd; and I have known some tree brought to\na _very ill end_ by such management.\n\nThe natural soil is certainly the best for their propagation; and that\nis in hollow places, that are warm and near salt water, best known by\ntheir producing the same sort of _Tendrils_ as are observ'd about the\nroots of the _Arbor_ itself. Some cautions however are very necessary,\nespecially to young _Botanists_; and first, to be very diligent in\nkeeping their trees clean and neat; a pernicious sort of insect, not,\nunlike a _Morpione_ or _Cimex_, being very subject to breed amongst the\n_Fibrillae_, which, if not taken heed of, and timely destroy'd, proves\noften of very dangerous consequence.\n\nAnother caution, no less useful, we have from that excellent and\njudicious Botanist Mr. _Humphrey Bowen_, to beware of a poisonous\nspecies of _Vulvaria_, too often mistaken for the wholesome one, and\nwhich, if suffer'd too near our trees, will very greatly endanger their\nwell-being. He tells us, in the 12th volume of his large abridgment of\n_la Quintinye_, that before he had acquir'd his judgment and experience,\nsome of his plants have often been sufferers through this mistake; and\nhe has seen a tall thriving tree, by the contact: only of this venomous\nshrub, become _porrose, scabiose_, and cover'd with _fungous\nExcrescences_ not unlike the fruits of the _Ficus sylvestris_ in which\ncase the _succus_ also has lost both its colour and vertue; and the tree\nitself has so much partaken of the nature of the venomous shrub that had\nhurt it, that itself has become venomous, and spread the poison through\na whole Plantation.\n\nThese distempers of a tree of the greatest use and value, have employ'd\nthe labours of the most eminent Botanists and Gardeners, to seek out\nremedies for them: In which, however, none have succeeded like the\ncelebrated _Dr. Misaubin_ who from his profound knowledge in Botany has\ncomposed a most elaborate work upon _all the things that can happen_,\nboth to the _Arbor Vitae_ and _Vulvaria also_: There he has taught a\ncertain cure for all these evils; and, what is most wonderful, has even\nfound out a way of making the most venomous _Vulvaria_ itself wholesome,\nwhich he practises daily, to the satisfaction of all that apply to him.\n\nThese venomous _Vulvaria_ are but too common in most gardens about\n_London_; there are many in St. _James's Park_, and more in the\ncelebrated gardens at _Vaux-hall_ over the water.\n\n\n_The_ NAMES _and_ VIRTUES.\n\nBesides the common name of _Arbor Vitae_, a very learned Philosopher\nand great Divine would have it call'd, _Arbor Scientiae boni & mali_;\nbelieving, upon very good grounds, this is the tree which grew in the\nmiddle of the garden of _Eden_, and whose fruits were so alluring to\nour first mother. Others would have it call'd the _Mandrake_ of _Leah_,\npersuaded it is the same whose juice made the before barren _Rachel_\na joyful mother of children.\n\nThe learned _Madame D'Acier_ in her notes upon _Homer_ contends it\nshould be called _Nepenthes_. She gives many reasons why it certainly\nis that very plant, whose fruits the _Egyptian_ queen recommended to\n_Helen_, as a certain cure for pain and grief of all sorts, and which\nShe ever after kept by her as her most precious jewel, and made use of\nas a _Panacaea_ upon all occasions.\n\nThe great Dr. _Bentley_ calls it more than once _Machaera Herculis_,\nhaving proved out of the fragments of a _Greek_ Poet, that of this tree\nwas made that club with which the hero is said to have overcome the\nfifty wild daughters of _Thespius_, but which Queen _Omphale_ afterwards\nreduced to a distaff. Others have thought the celebrated _Hesperian_\ntrees were of this sort; and the very name of _Poma Veneris_, frequently\ngiven by Authors to the fruits of this tree, is a sufficient proof these\nwere really the _Apples_ for which three Goddesses contended in so warm\na manner, and to which the Queen of beauty had undoubtedly the strongest\ntitle.\n\nThe vertues are so many, a large volume might be wrote of them. The\njuice taken inwardly cures the green-sickness and other infirmities of\nthe like sort, and is a true specific in most disorders of the fair sex.\nIt indeed often causes tumours in the umbilical region; but even those\nbeing really of no ill consequence, disperse of themselves in a few\nMonths.\n\nIt chears the heart, and exhilarates the mind, quiets jars, feuds and\ndiscontents, making the most churlish tempers surprizingly kind and\nloving. Nor have private persons only been the better for this\nreconciling vertue, but whole states and kingdoms, nay, the greatest\nempires in the world have often received the benefit of it; the most\ndestructive wars have been ended, and the most friendly treaties been\nproduced, by a right application of this universal medicine among the\nchief of the contending parties.\n\nIf any person is desirous to see this excellent and wonderful plant in\ngood perfection, he may meet with it at the aforementioned Mr _Bowen's_\ngarden at _Lambeth_, who calls it _The Silver-Spoon Tree_; and is at all\ntimes ready to oblige his friends with the sight of it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE Ridotto al' Fresco, A POEM.\n\n\n  What various Arts attempts the am'rous Swain,\n  To force the Fair, or her Consent to gain--\n  Now _Balls_, now _Masquerades_ his Care employ,\n  And _Play_ and Park alternately give Joy--\n  Industrious _H----gg----r_, whose magick Brains\n  Still in their Shell the _Recipe_ retains\n  Like some good Midwife brings the Plot to light\n  And helps the lab'ring Swain to _Celia's_ Sight;\n  For this his Eunuchs in high Buskins tread--\n  And chaunt harmonious Lays for this,--and _Bread_;\n  For this the _Assembly's_ fix'd; and the huge Dome\n  Swells with the Lady's Vows, _when the Stake's gone_.--\n  For this he forms the vicious Masquerade,\n  Where Damsels may securely drive their Trade,\n  For which the Salesman, Chandler, Chairmen loudly pray,\n  And Pickpockets too, _hail_ the joyful Day--\n\n  But now what Tongue can praise the mighty Worth,\n  Who to _Ridotto_ gave an _English_ Birth;\n  To him let every Templar bend the Knee,\n  Receive a Ticket, and give up the Fee:\n  Let _Drury-Lane_ eternal Columns raise,\n  And every wanton Wife resound his Praise;\n  Let Courtiers with implicit Faith obey,\n  And to their grand Procurer Homage pay.\n\n  No more shall _Duchesses_ to _Bath_ repair,\n  Or fly to _Tunbridge_ to procure an Heir;\n  _Spring-Gardens_ can supply their every Want,\n  For here whate'er they ask the Swain wil grant,\n  And future Lords (if they'll confess the right)\n  Shall owe their Being to this blessed Night;\n  Hence future Wickedness shall take its Rise,\n  (For Masquerade to this is paultry Vice)\n  An Aera of new Crimes shall hence begin,\n  And _H----gg----r_ chief Devil be of Sin;\n  No more shall Ugliness be his Disgrace,\n  His Head mends all the Frailties of his Face;\n  When Masques and Balls to their Conclusion drew,\n  To this his last Resort the Hero flew;\n  So by degrees the Errant Knights of old\n  To Glory rose, and by Degrees grew bold;\n  A while content the common Road they trod,\n  'Till some great Act at last confess the _God_.\n\n  Now Painters _work_,--and dine, that starv'd before,\n  And Tallymen supply each needy Whore--\n  Fam'd _Covent-Garden_ droops with mournful Look,\n  Nor can St. _James's_ her great Rival brook:\n  Each _Duck_ and D----ss, quacks to different Tunes,\n  One _claps her Wings_ for Love, the other swoons;\n  Each _Vintner_ storms and swears he is undone,\n  Vollies of Oaths speak loud the Drawer's Moan;\n  _Porter_ who us'd to search for needful Girls,\n  Now sucks his Fingers, or his Apron twirls,\n  Bemoans his Loss of Business, and with Sighs,\n  In Box imprison'd lays the useless Dice.\n\n  _Spring-Garden_ now alone does all invite\n  The Cit, the Wit, the Rake, the Fool, the Knight:\n  No Lady, that can pawn her Coat or Gown,\n  Will rest 'till she has laid the Money down:\n  Each Clerk will to the Joints his Fingers work,\n  And Counsellors find out some modern Querk,\n  To raise the Guinea, and to see the _Grot_,\n  And 'mongst the _Belles_ to slant it at _Ridolt_.\n\n  Here Seamstresses and Maids together vie,\n  And the spruce 'Prentice shines in Sword and Tye:\n  Bandy'd in Lace the City Dame appears,\n  Her Hair genteelly frizzled round her Ears;\n  Her Gown with _Tyrian_ Dyes most richly stain'd,\n  Glitt'ring with Orient Pearl from Orphans gain'd.\n\n  _My Lord_, to oblige his Spouse, takes Tickets three,\n  Crys, one's for you my Love, and one for me,\n  The third dispose as you shall best adjudge,\n  Shew where you're pleas'd, and where you owe a Grudge:\n  _Madam_ elate, thinks she'll be kind to _Betty_,\n  To hide the Slips she made with Spark i'th' City:\n  But _Stallion Tom_, who well knew how to scold,\n  And by his Mistress's Favour grown too bold,\n  Swears if _he_ has it not, he will reveal,\n  And to his Master tell a dismal Tale;\n  _Madam_, reluctant, gives him up the Paper;\n  He at her Folly laughs, and cuts a Caper.\n\n  _Sylvia_, a Lady, kept by twenty Beaux,\n  Who never yet could brook the Marriage Noose,\n  By each a Ticket offer'd, scorns 'em all,\n  In hopes some Fool at last will Victim fall,\n  And, kindly offer Treat and Ticket too,\n  Which to her Charms she thinks most justly due;\n  At last a brisk young _Templar_ full of Fire,\n  Whom Writs with _Money_, Wine with Love inspire,\n  Address'd the Dame, she yeilds his glowing Charms,\n  And for a Ticket flies into his Arms:\n\n  So every _dapper Fop_ and _brawny Rake_\n  Will Tickets to their Ladies Presents make;\n  To Sin, the only certain Dedication,\n  To every gentle Mistress in the Nation,\n  From Suburb Whore, to ranting Dame of Fashion;\n  For none's so niece as to refuse the Suit,\n  But grasps the Tree tho' 'tis _forbidden Fruit_.\n\n  _Near_ where _the Thames_ in pleasant Windings runs,\n  _Near_ where the famous Glass-house fiercely burns,\n  (Which to the Love of poor desponding Swains,\n  An Emblem terrible, but just retains.)\n  _Near_ where fam'd _Vaux_ was to have fled,\n  _With_ lighted Match, soon as he'd done the Deed;\n  Whence some pretend to say by second Sight,\n  That it foreshew'd the Fate attends this Night,\n  'Cause here the Fair will many _Matches light_.\n\n  _Spring-Gardens_ lie shaded with verdant Trees,\n  That nod their reverend Heads at every Breeze;\n  Embassadors like _Turks_ hence send Express,\n  And _Ministers of State_ like Devils dress--\n\n  Should some wild _Indian_ see the various Scene,\n  He'd swear all Nations of the Earth do here convene,\n  And take for quite reverse this medley Farce,\n  Think Strumpers Saints, or catstick'd Beau a _Mars_.\n\n  But now the Dancers nimble Feet go round,\n  And with just Measures beat the passive Ground,\n  Each one inclines to different Delights--\n  Musick the Fair, Sweetmeats the Beau invite;\n  The _Templar_ wisely does his Care enroll,\n  Pockets the Pheasant, and eats up the Fowls\n  Nor will return to join the giddy Rout,\n  'Till he has eat and drank his _Guinea_ out.\n\n  Now Dancing fires the Nymph to softer Joys;\n  The Musick's dull, the Wine and Sweetmeat cloys;\n  _Strephon_ streight takes the Hint, withdraws a-while,\n  By soft Endearments does her Grief beguile;\n  Soon they return more vig'rous than before,\n  Do what they will, she cannot be a Whore.\n\n  For _Mahomet_ may dream of heavenly Stews,\n  Where Virgin Rose, soon as it's lost, renews,\n  And shake with every Breath of Air serene,\n  As trembling for the Rapes they've daily seen;\n  When if those past can shake their Height profound,\n  _Ridotto_ sure will fell them to the Ground;\n  Here Art to Nature join'd makes it compleat,\n  And Pyramids and Trees together meet;\n  Statues amidst the thickest Grove arise,\n  And lofty Columns tow'ring to the Skies;\n  Then next an Obelisk its Shade displays,\n  And rustic Rockwork fills each empty Space;\n  Each joins to make it noble, and excells\n  Beaufets for Food, Grotto's for something else.\n\n  But hark! the Doors on jarring Hinges turn,\n  All enter in, and the blest Scene's begun;\n  A thousand Lights their livid Flames display,\n  Pour forth their Blaze, and form a mimick Day:\n  Sudden a motley Mixture fills the Place,\n  And Footmen shine as lordly as his Grace;\n  To see the sad Effect and Power of Change,\n  Ladies turn'd Men, in Breeches freely range:\n  Young smooth-chin'd Beaux turn Priests and Fryars,\n  And Nun's chaste Habits hide our Country 'Squires.\n  _Belles, Beaux_, and Sharpers here together play,\n  And Wives throw their good Spouses Wealth away;\n  And when their Cash runs low, and Fate runs cross,\n  They then _Cornute_ 'em to retrieve their Loss.\n\n  _Dice_ and Intrigue so mutually are blended,\n  That one begins as soon as t'other's ended:\n  A City Heiress blooming, rich, and fair,\n  Picks up the Cards and Counters with great Care;\n  Against her fate a smooth young Baron,\n  Wit he had none, Beauty he had his share on,\n  A soft clear Skin, a dapper Neck and Waist,\n  In all Things suited to the modern Taste;\n  And most polite, like all our modish Brood,\n  That is, a very Fool, who's very leud:\n  He ogles Miss, she squints, and turns aside,\n  Nor can her Mask her rising Blushes hide;\n  At last (as Bargains here are quickly made)\n  She yeilds to be Caress'd, tho' still afraid;\n  She cries, a private Room's for them most fit,\n  For Reputation is the Glory of a Cit;\n  This only is the Place, where in a Trice,\n  Some Angel steals the Wounds of friendly Vice;\n  The Nymph finds a Relief for all her Pains,\n  And the lost Maidenhead's restor'd again.\n\n  But who is he in Bower close confin'd,\n  With a kind Fair t' unbend his troubled Mind,\n  Sure by his Air, his Beauty, and his Grace,\n  It _Phoebus_ is, or some of heavenly Race.\n\n  A petty Courtier, of small Estate and Sense,\n  Stood hearkning by, and cry'd it was the P----ce.\n\n  Your Pardon, Sir, I knew it not before,\n  For my Mistake depended on his Whore,\n  One had _Latona_ to'ther has _L----r_.\n\n  Next to the _Grotto_ let us bend our Eye,\n  The _Grotto_, Patron of Iniquity,\n  Speak O ye Trees with kind refreshing Shade,\n  How many Whores have at your Roots been made;\n  Alas; how small the Number to what now,\n  This one, this happy Night, alone will shew\n  So many, that each conscious _Dryad_ flees,\n  Lest she too should be ravish'd thro' the Trees.\n\n  Next rattling Dice invite th' attentive Ear,\n  Lords loudly laugh, as loud the Bullies swear:\n  The Country Knight o'th' Shire sells his Estate,\n  And here with Heart intrepid meets his Fate;\n  So they withdrew to quench their glowing Flame,\n  And to preserve the Honour of her Name;\n  For oh! sad Fate as they ascend the Stairs,\n  At the Room Door her good _Mamma_ appears,\n  Soon as she spies her Child with Looks demure,\n  She charges her to keep her _Vessel pure_:\n  Miss pertly answers to avoid her Doom,\n  _Mamma_, whose Hat and Wig is in the Room?\n  The good old Dame yeilds at the just Reproach,\n  Cries--_Well my Dear, don't take too much!_\n\n  Thus various Joys soon waste the fleeting Night,\n  And Sleep and Lust the Croud to Bed invite;\n  Some in their Truckle-Beds to snore all Day,\n  Others in Gambols with their Wh----es to play;\n  The Dunghill Trapes, trickt up like virtuous Trull,\n  If by good Chance, she gets a _Dupe_ or Cull;\n  On Tallyman intrudes twelve Hours more,\n  And for a clean Shift presumes to run a Score.\n\n  Sages may say, that Arts and Science fail,\n  And Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale:\n  In _England_ they have given new Arts a Rise,\n  And what in Science wants, increase in Vice,\n  And to be great as Angels when they fell,\n  (If not exceed) at _least_ they equal _Hell_.\n\n\n\n\n_FINIS._", "title": "The Ladies Delight"}
