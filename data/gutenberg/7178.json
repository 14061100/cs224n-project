{"summary": "The novel recounts the experiences of the Narrator (who is never definitively named) while he is growing up, learning about art, participating in society, and falling in love.\n\n\nThe Narrator begins by noting, \"For a long time, I went to bed early.\" He comments on the way sleep seems to alter one's surroundings, and the way Habit makes one indifferent to them. He remembers being in his room in the family's country home in Combray, while downstairs his parents entertain their friend Charles Swann, an elegant man of Jewish origin with strong ties to society. Due to Swann's visit, the Narrator is deprived of his mother's goodnight kiss, but he gets her to spend the night reading to him. This memory is the only one he has of Combray, until years later the taste of a madeleine cake dipped in tea inspires a nostalgic incident of involuntary memory. He remembers having a similar snack as a child with his invalid aunt Leonie, and it leads to more memories of Combray. He describes their servant Françoise, who is uneducated but possesses an earthy wisdom and a strong sense of both duty and tradition. He meets an elegant \"lady in pink\" while visiting his uncle Adolphe. He develops a love of the theater, especially the actress Berma, and his awkward Jewish friend Bloch introduces him to the works of the writer Bergotte. He learns Swann made an unsuitable marriage but has social ambitions for his beautiful daughter Gilberte. Legrandin, a snobbish friend of the family, tries to avoid introducing the boy to his well-to-do sister. The Narrator describes two routes for country walks the child and his parents often enjoyed: the way past Swann's home (the Méséglise way), and the Guermantes way, both containing scenes of natural beauty. Taking the Méséglise way, he sees Gilberte Swann standing in her yard with a lady in white, Mme Swann, and her supposed lover: Baron de Charlus, a friend of Swann's. Gilberte makes a gesture that the Narrator interprets as a rude dismissal. During another walk, he spies a lesbian scene involving Mlle Vinteuil, daughter of a composer, and her friend. The Guermantes way is symbolic of the Guermantes family, the nobility of the area. The Narrator is awed by the magic of their name, and is captivated when he first sees Mme de Guermantes. He discovers how appearances conceal the true nature of things, and tries writing a description of some nearby steeples. Lying in bed, he seems transported back to these places until he awakens.\nMme Verdurin is an autocratic hostess who, aided by her husband, demands total obedience from the guests in her \"little clan.\" One guest is Odette de Crecy, a former courtesan, who has met Swann and invites him to the group. Swann is too refined for such company, but Odette gradually intrigues him with her unusual style. A sonata by Vinteuil, which features a \"little phrase,\" becomes the motif for their deepening relationship. The Verdurins host M. de Forcheville; their guests include Cottard, a doctor; Brichot, an academic; Saniette, the object of scorn; and a painter, M. Biche. Swann grows jealous of Odette, who now keeps him at arm's length, and suspects an affair between her and Forcheville, aided by the Verdurins. Swann seeks respite by attending a society concert that includes Legrandin's sister and a young Mme de Guermantes; the \"little phrase\" is played and Swann realizes Odette's love for him is gone. He tortures himself wondering about her true relationships with others, but his love for her, despite renewals, gradually diminishes. He moves on and marvels that he ever loved a woman who was not his type.\n\nAt home in Paris, the Narrator dreams of visiting Venice or the church in Balbec, a resort, but he is too unwell and instead takes walks in the Champs-Élysées, where he meets and befriends Gilberte. He holds her father, now married to Odette, in the highest esteem, and is awed by the beautiful sight of Mme Swann strolling in public. Years later, the old sights of the area are long gone, and he laments the fugitive nature of places.\n\nThe Narrator's parents are inviting M. de Norpois, a diplomat colleague of the Narrator's father, to dinner. With Norpois's intervention, the Narrator is finally allowed to go see Berma perform in a play, but is disappointed by her acting. Afterwards, at dinner, he watches Norpois, who is extremely diplomatic and correct at all times, expound on society and art. The Narrator gives him a draft of his writing, but Norpois gently indicates it is not good. The Narrator continues to go to the Champs-Élysées and play with Gilberte. Her parents distrust him, so he writes to them in protest. He and Gilberte wrestle and he has an orgasm. Gilberte invites him to tea, and he becomes a regular at her house. He observes Mme Swann's inferior social status, Swann's lowered standards and indifference towards his wife, and Gilberte's affection for her father. The Narrator contemplates how he has attained his wish to know the Swanns, and savors their unique style. At one of their parties he meets and befriends Bergotte, who gives his impressions of society figures and artists. But the Narrator is still unable to start writing seriously. His friend Bloch takes him to a brothel, where there is a Jewish prostitute named Rachel. He showers Mme Swann with flowers, being almost on better terms with her than with Gilberte. One day, he and Gilberte quarrel and he decides never to see her again. However, he continues to visit Mme Swann, who has become a popular hostess, with her guests including Mme Bontemps, who has a niece named Albertine. The Narrator hopes for a letter from Gilberte repairing their friendship, but gradually feels himself losing interest. He breaks down and plans to reconcile with her, but spies from afar someone resembling her walking with a boy and gives her up for good. He stops visiting her mother also, who is now a celebrated beauty admired by passersby, and years later he can recall the glamour she displayed then.\nTwo years later, the Narrator, his grandmother, and Françoise set out for the seaside town of Balbec. The Narrator is almost totally indifferent to Gilberte now. During the train ride, his grandmother, who only believes in proper books, lends him her favorite: the Letters of Mme de Sevigne. At Balbec, the Narrator is disappointed with the church and uncomfortable in his unfamiliar hotel room, but his grandmother comforts him. He admires the seascape, and learns about the colorful staff and customers around the hotel: Aime, the discreet headwaiter; the lift operator; M. de Stermaria and his beautiful young daughter; and M. de Cambremer and his wife, Legrandin's sister. His grandmother encounters an old friend, the blue-blooded Mme de Villeparisis, and they renew their friendship. The three of them go for rides in the country, openly discussing art and politics. The Narrator longs for the country girls he sees alongside the roads, and has a strange feeling of unexplained memory while admiring a row of three trees. Mme de Villeparisis is joined by her glamorous great-nephew Robert de Saint-Loup, who is involved with an unsuitable woman. Despite initial awkwardness, the Narrator and his grandmother become good friends with him. Bloch, the childhood friend from Combray, turns up with his family, and acts in typically inappropriate fashion. Saint-Loup's ultra-aristocratic and extremely rude uncle the Baron de Charlus arrives. The Narrator discovers Mme de Villeparisis, her nephew M. de Charlus, and his nephew Saint-Loup are all of the Guermantes family. Charlus ignores the Narrator, but later visits him in his room and lends him a book. The next day, the Baron speaks shockingly informally to him, then demands the book back. The Narrator ponders Saint-Loup's attitude towards his aristocratic roots, and his relationship with his mistress, a mere actress whose recital bombed horribly with his family. One day, the Narrator sees a \"little band\" of teenage girls strolling beside the sea, and becomes infatuated with them, along with an unseen hotel guest named Mlle Simonet. He joins Saint-Loup for dinner and reflects on how drunkenness affects his perceptions. Later they meet the painter Elstir, and the Narrator visits his studio. The Narrator marvels at Elstir's method of renewing impressions of ordinary things, as well as his connections with the Verdurins (he is \"M. Biche\") and Mme Swann. He discovers the painter knows the teenage girls, particularly one dark-haired beauty who is Albertine Simonet. Elstir arranges an introduction, and the Narrator becomes friends with her, as well as her friends Andrée, Rosemonde, and Gisele. The group goes for picnics and tours the countryside, as well as playing games, while the Narrator reflects on the nature of love as he becomes attracted to Albertine. Despite her rejection, they become close, although he still feels attracted to the whole group. At summer's end, the town closes up, and the Narrator is left with his image of first seeing the girls walking beside the sea.\n\n\nThe Narrator's family has moved to an apartment connected with the Guermantes residence. Françoise befriends a fellow tenant, the tailor Jupien and his niece. The Narrator is fascinated by the Guermantes and their life, and is awed by their social circle while attending another Berma performance. He begins staking out the street where Mme de Guermantes walks every day, to her evident annoyance. He decides to visit her nephew Saint-Loup at his military base, to ask to be introduced to her. After noting the landscape and his state of mind while sleeping, the Narrator meets and attends dinners with Saint-Loup's fellow officers, where they discuss the Dreyfus Affair and the art of military strategy. But the Narrator returns home after receiving a call from his aging grandmother. Mme de Guermantes declines to see him, and he also finds he is still unable to begin writing. Saint-Loup visits on leave, and they have lunch and attend a recital with his actress mistress: Rachel, the Jewish prostitute, toward whom the unsuspecting Saint-Loup is crazed with jealousy. The Narrator then goes to Mme de Villeparisis's salon, which is considered second-rate despite its public reputation. Legrandin attends and displays his social climbing. Bloch stridently interrogates M. de Norpois about the Dreyfus Affair, which has ripped all of society asunder, but Norpois diplomatically avoids answering. The Narrator observes Mme de Guermantes and her aristocratic bearing, as she makes caustic remarks about friends and family, including the mistresses of her husband, who is M. de Charlus's brother. Mme Swann arrives, and the Narrator remembers a visit from Morel, the son of his uncle Adolphe's valet, who revealed that the \"lady in pink\" was Mme Swann. Charlus asks the Narrator to leave with him, and offers to make him his protégé. At home, the Narrator's grandmother has worsened, and while walking with him she suffers a stroke.\nThe family seeks out the best medical help, and she is often visited by Bergotte, himself unwell, but she dies, her face reverting to its youthful appearance. Several months later, Saint-Loup, now single, convinces the Narrator to ask out the Stermaria daughter, newly divorced. Albertine visits; she has matured and they share a kiss. The Narrator then goes to see Mme de Villeparisis, where Mme de Guermantes, whom he has stopped following, invites him to dinner. The Narrator daydreams of Mme de Stermaria, but she abruptly cancels, although Saint-Loup rescues him from despair by taking him to dine with his aristocratic friends, who engage in petty gossip. Saint-Loup passes on an invitation from Charlus to come visit him. The next day, at the Guermantes's dinner party, the Narrator admires their Elstir paintings, then meets the cream of society, including the Princess of Parma, who is an amiable simpleton. He learns more about the Guermantes: their hereditary features; their less-refined cousins the Courvoisiers; and Mme de Guermantes's celebrated humor, artistic tastes, and exalted diction (although she does not live up to the enchantment of her name). The discussion turns to gossip about society, including Charlus and his late wife; the affair between Norpois and Mme de Villeparisis; and aristocratic lineages. Leaving, the Narrator visits Charlus, who falsely accuses him of slandering him. The Narrator stomps on Charlus's hat and storms out, but Charlus is strangely unperturbed and gives him a ride home. Months later, the Narrator is invited to the Princesse de Guermantes's party. He tries to verify the invitation with M. and Mme de Guermantes, but first sees something he will describe later. They will be attending the party but do not help him, and while they are chatting, Swann arrives. Now a committed Dreyfusard, he is very sick and nearing death, but the Guermantes assure him he will outlive them.\n\n\nThe Narrator describes what he had seen earlier: while waiting for the Guermantes to return so he could ask about his invitation, he saw Charlus encounter Jupien in their courtyard. The two then went into Jupien's shop and had intercourse. The Narrator reflects on the nature of \"inverts\", and how they are like a secret society, never able to live in the open. He compares them to flowers, whose reproduction through the aid of insects depends solely on happenstance. Arriving at the Princesse's party, his invitation seems valid as he is greeted warmly by her. He sees Charlus exchanging knowing looks with the diplomat Vaugobert, a fellow invert. After several tries, the Narrator manages to be introduced to the Prince de Guermantes, who then walks off with Swann, causing speculation on the topic of their conversation. Mme de Saint-Euverte tries to recruit guests for her party the next day, but is subjected to scorn from some of the Guermantes. Charlus is captivated by the two young sons of M. de Guermantes's newest mistress. Saint-Loup arrives and mentions the names of several promiscuous women to the Narrator. Swann takes the Narrator aside and reveals the Prince wanted to admit his and his wife's pro-Dreyfus leanings. Swann is aware of his old friend Charlus's behavior, then urges the Narrator to visit Gilberte, and departs. The Narrator leaves with M. and Mme de Guermantes, and heads home for a late-night meeting with Albertine. He grows frantic when first she is late and then calls to cancel, but he convinces her to come. He writes an indifferent letter to Gilberte, and reviews the changing social scene, which now includes Mme Swann's salon centered on Bergotte.\nHe decides to return to Balbec, after learning the women mentioned by Saint-Loup will be there. At Balbec, grief at his grandmother's suffering, which was worse than he knew, overwhelms him. He ponders the intermittencies of the heart and the ways of dealing with sad memories. His mother, even sadder, has become more like his grandmother in homage. Albertine is nearby and they begin spending time together, but he starts to suspect her of lesbianism and of lying to him about her activities. He fakes a preference for her friend Andrée to make her become more trustworthy, and it works, but he soon suspects her of knowing several scandalous women at the hotel, including Lea, an actress. On the way to visit Saint-Loup, they meet Morel, the valet's son who is now an excellent violinist, and then the aging Charlus, who falsely claims to know Morel and goes to speak to him. The Narrator visits the Verdurins, who are renting a house from the Cambremers. On the train with him is the little clan: Brichot, who explains at length the derivation of the local place-names; Cottard, now a celebrated doctor; Saniette, still the butt of everyone's ridicule; and a new member, Ski. The Verdurins are still haughty and dictatorial toward their guests, who are as pedantic as ever. Charlus and Morel arrive together, and Charlus's true nature is barely concealed. The Cambremers arrive, and the Verdurins barely tolerate them.\nBack at the hotel, the Narrator ruminates on sleep and time, and observes the amusing mannerisms of the staff, who are mostly aware of Charlus's proclivities. The Narrator and Albertine hire a chauffeur and take rides in the country, leading to observations about new forms of travel as well as country life. The Narrator is unaware that the chauffeur and Morel are acquainted, and he reviews Morel's amoral character and plans towards Jupien's niece. The Narrator is jealously suspicious of Albertine but grows tired of her. She and the Narrator attend evening dinners at the Verdurins, taking the train with the other guests; Charlus is now a regular, despite his obliviousness to the clan's mockery. He and Morel try to maintain the secret of their relationship, and the Narrator recounts a ploy involving a fake duel that Charlus used to control Morel. The passing station stops remind the Narrator of various people and incidents, including two failed attempts by the Prince de Guermantes to arrange liaisons with Morel; a final break between the Verdurins and Cambremers; and a misunderstanding between the Narrator, Charlus, and Bloch. The Narrator has grown weary of the area and prefers others over Albertine. But she reveals to him as they leave the train that she has plans with Mlle Vinteuil and her friend (the lesbians from Combray) which plunges him into despair. He invents a story about a broken engagement of his, to convince her to go to Paris with him, and after hesitating she suddenly agrees to go immediately. The Narrator tells his mother: he must marry Albertine.\n\n\nThe Narrator is living with Albertine in his family's apartment, to Françoise's distrust and his absent mother's chagrin. He marvels that he has come to possess her, but has grown bored with her. He mostly stays home, but has enlisted Andrée to report on Albertine's whereabouts, as his jealousy remains. The Narrator gets advice on fashion from Mme de Guermantes, and encounters Charlus and Morel visiting Jupien and her niece, who is being married off to Morel despite his cruelty towards her. One day, the Narrator returns from the Guermantes and finds Andrée just leaving, claiming to dislike the smell of their flowers. Albertine, who is more guarded to avoid provoking his jealousy, is maturing into an intelligent and elegant young lady. The Narrator is entranced by her beauty as she sleeps, and is only content when she is not out with others. She mentions wanting to go to the Verdurins, but the Narrator suspects an ulterior motive and analyzes her conversation for hints. He suggests she go instead to the Trocadéro with Andrée, and she reluctantly agrees. The Narrator compares dreams to wakefulness, and listens to the street vendors with Albertine, then she departs. He remembers trips she took with the chauffeur, then learns Lea the notorious actress will be at the Trocadero too. He sends Françoise to retrieve Albertine, and while waiting, he muses on music and Morel. When she returns, they go for a drive, while he pines for Venice and realizes she feels captive. He learns of Bergotte's final illness. That evening, he sneaks off to the Verdurins to try to discover the reason for Albertine's interest in them. He encounters Brichot on the way, and they discuss Swann, who has died. Charlus arrives and the Narrator reviews the Baron's struggles with Morel, then learns Mlle Vinteuil and her friend are expected (although they do not come). Morel joins in performing a septet by Vinteuil, which evokes commonalities with his sonata that only the composer could create. Mme Verdurin is furious that Charlus has taken control of her party; in revenge the Verdurins persuade Morel to repudiate him, and Charlus falls temporarily ill from the shock. Returning home, the Narrator and Albertine fight about his solo visit to the Verdurins, and she denies having affairs with Lea or Mlle Vinteuil, but admits she lied on occasion to avoid arguments. He threatens to break it off, but they reconcile. He appreciates art and fashion with her, and ponders her mysteriousness. But his suspicion of her and Andrée is renewed, and they quarrel. After two awkward days and a restless night, he resolves to end the affair, but in the morning Françoise informs him: Albertine has asked for her boxes and left.\n\nThe Narrator is anguished at Albertine's departure and absence. He dispatches Saint-Loup to convince her aunt Mme Bontemps to send her back, but Albertine insists the Narrator should ask, and she will gladly return. The Narrator lies and replies he is done with her, but she just agrees with him. He writes to her that he will marry Andrée, then hears from Saint-Loup of the failure of his mission to the aunt. Desperate, he begs Albertine to return, but receives word: she has died in a riding accident. He receives two last letters from her: one wishing him and Andrée well, and one asking if she can return. The Narrator plunges into suffering amid the many different memories of Albertine, intimately linked to all of his everyday sensations. He recalls a suspicious incident she told him of at Balbec, and asks Aime, the headwaiter, to investigate. He recalls their history together and his regrets, as well as love's randomness. Aime reports back: Albertine often engaged in affairs with girls at Balbec. The Narrator sends him to learn more, and he reports other liaisons with girls. The Narrator wishes he could have known the true Albertine, whom he would have accepted. He begins to grow accustomed to the idea of her death, despite constant reminders that renew his grief. Andrée admits her own lesbianism but denies being with Albertine. The Narrator knows he will forget Albertine, just as he has forgotten Gilberte.\nHe happens to meet Gilberte again; her mother Mme Swann became Mme de Forcheville and Gilberte is now part of high society, received by the Guermantes. The Narrator finally publishes an article in Le Figaro. Andrée visits him and confesses relations with Albertine and also explains the truth behind her departure: her aunt wanted her to marry another man. The Narrator finally visits Venice with his mother, which enthralls him in every aspect. They happen to see Norpois and Mme de Villeparisis there. A telegram signed from Albertine arrives, but the Narrator is indifferent and it is only a misprint anyway. Returning home, the Narrator and his mother receive surprising news: Gilberte will marry Saint-Loup, and Jupien's niece will be adopted by Charlus and then married to Legrandin's nephew, an invert. There is much discussion of these marriages among society. The Narrator visits Gilberte in her new home, and is shocked to learn of Saint-Loup's affair with Morel, among others. He despairs for their friendship.\n\n\nThe Narrator is staying with Gilberte at her home near Combray. They go for walks, on one of which he is stunned to learn the Méséglise way and the Guermantes way are actually linked. Gilberte also tells him she was attracted to him when young, and had made a suggestive gesture to him as he watched her. Also, it was Lea she was walking with the evening he had planned to reconcile with her. He considers Saint-Loup's nature and reads an account of the Verdurins' salon, deciding he has no talent for writing.\nThe scene shifts to a night in 1916, during World War I, when the Narrator has returned to Paris from a stay in a sanatorium and is walking the streets during a blackout. He reflects on the changed norms of art and society, with the Verdurins now highly esteemed. He recounts a 1914 visit from Saint-Loup, who was trying to enlist secretly. He recalls descriptions of the fighting he subsequently received from Saint-Loup and Gilberte, whose home was threatened. He describes a call paid on him a few days previously by Saint-Loup; they discussed military strategy. Now on the dark street, the Narrator encounters Charlus, who has completely surrendered to his impulses. Charlus reviews Morel's betrayals and his own temptation to seek vengeance; critiques Brichot's new fame as a writer, which has ostracized him from the Verdurins; and admits his general sympathy with Germany. The last part of the conversation draws a crowd of suspicious onlookers. After parting the Narrator seeks refuge in what appears to be hotel, where he sees someone who looks familiar leaving. Inside, he discovers it to be a male brothel, and spies Charlus using the services. The proprietor turns out to be Jupien, who expresses a perverse pride in his business. A few days later, news comes that Saint-Loup has been killed in combat. The Narrator pieces together that Saint-Loup had visited Jupien's brothel, and ponders what might have been had he lived.\nYears later, again in Paris, the Narrator goes to a party at the house of the Prince de Guermantes. On the way he sees Charlus, now a mere shell of his former self, being helped by Jupien. The paving stones at the Guermantes house inspire another incident of involuntary memory for the Narrator, quickly followed by two more. Inside, while waiting in the library, he discerns their meaning: by putting him in contact with both the past and present, the impressions allow him to gain a vantage point outside time, affording a glimpse of the true nature of things. He realizes his whole life has prepared him for the mission of describing events as fully revealed, and (finally) resolves to begin writing. Entering the party, he is shocked at the disguises old age has given to the people he knew, and at the changes in society. Legrandin is now an invert, but is no longer a snob. Bloch is a respected writer and vital figure in society. Morel has reformed and become a respected citizen. Mme de Forcheville is the mistress of M. de Guermantes. Mme Verdurin has married the Prince de Guermantes after both their spouses died. Rachel is the star of the party, abetted by Mme de Guermantes, whose social position has been eroded by her affinity for theater. Gilberte introduces her daughter to the Narrator; he is struck by the way the daughter encapsulates both the Méséglise and Guermantes ways within herself. He is spurred to writing, with help from Françoise and despite signs of approaching death. He realizes that every person carries within them the accumulated baggage of their past, and concludes that to be accurate he must describe how everyone occupies an immense range \"in Time\".\n\n", "full_text": "SWANN'S WAY\n\nRemembrance Of Things Past, Volume One\n\n\nBy Marcel Proust\n\n\nTranslated From The French By C. K. Scott Moncrieff\n\nNEW YORK HENRY HOLT AND COMPANY 1922\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\nOVERTURE\n\nCOMBRAY\n\nSWANN IN LOVE\n\nPLACE-NAMES: THE NAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERTURE\n\nFor a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out\nmy candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to\nsay \"I'm going to sleep.\" And half an hour later the thought that it was\ntime to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book\nwhich, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I\nhad been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just\nbeen reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own,\nuntil I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book:\na church, a quartet, the rivalry between Fran�ois I and Charles V. This\nimpression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not\ndisturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them\nfrom registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then\nit would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former\nexistence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would\nseparate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form\npart of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I\nwould be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and\nrestful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to\nwhich it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark\nindeed.\n\nI would ask myself what o'clock it could be; I could hear the whistling\nof trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the\ndistance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective\nthe deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying\ntowards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for\never in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange\nplace, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to\nfarewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his\nears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of\nbeing once again at home.\n\nI would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my\npillow, as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would\nstrike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an\ninvalid, who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a\nstrange hotel, awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief\na streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys!\nit is morning. The servants will be about in a minute: he can ring,\nand some one will come to look after him. The thought of being made\ncomfortable gives him strength to endure his pain. He is certain he\nheard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light\nbeneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned\nout the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night\nin agony with no one to bring him any help.\n\nI would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches\nonly, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or\nto open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness,\nto savour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay\nheavy upon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I\nformed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very\nsoon return to share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned\nwithout the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever\noutgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors,\nsuch as that old terror of my great-uncle's pulling my curls, which was\neffectually dispelled on the day--the dawn of a new era to me--on which\nthey were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event\nduring my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in\nmaking myself wake up to escape my great-uncle's fingers; still, as a\nmeasure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow\nbefore returning to the world of dreams.\n\nSometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman\nwould come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some\nstrain in the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was\non the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that\ngratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating\nhers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest\nof humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose\ncompany I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her\nkiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes\nhappen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking\nhours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like\npeople who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city\nthat they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste\nin reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory\nof her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my\ndream.\n\nWhen a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the\nhours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host.\nInstinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant\nreads off his own position on the earth's surface and the amount of time\nthat has elapsed during his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt\nto grow confused, and to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning,\nafter a night of insomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading,\nin quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to\nsleep, he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back\nin its course, and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the\ntime, but will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he\ngets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair,\nsay, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit,\nthe magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space,\nand when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep\nmonths earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough\nif, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my\nconsciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had\ngone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was,\nI could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary\nsense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an\nanimal's consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the\ncave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I\nwas, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very\npossibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up\nout of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped\nby myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of\ncivilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps,\nfollowed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by\ndegrees the component parts of my ego.\n\nPerhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon\nthem by our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else,\nand by the immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened\nthat when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful\nattempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me\nthrough the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy\nwith sleep to move, would make an effort to construe the form which its\ntiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so as to induce\nfrom that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together\nand to give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory,\nthe composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it\na whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept;\nwhile the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the shape\nof each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the\ndarkness. And even before my brain, lingering in consideration of when\nthings had happened and of what they had looked like, had collected\nsufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room, it, my body,\nwould recall from each room in succession what the bed was like, where\nthe doors were, how daylight came in at the windows, whether there was a\npassage outside, what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep, and had\nfound there when I awoke. The stiffened side underneath my body would,\nfor instance, in trying to fix its position, imagine itself to be lying,\nface to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy; and at once I would say to\nmyself, \"Why, I must have gone to sleep after all, and Mamma never came\nto say good night!\" for I was in the country with my grandfather, who\ndied years ago; and my body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally\npreserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have\nforgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the\nnight-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn and hung\nby chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble in my\nbedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt's house, in those far distant days\nwhich, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly\npenned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly\nawake.\n\nThen would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in\nanother direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup's house in the\ncountry; good heavens, it must be ten o'clock, they will have finished\ndinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always\ntake when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before\ndressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the\nCombray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would\nstill be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the\npanes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence\nat Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of\npleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from\nvisiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in\nthe sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep\ninstead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return\nfrom our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary\nbeacon in the night.\n\nThese shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than\na few seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to\nwhere I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that\nuncertainty was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running,\nwe isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon\na bioscope. But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in\nwhich I had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them\nall in the long course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on\ngoing to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the\nmost diverse materials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets,\na piece of a shawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper,\nall of which things I would contrive, with the infinite patience of\nbirds building their nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in\na keen frost, I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the\nouter world (like the sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark\ntunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth), and where, the fire\nkeeping in all night, I would sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great\ncloak of snug and savoury air, shot with the glow of the logs which\nwould break out again in flame: in a sort of alcove without walls, a\ncave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat\nwhose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature\nas gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face, from\nthe corners of the room, or from parts near the window or far from the\nfireplace which had therefore remained cold--or rooms in summer, where\nI would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening, where the\nmoonlight striking upon the half-opened shutters would throw down to the\nfoot of my bed its enchanted ladder; where I would fall asleep, as it\nmight be in the open air, like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised\nin the focus of a sunbeam--or sometimes the Louis XVI room, so cheerful\nthat I could never feel really unhappy, even on my first night in it:\nthat room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling\nwould part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where the bed was and\nto keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with the high\nceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys,\nand partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment my mind\nwas drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses, convinced of\nthe hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of\na clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not\nthere; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet, which\nstood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site I had not\nlooked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of\nvision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on end\nto leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the\nexact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous\nfunnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched\nout in bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils\nsniffing uneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the\ncolour of the curtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression\nof pity to the cruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even\ncompletely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly\nreduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but\nunhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end\nwith her provisional arrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is\nfortunate in discovering, for without the help of custom it would never\ncontrive, by its own efforts, to make any room seem habitable.\n\nCertainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last\ntime and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding\nobjects stand still, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom,\nand had fixed, approximately in their right places in the uncertain\nlight, my chest of drawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window\noverlooking the street, and both the doors. But it was no good my\nknowing that I was not in any of those houses of which, in the stupid\nmoment of waking, if I had not caught sight exactly, I could still\nbelieve in their possible presence; for memory was now set in motion; as\na rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once, but used to spend\nthe greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at\nCombray with my great-aunt, at Balbec, Paris, Donci�res, Venice, and the\nrest; remembering again all the places and people that I had known, what\nI had actually seen of them, and what others had told me.\n\nAt Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should\nhave to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my\nmother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my\nmelancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy\nidea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally\nwretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while\nwe waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders\nand glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness\nof my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many\ncolours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory\nwindow. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of\nlighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary\nimpression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself,\nbut for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite\nendurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as\nthough I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place\nwhere I had just arrived, by train, for the first time.\n\nRiding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design,\nissued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the\nslope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the\ncastle of poor Genevi�ve de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by\na curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the\ntransparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through\na slot in the lantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front\nof it stretched a moor on which Genevi�ve stood, lost in contemplation,\nwearing a blue girdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could\ntell their colour without waiting to see them, for before the slides\nmade their appearance the old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given\nme an unmistakable clue. Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to\nthe little speech read aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly\nto understand, for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid\nof a degree of majesty, so as to conform to the indications given in the\ntext; then he rode away at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest\nhis slow progress. If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish\nGolo's horse advancing across the window-curtains, swelling out with\ntheir curves and diving into their folds. The body of Golo himself,\nbeing of the same supernatural substance as his steed's, overcame all\nmaterial obstacles--everything that seemed to bar his way--by taking\neach as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself: the\ndoor-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at once, would\nfloat invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing its\nnobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such a\ntransubstantiation.\n\nAnd, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which\nseemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed\naround me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express\nthe discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into\na room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until\nI thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect\nof custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very\nmelancholy things. The door-handle of my room, which was different to\nme from all the other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to\nopen of its own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious\nhad its manipulation become; lo and behold, it was now an astral body\nfor Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the\ndining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard\nbut well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef, shed the\nsame light as on every other evening; and I would fall into the arms of\nmy mother, whom the misfortunes of Genevi�ve de Brabant had made all the\ndearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than\nordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience.\n\nBut after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed\ntalking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little\nparlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my\ngrandmother, who held that \"It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the\ncountry,\" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the\nvery wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book\ninstead of letting me stay out of doors. \"That is not the way to make\nhim strong and active,\" she would say sadly, \"especially this little\nman, who needs all the strength and character that he can get.\" My\nfather would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an\ninterest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not\nto disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard,\nnot wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my\ngrandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in\ntorrents and Fran�oise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker\narmchairs, so that they should not get soaked--you would see my\ngrandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing\nback her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to\nimbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, \"At\nlast one can breathe!\" and would run up and down the soaking paths--too\nstraight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any\nfeeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking\nall morning if the weather were going to improve--with her keen, jerky\nlittle step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by\nthe intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of\nmy education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for\nthat was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the\nspots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which\nalways provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh\ndespair.\n\nWhen these walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner there was\none thing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if\n(at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her,\nmoth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs\nwere set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her:\n\"Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!\" For,\nsimply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my\nfather's family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to\nmake my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops.\nMy poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to\ntaste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops\nall the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still\nsmiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards\nothers, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own\ntroubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those\nseen on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save\nfor herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes,\nwhich could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow\nupon them passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my\ngreat-aunt, the sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in\nher weakness conquered before she began, but still making the futile\nendeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur-glass--all these\nwere things of the sort to which, in later years, one can grow so well\naccustomed as to smile at them, to take the tormentor's side with a.\nhappy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not,\nreally, tormenting; but in those days they filled me with such horror\nthat I longed to strike my great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her\n\"Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!\" in my\ncowardice I became at once a man, and did what all we grown men do when\nface to face with suffering and injustice; I preferred not to see them;\nI ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room\nbeside the schoolroom and beneath the roof, which smelt of orris-root,\nand was scented also by a wild currant-bush which had climbed up between\nthe stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through\nthe half-opened window. Intended for a more special and a baser use,\nthis room, from which, in the daytime, I could see as far as the keep of\nRoussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time my place of refuge, doubtless\nbecause it was the only room whose door � was allowed to lock, whenever\nmy occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude; reading or\ndreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of desire. Alas! I little knew\nthat my own lack of will-power, my delicate health, and the consequent\nuncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother's\nmind than any little breach of the rules by her husband, during those\nendless perambulations, afternoon and evening, in which we used to see\npassing up and down, obliquely raised towards the heavens, her handsome\nface with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with age had acquired\nalmost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn, covered, if she were\nwalking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon them either the\ncold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an\ninvoluntary tear.\n\nMy sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma\nwould come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted\nfor so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in\nwhich I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her\ngarden dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited\nstraw, rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment\nof the keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached\nthe stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as\nto prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have\nappeared. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I\nlonged to call her back, to say to her \"Kiss me just once again,\" but\nI knew that then she would at once look displeased, for the concession\nwhich she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with\nthis kiss of peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies\nabsurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the\nneed, the custom of having her there at all, which was a very different\nthing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional\nkiss when she was already crossing the threshold. And to see her look\ndispleased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a\nmoment before, when she bent her loving face down over my bed, and held\nit out to me like a Host, for an act of Communion in which my lips might\ndrink deeply the sense of her real presence, and with it the power to\nsleep. But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in\nmy room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests\nto dinner, and therefore she did not come at all. Our 'guests'\nwere practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few passing\nstrangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the house at\nCombray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently since\nhis unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his wife)\nand sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we sat\nin front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron\ntable, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and\nnoisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its\nferruginous, interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who\nhad put it out of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double\npeal--timid, oval, gilded--of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once\nexclaim \"A visitor! Who in the world can it be?\" but they knew quite\nwell that it could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud\nvoice, to set an example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound\nnatural, would tell the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be\nmore unpleasant for a stranger coming in, who would be led to think that\npeople were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear; and\nthen my grandmother would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find\nan excuse for an additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise\nto remove surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or\ntwo, so as to make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother\nmight run her hand through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed\nit down, to make it stick out properly round his head.\n\nAnd there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from\nmy grandmother's lips when she brought us back her report of the\nenemy, as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of\npossible invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: \"I\ncan hear Swann's voice.\" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his\nvoice, for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose\nand green eyes, under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red\nhair, dressed in the Bressant style, because in the garden we used as\nlittle light as possible, so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would\nslip away as though not going for anything in particular, to tell them\nto bring out the syrups; for my grandmother made a great point, thinking\nit 'nicer' of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the\nordinary, which we kept for visitors only. Although a far younger man,\nM. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather, who had been an\nintimate friend, in his time, of Swann's father, an excellent but an\neccentric man in whom the least little thing would, it seemed, often\ncheck the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts.\nSeveral times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell\nat table the story, which never varied, of the behaviour of M. Swann the\nelder upon the death of his wife, by whose bedside he had watched\nday and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time,\nhastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on the outskirts of\nCombray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping profusely, out\nof the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when the body was\nlaid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park, where there was\na little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm\nand cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be walking\nhere together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty they are,\nall these trees--my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you have never\ncongratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you feel this\nlittle breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive all the\nsame, my dear Am�d�e!\" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife\nreturned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire\ninto how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried\naway by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which\nhe habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his\nmind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes,\nand wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of\nhis wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for\nwhich he survived her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think\nof my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time.\"\n\"Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,\" became one of my\ngrandfather's favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of\nthings. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann's had been\na monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than\nmyself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to\npardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not\ngone on to exclaim, \"But, after all, he had a heart of gold.\"\n\nFor many years, albeit--and especially before his marriage--M. Swann\nthe younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and\ngrandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the\nkind of society which his family had frequented, or that, under the\nsort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were\nharbouring--with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers\nwho have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know\nit--one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club, a particular friend\nof the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales, and one of the\nmen most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain.\n\nOur utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in\nthe world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and\ndiscretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days\ntook what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist\nof sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself\ncalled to that station in life which his parents already occupied,\nand nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good'\nmarriage, could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior\ncaste. M. Swann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so 'young\nSwann' found himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as\nin a list of taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income.\nWe knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew\nhis own associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.'\nIf he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on\nwhom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes\nall the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an\norphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been\nready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew\nwere of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had\nhe met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a\nthing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar\nto himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in\nhis father's position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than\ntheirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had\na craze for 'antiques' and pictures, he now lived and piled up his\ncollections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit,\nbut which stood on the Quai d'Orl�ans, a neighbourhood in which my\ngreat-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. \"Are you really\na connoisseur, now?\" she would say to him; \"I ask for your own sake, as\nyou are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers,\" for\nshe did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no\ngreat opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would\navoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when\nhe gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but\neven when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art. When\nchallenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his admiration for\nsome picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and would then\nmake amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other about the\ngallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it had been\npainted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse\nus by telling us the story of his latest adventure--and he would have\na fresh story for us on every occasion--with some one whom we ourselves\nknew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman. These\nstories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could\nnever tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann\ninvariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he\nshewed in telling us of them. \"It is easy to see that you are a regular\n'character,' M. Swann!\"\n\nAs she was the only member of our family who could be described as a\ntrifle 'common,' she would always take care to remark to strangers, when\nSwann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have\nlived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l'Op�ra, and that\nhe was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million\nfrancs, but that it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought\nwas bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann\ncalled on New Year's Day bringing her a little packet of _marrons\nglac�s_, she never failed, if there were strangers in the room, to say\nto him: \"Well, M. Swann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded\nVaults, so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to\nLyons?\" and she would peep out of the corner of her eye, over her\nglasses, at the other visitors.\n\nBut if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his\ncapacity as the son of old M. Swann, was 'fully qualified' to be\nreceived by any of the 'upper middle class,' the most respected\nbarristers and solicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle\ninclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another\nalmost secret existence of a wholly different kind: that when he left\nour house in Paris, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no\nsooner have turned the corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and\nbe off to some drawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate\nof stockbrokers had ever set eyes--that would have seemed to my aunt\nas extraordinary as, to a woman of wider reading, the thought of being\nherself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus, of knowing that he would,\nwhen he had finished his conversation with her, plunge deep into the\nrealms of Thetis, into an empire veiled from mortal eyes, in which\nVirgil depicts him as being received with open arms; or--to be content\nwith an image more likely to have occurred to her, for she had seen it\npainted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray--as the thought\nof having had to dinner Ali Baba, who, as soon as he found himself alone\nand unobserved, would make his way into the cave, resplendent with its\nunsuspected treasures.\n\nOne day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged\npardon for being in evening clothes, Fran�oise, when he had gone, told\nus that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining \"with a\nprincess.\" \"A pretty sort of princess,\" drawled my aunt; \"I know\nthem,\" and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her\nknitting, serenely ironical.\n\nAltogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was\nof the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she\nthought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in\nsummer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden,\nand that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some\nphotographs of old masters for me.\n\nIt seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted\na recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of\nour big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not\nseeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who\nmight be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned\nupon the Princes of the House of France, \"Gentlemen, you and I will\nnever know, will we, and don't want to, do we?\" my great-aunt would\nsay tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his\npocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on\nevenings when my grandmother's sister sang; manipulating this creature,\nso rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough\nsimplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no\nmore carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was\na familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from,\nthe Swann created in my great-aunt's mind when, of an evening, in our\nlittle garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the\ngate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever\nheard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which\nbegan to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background\nof shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice.\nBut then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none\nof us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for\neveryone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or\nthe record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts\nof other people. Even the simple act which we describe as \"seeing some\none we know\" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the\nphysical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have\nalready formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we\ncompose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In\nthe end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to\nfollow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in\nthe sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent\nenvelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our\nown ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no\ndoubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family\nhad left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his\ndaily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other\npeople, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and\nstopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but\nthey contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had\nbeen evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant\nin the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not\nunpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together\nafter our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during\nour companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so\nwell lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his\nfamily, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete\nand living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving\nsome one I know for another quite different person when, going back in\nmemory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately\nto this early Swann--this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the\ncharming mistakes of my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like\nhis successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as\nthough one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits\nof any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak)\ntonality--this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent\nof the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of\ntarragon.\n\nAnd yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a\nlady whom she had known at the Sacr� Coeur (and with whom, because of\nour caste theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in\nspite of several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the\nfamous house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:\n\n\"I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my\nnephews, the des Laumes.\"\n\nMy grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house,\nwhich overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had\nadvised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his\ndaughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had\ngone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the\nstaircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the\ngirl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man,\nthe finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing\nwholly independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some\nanswer the tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n\n\"S�vign� would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a\nnephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n\n\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n\nNow, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him\nin my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It\nappeared that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we\nowed to Mme. de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to\ndo nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that\nshe had failed in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and\nin allowing members of her family to associate with him. \"How should\nshe know Swann? A lady who, you always made out, was related to Marshal\nMacMahon!\" This view of Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my\nfamily seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of\nthe worst class, you might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him\njustice, he never attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come\nto us alone, though he came more and more seldom; but from whom they\nthought they could establish, on the assumption that he had found her\nthere, the circle, unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n\nBut on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was\none of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the\nDuc de X----, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent\nstatesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious\nto learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental\nshare in the private lives of men like Mole, the Duc Pasquier, or the\nDuc de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with\npeople who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this\npiece of news in a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose\nhis associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred,\noutside his 'proper station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her\neyes. It seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the\nfruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which\nprudent parents cultivate and store up for their children's benefit, for\nmy great-aunt had actually ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we\nhad known because he had married a 'Highness' and had thereby stepped\ndown--in her eyes--from the respectable position of a lawyer's son to\nthat of those adventurers, upstart footmen or stable-boys mostly,\nto whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours. She\nobjected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of questioning Swann, when\nnext he came to dine with us, about these people whose friendship with\nhim we had discovered. On the other hand, my grandmother's two sisters,\nelderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her\nintelligence, declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their\nbrother-in-law could find in talking about such trifles. They were\nladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were incapable of taking\nthe least interest in what might be called the 'pinchbeck' things of\nlife, even when they had an historic value, or, generally speaking, in\nanything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically\nprecious. So complete was their negation of interest in anything which\nseemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their\nsense of hearing--which had gradually come to understand its own\nfutility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table, became\nfrivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able to\nguide it back to the topic dear to themselves--would leave its receptive\nchannels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually becoming\natrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of\nthe two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm signals\nas mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as by\nbeating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them\nat the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent\nmethods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their\neveryday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or\nbecause they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n\nTheir interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine\nwith us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti,\nmy great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to\nthe name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the\nwords, \"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see\nthat Swann is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?\"\n\n\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty\nof taste.\"\n\n\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to\nseem different from _us_.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed\nwith her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion\nwhich the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us\na wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she\nhoped to force us into solidarity with her own.\n\nBut we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire\nto mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt\ndissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however\ntrivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it\nwas no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to\nhave to envy them.\n\n\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should\nhate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper,\nand I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n\nShe did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's\nsisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a\nfine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious\ncircumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person\nto whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of\nmanaging to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his\nwife, but of his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was\nunderstood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n\n\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very\nhard for him.\"\n\nMy father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd\nideas. It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n\nBut the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave\nrise to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the\nevenings when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma\ndid not come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with\nthe family: I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said\ngood night and went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier\nthan the others, and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight\no'clock, when it was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and\nprecious kiss which Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I\nwas in bed and just going to sleep I had to take with me from the\ndining-room to my own, and to keep inviolate all the time that it\ntook me to undress, without letting its sweet charm be broken, without\nletting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate; and just on\nthose very evenings when I must needs take most pains to receive it with\ndue formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it instantly and in public,\nwithout even having the time or being properly free to apply to what I\nwas doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to\nexclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a\ndoor, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again\nthey can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the\nprecise moment in which the door was shut.\n\nWe were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded\nshyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one\nanother inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n\n\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather\nwarned his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a\nhuge case.\"\n\n\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like\nto come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n\n\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it\nwill be fine to-morrow.\"\n\nMy mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the\nunpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since\nhis marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment.\nBut I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach\nof me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in\nthe dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on\nordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n\n\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure\nshe shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n\n\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my\ngrandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but\nmanaged to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of\nthought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into\nthe discovery of their finest lines.\n\n\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or\nrather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am\nsure that hers would agree with me.\"\n\nAnd so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not\nto think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that\nevening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I\ntried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really,\nsince I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on\nthoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the\nterrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this\nforeboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not\nallow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it,\nbut only on the condition that they left behind them every element of\nbeauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or\nbeguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can\nlook on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed\nupon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite\nlines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc\nd'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one\nor amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question\nSwann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose\nears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her\nnatural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n\n\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told\nme some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in\nScandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n\n\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time\neither. I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows\nMaubant quite well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about\nhow he gets up his parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard.\nHe is a neighbour of M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice\nbesides.\"\n\n\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt\nC�line in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed\nforced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;\ndarting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann.\nAnd my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was C�line's\nway of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a\nblend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to\nunderline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann\nhis having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was\nembarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n\n\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old\ngentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he\nwill talk for hours on end.\"\n\n\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature\nhad unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for\nbecoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the\nladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his\nparts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters\nwith a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to\ntaste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private\nlife of Mole or of the Comte de Paris.\n\n\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell\nyou has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me\njust now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came\nacross a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused\nyou. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one\nof the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a\njournal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from\nthe devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days,\nmorning, noon and night.\"\n\n\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the\npapers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that\nshe had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_.\n\n\"Yes,\" aunt C�line went one better. \"When they write about things or\npeople in whom we are interested.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I\nfind with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in\nsome fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four\nbooks in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose\nthat, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered\nhands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside\nit--oh! I don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pens�es_?\" He articulated\nthe title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And\nthen, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\"\nhe went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which\nsome men of the world like to affect, \"we should read that the Queen of\nthe Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de L�on had\ngiven a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right\nproportion between 'information' and 'publicity.'\" But at once\nregretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of\nserious matters, he added ironically: \"We are having a most entertaining\nconversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,\" and\nthen, turning to my grandfather: \"Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier\nhad had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he\nsays of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in that coarse bottle anything but\nill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'\"\n\n\"Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very\ndifferent!\" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as\nher sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both.\nC�line began to laugh.\n\nSwann was puzzled, but went on: \"'I cannot say whether it was his\nignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to\nmy children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'\"\n\nMy grandfather was already in ecstasies over \"ignorance or a trap,\"\nbut Miss C�line--the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having\narrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing--had grown\nangry.\n\n\"What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is\nthe point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another?\nWhat difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long\nas he is intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his\nchildren, your Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with\nall honest men. Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote\nit!\"\n\nAnd my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be\nfor him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him\nthe stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: \"Just\ntell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on\nthese occasions. Oh, yes:\n\n\n  What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!\n\nGood, that is, very good.\"\n\nI never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table\nI should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time,\nand that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to\ngive her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my\nroom. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began\nto eat and drink and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand\ninto this kiss, which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in\nexecution, everything that my own efforts could put into it: would\nlook out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where I would\nimprint it, and would so prepare my thoughts that I might be able,\nthanks to these mental preliminaries, to consecrate the whole of the\nminute Mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my\nlips, as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only\nprepares his palette, and from what he remembers and from rough notes\ndoes in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter's\nabsence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my\ngrandfather said with unconscious cruelty: \"The little man looks tired;\nhe'd better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.\"\n\nAnd my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in\nobserving the letter of a treaty, went on: \"Yes, run along; to bed with\nyou.\"\n\nI would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the\ndinner-bell rang.\n\n\"No, no, leave your mother alone. You've said good night quite enough.\nThese exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs.\"\n\nAnd so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the\nstaircase 'against my heart,' as the saying is, climbing in opposition\nto my heart's desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had\nnot, by her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That\nhateful staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out\na smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and\nfixed the special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made\nit perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed\nthis olfactory guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we\nhave gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it\nonly as a little girl whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out\nof the water, or as a line of Moli�re which we repeat incessantly to\nourselves, it is a great relief to wake up, so that our intelligence\ncan disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of\nheroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the precise converse of this relief\nwhich I felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my\nconsciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid, instantaneous almost,\na manner at once insidious and brutal as I breathed in--a far more\npoisonous thing than any moral penetration--the peculiar smell of the\nvarnish upon that staircase.\n\nOnce in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to\ndig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the\nshroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which\nhad been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the\nred curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted\nthe desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother\nbegging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not\nput in writing. My fear was that Fran�oise, my aunt's cook who used to\nbe put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my\nnote. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to\nmy mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly\ninconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre\nto hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might\nor might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant,\nsubtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or\nirrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which\ncombine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast\nwith prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against \"seething the kid\nin his mother's milk,\" or \"eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow\nof the thigh.\" This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy\nwhich she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our\ninstructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and\nrefinements of fashion as nothing in Fran�oise's surroundings or in her\ncareer as a servant in a village household could have put into her head;\nand we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past\nexistence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood,\njust as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still\ntestify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among\ndelicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre\nFils Aymon.\n\nIn this particular instance, the article of her code which made it\nhighly improbable that--barring an outbreak of fire--Fran�oise would\ngo down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a\nperson as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for\nthe family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also\nfor the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have\nfound touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her\nlips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter\nit, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred\ncharacter in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect\nof making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one\nchance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not\nin the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who,\non saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her\nan answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would\ncertainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that\nFran�oise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses\nwere so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs\nimperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that\nwe might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five\nminutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of\nmy handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents,\nor tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter.\nThen she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply:\n\"What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!\"\n\nA moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage\nand that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once,\nin front of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he\nwould find a way of slipping it into Mamma's hand. At once my anxiety\nsubsided; it was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until\nto-morrow that I had lost my mother, for my little line was going--to\nannoy her, no doubt, and doubly so because this contrivance would make\nme ridiculous in Swann's eyes--but was going all the same to admit me,\ninvisibly and by stealth, into the same room as herself, was going\nto whisper from me into her ear; for that forbidden and unfriendly\ndining-room, where but a moment ago the ice itself--with burned nuts in\nit--and the finger-bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that\nwere mischievous and of a mortal sadness because Mamma was tasting of\nthem and I was far away, had opened its doors to me and, like a ripe\nfruit which bursts through its skin, was going to pour out into my\nintoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma's attention while she\nwas reading what I had written. Now I was no longer separated from her;\nthe barriers were down; an exquisite thread was binding us. Besides,\nthat was not all, for surely Mamma would come.\n\nAs for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann\nwould have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had\nguessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due\ncourse, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years,\nand no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so\nwell as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the\ncreature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not\nand cannot follow--to him that anguish came through Love, to which it\nis in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but\nwhen, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one's soul before\nLove has yet entered into one's life, then it must drift, awaiting\nLove's coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the\ndisposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety\nor affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself\napprentice, when Fran�oise returned to tell me that my letter would be\ndelivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can\ngive us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at\nthe house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or\n'first-night' at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside,\ndesperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He\nrecognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there.\nAnd when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his\nrelative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple,\ntakes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five\nminutes. How much we love him--as at that moment I loved Fran�oise--the\ngood-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable,\nhuman, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in\nthe thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and\nseductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman\nwhom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has\naccosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries,\nthen the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible\nand torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown\npleasures--behold, a breach in the wall, and we are through it. Behold,\none of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment\nas genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself\nbecause our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to\nourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created\nit: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting\nthere below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not\nbe essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so\nwell able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that\n\"Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more\namusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there.\" Alas! Swann\nhad learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are\npowerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even\ninto a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind\nfriend comes down again alone.\n\nMy mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my\nself-respect (which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she\nhad asked me to let her know the result of my search for something\nor other) made Fran�oise tell me, in so many words \"There is no\nanswer\"--words I have so often, since then, heard the hall-porters in\n'mansions' and the flunkeys in gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to\nsome poor girl, who replies in bewilderment: \"What! he's said nothing?\nIt's not possible. You did give him my letter, didn't you? Very well,\nI shall wait a little longer.\" And just as she invariably protests that\nshe does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for\nher, and sits on there, hearing nothing further, except an occasional\nremark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger\nwhom he will send off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put some\ncustomer's wine on the ice; so, having declined Fran�oise's offer to\nmake me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go off again to the\nservants' hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried not to hear the\nvoices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden.\n\nBut after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma,\nby approaching--at the risk of making her angry--so near to her that I\nfelt I could reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her\nagain, I had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep\nuntil I actually had seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more\npainfully as I increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm\nand to acquiesce in my ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided,\na feeling of intense happiness coursed through me, as when a strong\nmedicine begins to take effect and one's pain vanishes: I had formed a\nresolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma,\nand had decided to kiss her at all costs, even with the certainty of\nbeing in disgrace with her for long afterwards, when she herself came\nup to bed. The tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely\nalert, no less than my sense of expectation, my thirst for and my fear\nof danger.\n\nNoiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed;\nhardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things\noutside seemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the\nmoonlight which, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the\nextension, forwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its\nsubstance, had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer,\nlike a map which, after being folded up, is spread out upon the ground.\nWhat had to move--a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance--moved. But\nits minute shuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with\nutmost delicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene,\nand yet was not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon\nthis surface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most\ndistant sounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end\nof the town, could be distinguished with such exact 'finish' that the\nimpression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their\n'pianissimo' execution, like those movements on muted strings so well\nperformed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does\nnot lose a single note, one thinks all the same that they are being\nplayed somewhere outside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all\nthe old subscribers, and my grandmother's sisters too, when Swann had\ngiven them his seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught\nthe distant approach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded\nthe corner of the Rue de Tr�vise.\n\nI was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which\nnone could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my\nparents' hands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would\nhave imagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only\nsome really shameful fault. But in the system of education which they\nhad given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of\nother children, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list\n(doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which\nI needed to be more carefully protected) those in which I can now\ndistinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to\na nervous impulse. But such words as these last had never been uttered\nin my hearing; no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way\nwhich might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my\ngiving in to them, or that I was actually incapable of holding out\nagainst them. Yet I could easily recognise this class of transgressions\nby the anguish of mind which preceded, as well as by the rigour of the\npunishment which followed them; and I knew that what I had just done was\nin the same category as certain other sins for which I had been severely\nchastised, though infinitely more serious than they. When I went out to\nmeet my mother as she herself came up to bed, and when she saw that I\nhad remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage,\nI should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer, I should be\npacked off to school next morning; so much was certain. Very good: had\nI been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself out of the window,\nI should still have preferred such a fate. For what I wanted now was\nMamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far along the road\nwhich led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my\nsteps.\n\nI could hear my parents' footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when\nthe rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to\nthe window. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster\ngood, and whether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice.\n\"I thought it rather so-so,\" she was saying; \"next time we shall have to\ntry another flavour.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you,\" said my great-aunt, \"what a change I find in Swann.\nHe is quite antiquated!\" She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann\nalways in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to\nfind him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him.\nAnd the others too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal,\nexcessive, scandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of\nthat class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow\nmust be longer than for other men, since for such a one it is void of\npromise, and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any\nsubsequent partition among his offspring.\n\n\"I fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his, who\n'lives' with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all Combray knows. It's\nthe talk of the town.\"\n\nMy mother observed that, in spite of this, he had looked much less\nunhappy of late. \"And he doesn't nearly so often do that trick of his,\nso like his father, of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his\nforehead. I think myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn't love his\nwife any more.\"\n\n\"Why, of course he doesn't,\" answered my grandfather. \"He wrote me a\nletter about it, ages ago, to which I took care to pay no attention, but\nit left no doubt as to his feelings, let alone his love for his wife.\nHullo! you two; you never thanked him for the Asti!\" he went on, turning\nto his sisters-in-law.\n\n\"What! we never thanked him? I think, between you and me, that I put it\nto him quite neatly,\" replied my aunt Flora.\n\n\"Yes, you managed it very well; I admired you for it,\" said my aunt\nC�line.\n\n\"But you did it very prettily, too.\"\n\n\"Yes; I liked my expression about 'nice neighbours.'\"\n\n\"What! Do you call that thanking him?\" shouted my grandfather. \"I heard\nthat all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann.\nYou may be quite sure he never noticed it.\"\n\n\"Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the\ncompliment. You didn't expect me to tell him the number of bottles, or\nto guess what he paid for them.\"\n\nMy father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my\nfather said: \"Well, shall we go up to bed?\"\n\n\"As you wish, dear, though I don't feel in the least like sleeping. I\ndon't know why; it can't be the coffee-ice--it wasn't strong enough to\nkeep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants' hall: poor\nFran�oise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me\nwhile you go and undress.\"\n\nMy mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the\nstaircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I\nwent quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I\ncould hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety,\nbut with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light\ncoming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw\nmyself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not\nrealising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression\nof anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used\nto go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences\nthan this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that\nfurther intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility,\nand that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as\nindicating that, with such a punishment as was in store for me, mere\nsilence, and even anger, were relatively puerile.\n\nA word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one\nconverses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice;\nthe kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which\nwould have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being\nangry with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the\ndressing-room, where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid\nthe 'scene' which he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice\nhalf-stifled by her anger: \"Run away at once. Don't let your father see\nyou standing there like a crazy jane!\"\n\nBut I begged her again to \"Come and say good night to me!\" terrified as\nI saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall,\nbut also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope\nthat my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must\nif she continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: \"Go back to\nyour room. I will come.\"\n\nToo late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one\nheard me, \"I am done for!\"\n\nI was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do\nthings which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters\ngranted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to\n'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as\n'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at\nall, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular\nwalk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of\nit was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening,\nlong before the appointed hour he would snap out: \"Run along up to\nbed now; no excuses!\" But then again, simply because he was devoid\nof principles (in my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly\nspeaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air\nof annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without\nsome embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: \"Go along with him,\nthen; you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his\nroom for a little. I don't need anything.\"\n\n\"But dear,\" my mother answered timidly, \"whether or not I feel like\nsleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...\"\n\n\"There's no question of making him accustomed,\" said my father, with\na shrug of the shoulders; \"you can see quite well that the child is\nunhappy. After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill,\nand a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell\nFran�oise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the\nrest of the night. I'm off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you.\nGood night.\"\n\nIt was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my\nsentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring\nto move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white\nnightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere\nin which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up\nhis head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli\nwhich M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself\naway from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of\nthe staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually\nclimb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have\nperished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have\narisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days\nI could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of\ncomprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able\nto tell Mamma to \"Go with the child.\" Never again will such hours be\npossible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if\nI listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to\ncontrol in my father's presence, and which broke out only when I found\nmyself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is\nonly because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that\nI hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively\ndrowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would\nsuppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again\nthrough the silent evening air.\n\nMamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so\ndeadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents\ngave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the\nreward of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in\nthis crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat\narbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him\nand due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance\nexpediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what\nI called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that\ntitle less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his\nnature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own,\nhad probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was\nevery evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but\nthey loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering,\nwhich they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous\nsensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection\nfor me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much\ncourage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he\nhad said to my mother: \"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in\nmy room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination\nthose hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to\nexpect; for when Fran�oise (who guessed that something extraordinary\nmust have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my\nhand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: \"But, Madame, what is\nlittle Master crying for?\" she replied: \"Why, Fran�oise, he doesn't know\nhimself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then\ngo off to your own.\" And thus for the first time my unhappiness was\nregarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as\nan involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous\ncondition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation\nthat I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness\nof my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small\ndegree of pride, either, in Fran�oise presence at this return to humane\nconditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my\nroom and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised\nme to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort\nof puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to have\nbeen happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a first\nconcession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first step\ndown from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first time\nshe, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck\nme that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had\nsucceeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in\nrelaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened\na new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared\nnow, I should have said to Mamma: \"No, I don't want you; you mustn't\nsleep here.\" But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what\nwould be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent\nidealism of my grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief\nwas done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of\nher company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's\nbeautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she\nsat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for\nthat reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her\nanger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness\nwhich my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and\nsecret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first\nwhite hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then\nI saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length\nof tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to\nstruggle to keep back her own. Then, as she saw that I had noticed\nthis, she said to me, with a smile: \"Why, my little buttercup, my little\ncanary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly as himself if this goes\non. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't either, we mustn't\ngo on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll get one of your\nbooks.\" But I had none there. \"Would you like me to get out the books\nnow that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday? Just\nthink it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is nothing new\nfor you then.\"\n\nI was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books\nin which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was\nwrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this\nfirst glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already\nthe paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year\nbefore. It contained _La Mare au Diable_, _Fran�ois le Champi_, _La\nPetite Fadette_, and _Les Ma�tres Sonneurs_. My grandmother, as I\nlearned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of\nRousseau, and _Indiana_; for while she considered light reading as\nunwholesome as sweets and cakes, she did not reflect that the strong\nbreath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence\nat once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and\ncountry breezes upon his body. But when my father had seemed almost to\nregard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed\nto give me, she had journeyed back by herself to Jouy-le-Vicomte to\nthe bookseller's, so that there should be no fear of my not having my\npresent in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come home so\nunwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again\nto tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four\npastoral novels of George Sand.\n\n\"My dear,\" she had said to Mamma, \"I could not allow myself to give the\nchild anything that was not well written.\"\n\nThe truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything\nfrom which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all,\nthat profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our\npleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth.\nEven when she had to make some one a present of the kind called\n'useful,' when she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or\na walking-stick, she would choose 'antiques,' as though their long\ndesuetude had effaced from them any semblance of utility and fitted\nthem rather to instruct us in the lives of the men of other days than\nto serve the common requirements of our own. She would have liked me to\nhave in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places.\nBut at the moment of buying them, and for all that the subject of the\npicture had an aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity\nand utility had too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical\nnature of their reproduction by photography. She attempted by a\nsubterfuge, if not to eliminate altogether their commercial banality,\nat least to minimise it, to substitute for the bulk of it what was\nart still, to introduce, as it might be, several 'thicknesses' of\nart; instead of photographs of Chartres Cathedral, of the Fountains\nof Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would inquire of Swann whether some\ngreat painter had not made pictures of them, and preferred to give me\nphotographs of 'Chartres Cathedral' after Corot, of the 'Fountains of\nSaint-Cloud' after Hubert Robert, and of 'Vesuvius' after Turner, which\nwere a stage higher in the scale of art. But although the photographer\nhad been prevented from reproducing directly the masterpieces or the\nbeauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a great artist, he\nresumed his odious position when it came to reproducing the artist's\ninterpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with vulgarity,\nmy grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still\nfurther. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been engraved,\npreferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of\nassociation apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a\nmasterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as\nMorghen's print of the 'Cenacolo' of Leonardo before it was spoiled\nby restoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of\ninterpreting the art of making presents were not always happy. The idea\nwhich I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to\nhave the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than\nwhat I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no\nlonger keep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an\nindictment of my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented\nto married couples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down\nupon them had at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient.\nBut my grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too\nclosely with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still\nbe discerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And\neven what in such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a\nmanner to which we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as\none of those old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a\nmetaphor whose fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our\nmodern tongue. In precisely the same way the pastoral novels of George\nSand, which she was giving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms\nof antique furniture, full of expressions that have fallen out of use\nand returned as imagery, such as one finds now only in country dialects.\nAnd my grandmother had bought them in preference to other books, just as\nshe would have preferred to take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or\nsome other such piece of antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on\nthe mind, filling it with a nostalgic longing for impossible journeys\nthrough the realms of time.\n\nMamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen _Fran�ois le Champi_, whose\nreddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality\nin my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real\nnovels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist.\nThat prepared me in advance to imagine that _Fran�ois le Champi_\ncontained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the\nnarrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain\nmodes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with\na little experience, he may recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed\nto me then distinctive--for to me a new book was not one of a number of\nsimilar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no\ncause of existence beyond himself--an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar\nessence of _Fran�ois le Champi_. Beneath the everyday incidents, the\ncommonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an\nintonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began:\nto me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read\nto myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something\nquite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge\nof the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was\nreading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd\nchanges which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and\nthe boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain,\nseemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I\ncould readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of\n_Champi_, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own\nbright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful\nreader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which\nshe found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her\ninterpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was\nthe same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and\nwomen whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe\nwith what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from\nher whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed\nsome mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an\nevent or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the\nburden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some\nyoung man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George\nSand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral\ndistinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above\nall other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until\nmuch later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other\nqualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any\nweakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that\npowerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness,\nall the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed\nto have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak,\nwithin her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required,\nwith the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated\nthem, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these\nmeans she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be\nor discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the\npreterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the\nmelancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing\nto an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now\nslackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their\ndifference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this\nquite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling.\n\nMy agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this\ngentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a\nnight could not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the\nworld, namely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of\ndarkness, ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes\nof others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to\nbe anything but a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should\nagain be the victim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But\nwhen these storms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise\ntheir existence; besides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off;\nI reminded myself that I should still have time to think about things,\nalbeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power, albeit\nthe coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will,\nand seemed not quite inevitable only because it was still separated from\nme by this short interval.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at\nnight and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than\nthis sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy\nbackground, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign\nwill illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other\nparts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the\nlittle parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along\nwhich would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the\nhall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase,\nso hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering\n'elevation' of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom,\nwith the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter;\nin a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all\nits possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy\nbackground, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting\none sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in\nthe provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had\nconsisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though\nthere had been no time there but seven o'clock at night. I must own\nthat I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other\nscenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts\nwhich I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an\nexercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures\nwhich that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of\nthe past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this\nresidue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead.\n\nPermanently dead? Very possibly.\n\nThere is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second\nhazard, that of our own death, often prevents us from awaiting for any\nlength of time the favours of the first.\n\nI feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the\nsouls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior\nbeing, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and so\neffectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we\nhappen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which\nforms their prison. Then they start and tremble, they call us by our\nname, and as soon as we have recognised their voice the spell is broken.\nWe have delivered them: they have overcome death and return to share our\nlife.\n\nAnd so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to\nrecapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile.\nThe past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of\nintellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material\nobject will give us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object,\nit depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves\nmust die.\n\nMany years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was\ncomprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had\nany existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my\nmother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did\nnot ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular\nreason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump\nlittle cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they\nhad been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell. And soon,\nmechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing\nmorrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked\na morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with\nit, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I\nstopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place.\nAn exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached,\nwith no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life\nhad become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity\nillusory--this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has\nof filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not\nin me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental,\nmortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was\nconscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that\nit infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the\nsame nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How\ncould I seize upon and define it?\n\nI drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the\nfirst, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time\nto stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object\nof my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has\ncalled up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat\nindefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which\nI, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon\nthe tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my\ndisposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my\nown mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss\nof uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed\nbeyond its own borders; when it, the seeker, is at once the dark region\nthrough which it must go seeking, where all its equipment will avail it\nnothing. Seek? More than that: create. It is face to face with something\nwhich does not so far exist, to which it alone can give reality and\nsubstance, which it alone can bring into the light of day.\n\nAnd I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this\nunremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its\nexistence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a\nreal state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and\nvanished. I decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts\nto the moment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again\nthe same state, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make\none further effort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting\nsensation. And that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out\nevery obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all\nattention to the sounds which come from the next room. And then, feeling\nthat my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report,\nI compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which I have just\ndenied it, to think of other things, to rest and refresh itself before\nthe supreme attempt. And then for the second time I clear an empty\nspace in front of it. I place in position before my mind's eye the still\nrecent taste of that first mouthful, and I feel something start within\nme, something that leaves its resting-place and attempts to rise,\nsomething that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth; I\ndo not know yet what it is, but I can feel it mounting slowly; I can\nmeasure the resistance, I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed.\n\nUndoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must\nbe the image, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has\ntried to follow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too\nfar off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless\nreflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of\nradiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as\nthe one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its\ncontemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea;\ncannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of\nwhat period in my past life.\n\nWill it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this\nmemory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment\nhas travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the\nvery depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has\nstopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who\ncan say whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task,\nmust lean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which\ndeters us from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has\nurged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely\nof the worries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let\nthemselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind.\n\nAnd suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb\nof madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those\nmornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good\nday to her in her bedroom, my aunt L�onie used to give me, dipping it\nfirst in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the\nlittle madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it;\nperhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without\ntasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image\nhad dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among\nothers more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned\nand put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the\nforms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry,\nso richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either\nobliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of\nexpansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my\nconsciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after\nthe people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still,\nalone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more\npersistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a\nlong time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their\nmoment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the\ntiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of\nrecollection.\n\nAnd once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in\nher decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I\ndid not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory\nmade me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where\nher room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to\nthe little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out\nbehind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had\nbeen all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to\nnight and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon,\nthe streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took\nwhen it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling\na porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper\nwhich until then are without character or form, but, the moment they\nbecome wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive\nshape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable,\nso in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park,\nand the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and\ntheir little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray\nand of its surroundings, taking their proper shapes and growing solid,\nsprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMBRAY\n\nCombray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it\nfrom the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no\nmore than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it\nand for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about\nits long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as\na shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking\nhouses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and\nthere, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town\nin a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing,\nlike its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the\ncountry, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected\nlong shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun\nbegan to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows;\nstreets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured\nin the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue\nSaint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood,\nthe Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue\ndu Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these\nCombray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in\ncolours so different from those in which the world is decked for me\nto-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered\nabove them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the\nprojections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able\nto cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de\nl'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch�, from whose windows\nin the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in\nmy mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to\nsecure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural\nthan it would be to make Golo's acquaintance and to chat with Genevi�ve\nde Brabant.\n\nMy grandfather's cousin--by courtesy my great-aunt--with whom we used\nto stay, was the mother of that aunt L�onie who, since her husband's (my\nuncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray,\nthen her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed;\nand who now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite\ncondition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions,\nand religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue\nSaint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pr� (as\ndistinct from the Petit-Pr�, a green space in the centre of the town\nwhere three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three\nhigh steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a\ndeep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of\nstone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life\nwas now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she\nwould rest in the afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms\nof that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of\nair or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which\nwe cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours\nspringing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret\nsystem of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which\ntheir atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and\ncoloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside,\nbut already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful,\nlimpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left\nthe orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but\nplenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar\nfrost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as\na village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which\nbrings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as\na deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst\nwithout having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated\nwith the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I\ncould not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on\nthose first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could\ntaste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before\nI went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time\nin the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to\nwarm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides\nand plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot,\nmaking the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in\nthe country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under\nwhich one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or\nsnowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of\nshelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to\nand fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each\none always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking\nlike a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room, was\nthickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had\nalready 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed them and glazed them and\nfluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable\ncountry cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour\nthe crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells\nof the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper\nI always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the\nnondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the\nflowered quilt.\n\nIn the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She\nnever spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was\nsomething broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might\ndisplace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when\nalone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good\nfor her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it\nwould make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she\nwas liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she\nattached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance,\nendowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to\nkeep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate\nthem, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue\nwhich was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the\nhabit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there\nwas no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying\nto herself: \"I must not forget that I never slept a wink\"--for \"never\nsleeping a wink\" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted\nand respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Fran�oise\nwould not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day,\nwhen my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished\nto 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot\nherself as to say \"what made me wake up,\" or \"I dreamed that,\" she would\nflush and at once correct herself.\n\nAfter waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Fran�oise would\nbe making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask\ninstead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of\nthe chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom\nrequired for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had\ntwisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale\nflowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping\nthem in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered\ntheir own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous\nthings imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank\nsides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded,\nor interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A\nthousand trifling little details--the charming prodigality of the\nchemist--details which would have been eliminated from an artificial\npreparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the\nname of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were\nindeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the\ntrain, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not\nimitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each\nnew character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these\nlittle grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but\nbeyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms\namong the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden\nroses--marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place\nof a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree\nwhich had and those which had not been 'in bloom'--shewed me that these\nwere petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package\nhad embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still\ntheir colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life\nwhich was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower.\nPresently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she\nwould relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of\nwhich she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.\n\nAt one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of\nlemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as\nhigh altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of\nVichy-C�lestins, might be found her service-books and her medical\nprescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed,\nof her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and\nfor vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she\nhad the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to\nnight to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily\nbut immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail\nafterwards with Fran�oise.\n\nI would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me\naway in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad\nbrow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet\nhave arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the\npoints of a crown of thorns--or the beads of a rosary, and she would say\nto me: \"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for\nmass; and if you see Fran�oise downstairs, tell her not to stay too\nlong amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want\nanything.\"\n\nFran�oise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not\nat that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to\nours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we\nspent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went\nto Combray, and when my aunt L�onie used still to spend the winter in\nParis with her mother, a time when I knew Fran�oise so little that on\nNew Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put\na five-franc piece in my hand and said: \"Now, be careful. Don't make\nany mistake. Wait until you hear me say 'Good morning, Fran�oise,' and\nI touch your arm before you give it to her.\" No sooner had we arrived\nin my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a\nsnowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the\nconcentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Fran�oise,\nmotionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like\nthe statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to\nthis religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested\nlove of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper\nclasses' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the\nhope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said\nin a loud voice: \"Good morning, Fran�oise.\" At this signal my fingers\nparted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused\nbut outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was\nno one I knew better than Fran�oise. We were her favourites, and in the\nfirst years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us\nas for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in\naddition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those\ninvisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a\nfamily as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not\nbeing her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome\nus, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us,\non the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an\nicy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and\nif her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of\nhim, and whether he took after his granny.\n\nLater, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Fran�oise\nwas still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would\nspeak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and\ntheir lives.\n\nShe had guessed that Fran�oise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and\nthat he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the\ntwo could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when\nFran�oise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said\nto her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Fran�oise, if Julien has had to go away,\nand you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but\nwill make the best of it, won't you?\"\n\nAnd Fran�oise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame\nis worse than the X-rays\" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation\nof difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered\nwoman's, daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme.\nOctave, which see what is in your heart\"--and she went off, disturbed\nthat anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should\nnot see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the\npleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys\nand sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or\npleasure to some one other than herself.\n\nMy aunt resigned herself to doing without Fran�oise to some extent\nduring our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services\nof so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five\no'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and\ndazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for\nchurchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a\nhorse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the\nappearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when\nMamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually\nboiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least\nsatisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take\nno pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention,\nknowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease\nto be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it;\nwho, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and\nmistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not\nlook for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability,\nwhich may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter\nbarrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the\nleast trace of individuality.\n\nWhen Fran�oise, having seen that my parents had everything they\nrequired, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to\nfind out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings\npased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an\nexplanation, in regard to some important event.\n\n\"Just fancy, Fran�oise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an\nhour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I\nshould not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.\"\n\n\"Well, there'd be nothing wonderful in that,\" would be the answer. Or:\n\n\"Fran�oise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen\nMme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother\nCallot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You\nknow you've been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you\nmight be able to get some like these for our visitors.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be surprised if they came from the Cur�'s,\" Fran�oise would\nsay, and:\n\n\"I'm sure you wouldn't, my poor Fran�oise,\" my aunt would reply, raising\nher shoulders. \"From the Cur�'s, indeed! You know quite well that he\ncan never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not\nasparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not\nyour arm, of course, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner\nagain this year.\" Or:\n\n\"Fran�oise, didn't you hear that bell just now! It split my head.\"\n\n\"No, Mme. Octave.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for\nthat. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her\nat once and they went off along the Rue de l'Oiseau. There must be some\nchild ill.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!\" would come with a sigh from\nFran�oise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown\nto her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to\nlament. Or:\n\n\"Fran�oise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear,\nof course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had\nforgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the\nLord called me home too; I don't know what has become of my head since I\nlost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.\"\n\n\"Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our\ntime didn't sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn't\ngone out.\"\n\nIn this way Fran�oise and my aunt made a critical valuation between\nthem, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest\nhappenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so\nmysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait\nuntil it was time for Fran�oise to come upstairs, and then a formidable\nand quadruple peal would resound through the house.\n\n\"But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,\" Fran�oise would\nbegin. \"Are you feeling faint?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, Fran�oise,\" my aunt would reply, \"that is to say, yes;\nfor you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don't feel\nfaint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where\nI am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just\nseen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn't\nknow at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It's not often\nthat Th�odore can't tell you who a person is.\"\n\n\"But that must be M. Pupin's daughter,\" Fran�oise would say, preferring\nto stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice\nalready into Camus's shop that morning.\n\n\"M. Pupin's daughter! Oh, that's a likely story, my poor Fran�oise. Do\nyou think I should not have recognised M. Pupin's daughter!\"\n\n\"But I don't mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he\none who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's what it is!\" my aunt would say, \"she must have come over\nfor the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come\nover for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come\nalong and ring her sister's door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be\nit! I saw the boy from Galopin's go by with a tart. You will see that\nthe tart was for Mme. Goupil.\"\n\n\"Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won't be\nlong in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it's\nnot so early as it was,\" would be the answer, for Fran�oise, who was\nanxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry\nto leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction.\n\n\"Oh! not before midday!\" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation,\ndarting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let\nit be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a\nkeen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to\nluncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still\nbefore enjoying the spectacle. \"And it will come in the middle of\nmy luncheon!\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a\ndistraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the\nsame time. \"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on\none of the flat plates?\" These were the only plates which had pictures\non them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the\ndescription on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would\nput on her spectacles and spell out: \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\"\n\"Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,\" and smile, and say \"Very good indeed.\"\n\n\"I may as well go across to Camus...\" Fran�oise would hazard, seeing\nthat my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.\n\n\"No, no; it's not worth while now; it's certain to be the Pupin girl. My\npoor Fran�oise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.\"\n\nBut it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for\nFran�oise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was\nas incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be\nforgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the\nRue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena,\ncareful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous\nmonster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either\npersonally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more\nor less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to\nbe Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abb� Perdreau's\nniece come home from her convent, or the Cur�'s brother, a tax-collector\nat Ch�teaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to\nCombray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed\nby the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't\nknow at all,' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify\nthem at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Cur� had given\nwarning that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I\ncame in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if\nI was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux,\na man whom my grandfather didn't know:\n\n\"A man grandfather didn't know at all!\" she would exclaim. \"That's a\nlikely story.\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by\nthe news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my\ngrandfather would be summoned. \"Who can it have been that you passed\nnear the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn't know at all?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I did,\" my grandfather would answer; \"it was Prosper,\nMme. Bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother.\"\n\n\"Ah, well!\" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still;\n\"and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!\"\nAfter which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not\nto upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known\nin Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to\nsee a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it\nincessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem\nall her inductive talent and her leisure hours.\n\n\"That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,\" Fran�oise would suggest, without any\nreal conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should\nnot 'split her head.'\n\n\"As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!\"--for my aunt's critical mind\nwould not so easily admit any fresh fact.\n\n\"Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from\nLisieux.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's what it is!\"\n\n\"It seems, it's a most engaging animal,\" Fran�oise would go on, having\ngot the story from Th�odore, \"as clever as a Christian, always in a good\ntemper, always friendly, always everything that's nice. It's not often\nyou see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it's high\ntime I left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's\nnearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress\nthe asparagus.\"\n\n\"What, Fran�oise, more asparagus! It's a regular disease of asparagus\nyou have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.\"\n\n\"No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They'll be coming back\nfrom church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won't eat it out of the\nback of their spoons, you'll see.\"\n\n\"Church! why, they must be there now; you'd better not lose any time. Go\nand look after your luncheon.\"\n\nWhile my aunt gossiped on in this way with Fran�oise I would have\naccompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it\nstill, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black,\nand full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply\nfurrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led\nus) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women\ngoing into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had\nmanaged by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress\nitself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels\nupon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its\nmemorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray,\nwho were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual\npavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time\nhad softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey\nand flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky,\nfrothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning\nthe white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their\nlimits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription,\nbringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed\ncharacters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest\nwere disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant\nas on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside\nyou might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was\nfilled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a\nplaying-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between\nearth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on\nweekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those\nrare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more\nluxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to\nhave almost a habitable air, like the hall--all sculptured stone and\npainted glass--of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat\nkneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly\ncorded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's\nand was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy\nsnow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the\nwindow also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like\na pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined\nby a sunrise--the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the\naltar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for\na moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished\nthan painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them\nwere so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity\nsparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare\nbrilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There\nwas one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little\nrectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience\nof the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a\nray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision\nhad drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled\nby turns, a rare and transient fire--the next instant it had taken on\nall the iridescence of a peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a\nflaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of\nthe dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were\nalong the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was\nfollowing my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped\nin their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the\ndeep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on\nsome enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished,\ndearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which\ncould be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in\nwhich it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the\nstraw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came\ndown before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness\nof the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime\nin old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded\ncarpet of forget-me-nots in glass.\n\nTwo tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in\nwhich tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the\nfeatures of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of\nGuermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one\nanother, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch\nof red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the\nyellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have\nacquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding\natmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk\nand wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite 'gone' at the\ntop, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing\nupper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong\nrays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these,\nthe treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me\nwere almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was\nsaid, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons\nof Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of\nwhich I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way\nto our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with\namazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little\npeople's supernatural passage--all these things made of the church for\nme something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building\nwhich occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space--the name of the\nfourth being Time--which had sailed the centuries with that old nave,\nwhere bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across\nand hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each\nsuccessive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant,\nhiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness\nof its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches,\nlong stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where,\nnear the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the\ntower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful\ngothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up\nsisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves\nsmilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger\nbrother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked\ndown upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting\ndown with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through\nwhich, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault,\nribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone, Th�odore or his\nsister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's little\ndaughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been\nbored, or so it was said, \"by a crystal lamp which, on the night when\nthe Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the\ngolden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and\nwith neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried\nitself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.\"\n\nAnd then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so\ncoarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From\noutside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower\nlevel, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced\nashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing\nparticularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at\nan abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall\nrather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall\nall the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to\ncompare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day,\nturning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three\nalley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn,\ncrumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead\nand the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that\nmoment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at\nRheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in\nits construction, but instinctively I exclaimed \"The Church!\"\n\nThe church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue\nSaint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours,\nMme. Loiseau's house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its\nwalls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might\nhave had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne\nnumbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on\nhis morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau's and after leaving\nM. Rapin's, there existed, for all that, between the church and\neverything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of\ndemarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind.\nIn vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which\ndeveloped the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times\nand in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more\nimportant business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life,\nthan to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark\nfront of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at\nall; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they\nleaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the\nimpression of an abyss.\n\nFrom a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of\nSaint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath\nwhich Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought\nus down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it\nslipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering\ncontinually in all directions, he would say: \"Come, get your wraps\ntogether, we are there.\" And on one of the longest walks we ever took\nfrom Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly\non to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over\nwhich rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple,\nbut so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched\non the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a\nlandscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this\nsingle indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make\nout the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by\nits side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first\nof all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty\nmorning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the\nviolet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the\ncolour of the wild vine.\n\nOften in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop\nto look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair\nabove another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing\nto which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released,\nit let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little\nwhile would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed\nthem to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden\nuninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had\nstruck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the\nviolet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return\nand be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some\nperching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and\nswallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull\nperches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without\nquite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire\nthat absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her\nlove--and deem rich in beneficent influences--nature itself, when the\nhand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and\nthe works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church\nserved to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of\ngeneral feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that\nthe church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its\nindividual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for\nthe church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in\nthe steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the\nworld, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of\narchitecture, she would say:\n\n\"My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful,\nbut there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it\ncould play the piano, I am sure it would really _play_.\" And when she\ngazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent\ninclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like\nhands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the\noutpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it;\nher lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old\nstones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost\npinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight\nand were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly\nfar higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks\ninto falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.\n\nIt was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and\nconsecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view\nin the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its\nbase, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I\nsaw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun\nI would say to myself: \"Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for\nmass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt L�onie first,\"\nand I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the\nSquare, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind\nthe blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way\nto mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a\nhandkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see\nwhat he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready\nfor shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday\ncoat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes\nand even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an\nair of enterprise, cunning, and success.\n\nAnd again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Th�odore to bring a\nlarger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the\nfine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of\nus the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still\nof 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked\nits sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from\nmy walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night\nto my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly,\nthere at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a\nbrown velvet cushion, against--as being thrust into the pallid sky which\nhad yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room\nfor it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of\nthe birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence,\nto elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality\nbeyond the power of words.\n\nEven when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it\ncould not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with\nreference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there,\namong the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared\nthus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which\nlook best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of\nhousetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art\nthan those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never\nforget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming\neighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons,\nbetween which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which\ndescends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself\nhidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and\ncompleting their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so\nberinged, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more\na part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side\nby side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple,\ncrinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with\nglossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I\nknow a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even\na third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell,\nsometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the\natmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact,\nnothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this\nview of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But\nsince into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my\nmemory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to\ncontribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not\nmerely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature\nwithout parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole\nsection of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the\nsteeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw\nit at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office,\nsome doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its\nisolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in\nand ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it\nran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it\nwould be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing\nfurther afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in\nprofile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some\nunknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the\napse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed\nto spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its\nspire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that\none must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up\nthe houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger\nof God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of\nhuman bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with\nthem. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter\nof Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on\nthe right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of\na hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical\ncap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only\nfind in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and\nthe passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone\nastray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I\nhad planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing\nstill on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless,\ntrying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed\nfrom the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it\nagain; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now,\nI asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a\ncorner... but... the goal is in my heart...\n\nOn our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who,\ndetained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could\nonly (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray\nbetween Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class\nof men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have\nproved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different\nkind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the\nspecialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation\nprofits. More 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware\nat this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer,\nand so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer\nhad set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease\nin execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are\nobliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they\nbring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or\na sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious.\nTall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair\nmoustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost\nexaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard;\nhe was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an\nexample, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest\nand most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for\nspeaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using\na vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavalli�re neckties, his\nshort, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at\nthe furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy,\nat fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'--\"undoubtedly,\" he would say,\n\"the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for\nwhich there is no forgiveness.\"\n\nWorldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable\nof feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to\napply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not\nvery good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country\ngentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such\nviolent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution\nfor not having guillotined them all.\n\n\"Well met, my friends!\" he would say as he came towards us. \"You are\nlucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris,\nto squeeze back into my niche.\n\n\"Oh, I admit,\" he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical,\ndisillusioned and vague, \"I have every useless thing in the world in\nmy house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great\npatch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above\nyour life, little boy,\" he added, turning to me. \"You have a soul in\nyou of rare quality, an artist's nature; never let it starve for lack of\nwhat it needs.\"\n\nWhen, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether\nMme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform\nher. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was\na painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the\nBad. Fran�oise was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned\nempty-handed owing to the absence of Th�odore, whose dual profession of\nchoirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's\nassistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but\nan encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.\n\n\"Ah!\" my aunt would sigh, \"I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She\nis really the only person who will be able to tell me.\"\n\nEulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after\nthe death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service\nfrom her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from\nwhich she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service,\nor, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give\nTh�odore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons\nlike my aunt L�onie, to whom she would relate everything that had\noccurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional\npocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family\nof her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Cur�'s\nlinen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of\nCombray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that\nseemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the\nskin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red\ncolour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life\nof my aunt L�onie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend\nCur�. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from\nher list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes,\nof falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most\ndetested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid\nherself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much\ncare of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no\noutward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting\nsmile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good\nred beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips\nof Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine\nbottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who\nappeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought,\nin fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those\nwhom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation\nand at Fran�oise urgent request, and who in the course of their visit\nhad shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them\nby venturing a timid: \"Don't you think that if you were just to stir out\na little on really fine days...?\" or who, on the other hand, when she\nsaid to them: \"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!\"\nhad replied: \"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may\nlast a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors\nwould never open to them again. And if Fran�oise was amused by the look\nof consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any\nof these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were\ncoming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far\nmore heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never\nfailed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture\nwhen they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled\nwith secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior\nto all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to\nsee them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that\nwhoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate\nwith her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n\nIn all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in\na minute: \"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\", twenty times\nEulalie would retort with: \"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme.\nOctave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only\nyesterday.\" For one of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the\nformidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled\nwas powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme.\nSazerin.\n\n\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\" my aunt would say, for she\npreferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.\n\nAnd since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to\ndistract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place\nregularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent\nthem, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on\nthose days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with,\nbut at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if\nEulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the\nrapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never\ncease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of\nher symptoms in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door\nat the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would\nalmost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of\nnothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended\nFran�oise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that\nshe might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But--and this more than ever\nfrom the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray--the\nproud hour �f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which\nit blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown,\nwould long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which\ntoo had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still\nbe found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down\nby the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon\nthe permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and\nbiscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us,\nFran�oise would add--as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest\nof the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and\nher own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare,\nlike the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals\nin the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the\nseasons and the incidents of human life--a brill, because the fish-woman\nhad guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty\nin the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she\nhad never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton,\nbecause the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time\nfor it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach,\nby way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get;\ngooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left;\nraspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first\nto come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two\nyears; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an\nalmond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy\nloaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all\nthese had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but\ndedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such\nthings, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the\nhand of Fran�oise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an\n'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her\ntalent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I\nhave finished; I am not hungry,\" would at once have been lowered to the\nlevel of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one\nof his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value\nis the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the\ntiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to\nrise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played,\nand under the composer's-very eyes.\n\nAt length my mother would say to me: \"Now, don't stay here all day;\nyou can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little\nfresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food.\"\n\nAnd I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented\nhere and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled\nupon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender,\nallegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a\nlilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by\na service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected\nsoil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and\napparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see\nits red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the\ncave of Fran�oise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing\nwith the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come\nsometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of\ntheir fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a\ndove.\n\nIn earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which\nsurrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would\nsteal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of\nmy grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a\nmajor, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its\nopened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun\nwhich seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and\nyet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned\nkind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one\ngoes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into\nmy uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account\nof a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault,\nand in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris,\nI used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon,\nwearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a\nworking-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain\nthat I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being\nneglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would\ncross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted,\nwhose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted\nblue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as\nat my grandparents', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his\n'study,' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against\na dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing\nupon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular\nunder the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about\nthem that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and\nwhich now people are beginning to collect again for one single and\nconsistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely,\nthat they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my\nuncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him\nat what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost\nin meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to\ndisturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his\nanswer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of\nhesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: \"A quarter past\ntwo,\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing\nthem: \"A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....\"\n\nAt this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of\nnecessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and\nso incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be\nenjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked,\nas into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for\nhimself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles\npresented to the rest of the audience individually.\n\nEvery morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays\nit announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the\ndreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took\ntheir form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the\ntitle of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and\nwrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless\nit were such strange titles as the _Testament de C�sar Girodot, or\nOedipe-Roi_, inscribed not on the green bills of the Op�ra-Comique, but\non the wine-coloured bills of the Com�die-Fran�aise, nothing seemed\nto me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of\nthe _Diamants de la Couronne_ than the sleek, mysterious satin of the\n_Domino Noir_; and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit\nto the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I\nwould study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title\nof the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to\nsnatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to\ncompare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the\nend I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on\nthe one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle,\nvelvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I\nshould prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to\nchoose between _rice � l'Imp�ratrice_ and the famous cream of chocolate.\n\nAll my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art,\nalthough as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its\nnumberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its\nenjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and\nanother's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an\nincalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would\narrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to\nmurmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified\nin my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.\n\nAnd later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the\nmaster's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would\nalways begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres,\nand if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second\nDelaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron,\nor Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of\nCoquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in\nwhich it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which\nthe name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip\ndown to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of\nbradding and blossoming life.\n\nBut if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of\nMaubant, coming out one afternoon from the Th��tre-Fran�ais, had plunged\nme in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the\nname of a 'star,' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more,\nseen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the\nhair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who,\nI would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting\ndisturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her\nprivate life.\n\nI classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah\nBernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was\ninterested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and\nalso ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses\nin my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to\nsee him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies\nmight come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least\nthought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who\nhad perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding\ntitles were probably no more than _noms de guerre_) the compliment of\npresenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some\nof our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with\nmy grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in\nconversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother:\n\"One of your uncle's friends,\" and I would think of the weary novitiate\nthrough which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real\nimportance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such\nlady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter\ndrive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little\njackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in\nhis own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for\nhim an intimate friend.\n\nAnd so--on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been\naltered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than\nonce prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my\nuncle--one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I\ntook advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier\nthan usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on\ntheir column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied,\nI ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and\npair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's\nbuttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a\nwoman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of\nshutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and\nsaid that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he\nwent in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard\nbefore said: \"Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be\nso amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother\n(your niece, isn't she?) beside it? The image of her, isn't he? I should\nso like to see the little chap, just for a second.\"\n\nI could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the\nmanservant told me to come in.\n\nOn the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my\nuncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him,\nin a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat,\nsat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty\nwhether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush,\nand not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be\nobliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked\nat me and smiled; my uncle said \"My nephew!\" without telling her my name\nor telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with\nmy grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any\nassociation of his family with this other class of acquaintance.\n\n\"How like his mother he is,\" said the lady.\n\n\"But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,\" my uncle\nbroke in quickly, with a note of anger.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year\nwhen you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your\nstaircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she\nwas. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,\" she\nwent on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her\nforehead. \"Tell me,\" she asked my uncle, \"is your niece Mme.----; is her\nname the same as yours?\"\n\n\"He takes most after his father,\" muttered my uncle, who was no more\nanxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma's name\naloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. \"He's his father all\nover, and also like my poor mother.\"\n\n\"I have not met his father, dear,\" said the lady in pink, bowing her\nhead slightly, \"and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it\nwas just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another.\"\n\nI felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way\ndifferent from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at\nhome, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I\nwent every New Year's Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle's\nfriend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly\nmanner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance\nwhich I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical\nexpression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead.\nI had difficulty in believing that this was one of 'those women,' and\ncertainly I should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had I\nnot seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had\nI not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them.\nBut I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her\nflat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away\nupon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet,\nwhen I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed\nme more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and\nrecognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a\nnovel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home\nof her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind\nwhich had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised\nto fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the\nintonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me\nregard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who\nwas no longer of a family at all.\n\nWe had gone by this time into the 'study,' and my uncle, who seemed a\ntrifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.\n\n\"No, thank you, dear friend,\" she said. \"You know I only smoke the ones\nthe Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.\" And\nshe drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in\na foreign language. \"Why, yes,\" she began again suddenly. \"Of course I\nhave met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on\nearth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,\" she\nwent on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what\nmust actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been\nso charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked,\nas though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the\nexcessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality.\nIt has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part\nplayed in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote\nall their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of\nsentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise\nthe value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame\nof everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the\nfashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched\nand ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the\nsmoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat,\nwith her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the\nrefinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same\nway, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up\ndelicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a\nglance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility\nand gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work\nof art, into something altogether charming.\n\n\"Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,\" said my uncle.\n\nI rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady\nin pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a\nforcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to\nmyself \"Shall I do it, shall I not?\" and then I ceased to ask myself\nwhat I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly,\nmadly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such\naction, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.\n\n\"Isn't he delicious! Quite a ladies' man already; he takes after his\nuncle. He'll be a perfect 'gentleman,'\" she went on, setting her teeth\nso as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. \"Couldn't he come\nto me some day for 'a cup of tea,' as our friends across the channel\nsay; he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning?\"\n\nI had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be. I did not understand\nhalf the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be\nconcealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to\nanswer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was\nbeginning to feel extremely tired.\n\n\"No, no; it is impossible,\" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. \"He\nis kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings\nback all the prizes from his school,\" he added in a lower tone, so that\nI should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction.\n\"You can't tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of\nVaulabelle, don't you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, I love artistic people,\" replied the lady in pink; \"there is no\none like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like\nyourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is\nit those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You\nknow you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.\"\n\nMy uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me\nout into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my\nold uncle's tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he,\nawkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that\nhe would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured\nhim, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an\nimpression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of\nexpressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me\nthat two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did\nnot strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new\nimportance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let\nthem have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid\nthat afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any\nunpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not\nwish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in\na visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not\nsome friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some\nwoman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget\nto do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a\nsilence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else,\nthat the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles\nwith no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be\napplied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in\nthe minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my\nuncle's I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment\nI myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had\nrecourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested\nthey should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's\nconduct. My father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent\norder; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in\nthe street as he drove by in an open carriage, � felt at once all the\ngrief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to\nhim. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to\nraise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make\nhim think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the\ncommonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a\ngesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I\nwas obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he\ndid not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him\nagain.\n\nAnd so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept\nshut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts\nof the back-kitchen until Fran�oise appeared on its threshold and\nannounced: \"I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take\nup the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\" I would then\ndecide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read.\nThe kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution\nto which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and\ncontinuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human\nshapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the\nsame girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such\nquantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress\nthem was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when\nwe arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that\nFran�oise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so\nmuch work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in\nbearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day,\nwhose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample\nsmocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of\nthe allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given\nme photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he\ninquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: \"Well, how goes it with\nGiotto's Charity?\" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled\nand stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical,\nsquared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins,\nso strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are\npersonified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues\nand Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as\nthe figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which\nshe carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant,\nwithout any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and\nspiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather\nheavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is\nabout that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena\nbeneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung\nupon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for\nit seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found\nexpression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the\npainter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at\nher feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to\nextract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of\nsacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart\nto God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might\nhand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to\nsome one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level\nabove. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of\nenvy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and\nis represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips\nof Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that\nthe muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who\nis filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves\nfor that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours\nare concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to\nspare for envious thoughts.\n\nDespite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures\nof Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing\nin our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that\nCharity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much\nas a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the\nglottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of\nthe operator's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular\nfeatures were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain\ngood and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to\nsee at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces\nof Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting\nstrangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part\nplayed in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these\nwere depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere\nexpressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled,\nadded something more precise and more literal to their meaning,\nsomething more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted.\nAnd even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention\nincessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the\nsame way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of\ndeath often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal,\nintestinal aspect, towards that 'seamy side' of death which is, as it\nhappens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them\nto feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a\ndifficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to\nwhich we are accustomed to give the name of Death?\n\nThere must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and\nVices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as\nthe pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less\nallegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack)\nof participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own\nspecial virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which,\nif not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical.\nLater on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet\nwith, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical\ncharity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and\nslightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern\nno commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and\nno fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the\nsublime face of true goodness.\n\nThen while the kitchen-maid--who, all unawares, made the superior\nqualities of Fran�oise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by\nforce of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth--took in coffee which\n(according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried\nup to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying\nstretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled\nwith the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the\nafternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however,\na reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden\nwings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner,\nlike a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for\nme to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was\nderived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cur�,\nby Camus (whom Fran�oise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and\nthat he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from\nwhich nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din\nof them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed\nto scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who\nperformed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the\nchamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from\nan air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a\nfine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies'\nmusic is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie--born of\nsunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something\nof their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our\nmemory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they\nare close around us, immediately accessible.\n\nThis dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street\nwhat the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous,\nand presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which\nmy senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in\nfragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose,\nwhich (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just\nexcited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running\nwater, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.\n\nBut my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had\nbroken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up\nand beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I\nwould go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little\nsentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I\nused to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might\nbe coming to call upon the family.\n\nAnd then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole,\nin the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain\ninvisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw\nany external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain\nbetween me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which\nprevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material\nform; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch\nit, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet\nnever actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by\na zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different\nstates and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold\nwhile I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden\naspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon\nspread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the\nfirst the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever\nwhose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the\nphilosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire\nto appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if\nI had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose\ngrocery lay too far from our house for Fran�oise to be able to deal\nthere, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a\nstationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to\nkeep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which\nadorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more\nteeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed\nand bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which\nhad been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the\nschool-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be\nentrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me,\nhalf-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but\npermanent object of my thoughts.\n\nNext to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be\nconstantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the\ndiscovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in\nwhich I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with\nmore dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole\nlifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was\nreading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what\nFran�oise would have called 'real people.' But none of the feelings\nwhich the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be\nawakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes;\nand the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding\nthat, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated\nstructure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted\nin the suppression, pure and simple, of 'real' people would be a decided\nimprovement. A 'real' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him,\nis in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to\nsay, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities\nhave not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is\nonly in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that\nwe are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small\nsection of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of\nfeeling any emotion either. The novelist's happy discovery was to think\nof substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human\nspirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which\nthe spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the\nactions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in\nthe guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in\nourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall,\nwhile we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened\nbreath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that\nstate, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is\nmultiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might\na dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than\nthose which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour\nhe sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of\nwhich, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting\nto know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have\nbeen revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops\nour perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and\nthat is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by\nimagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural\nphenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish,\nsuccessively, each of its different states, we are still spared the\nactual sensation of change.\n\nNext to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human\nelement, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes,\nof the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which\nmade a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual\nlandscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In\nthis way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our\nCombray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then\nreading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless\nvista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of\nwood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and\nclustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was\nalways lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with\nher love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the\nfreshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the\nwoman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once\nspring up on either side of her like complementary colours.\n\nThis was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever\ndistinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not\nits own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the\nscenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly\nportrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before\nmy eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that\nthe author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which\nmy mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might\nbe interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the\nimpression--one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which\nI might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished\nproduct of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my\ngrandmother so despised--of their being actually part of Nature herself,\nand worthy to be studied and explored.\n\nHad my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the\ncountry it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous\nadvance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have\nthe sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul,\nstill it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem\nto be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it,\nto break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear\nendlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from\nwithout, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to\ndiscover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual\nglamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned,\nand learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm\nwhich they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas;\nsometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so\nas to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well\nknow, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And\nso, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever\nplaces I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings\nit was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an\nunknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association\nof thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were\nonly moments--which I isolate artificially to-day as though I\nwere cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water,\nrainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion--were only drops\nin a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my\nlife.\n\nAnd then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions\nfrom their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and\nbefore I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover\npleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting\nthe good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and,\nwhen an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what\nwas already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the\nlast stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the\nsilence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky\nabove me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading,\nuntil the good dinner which Fran�oise was even now preparing should come\nto strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero\nthrough the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to\nme that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest\nwould inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface,\nand I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed\ninto the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden\nfigures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would\nsound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour\nwhich I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not\ntaken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the\ndeepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated\nthe sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping\nsilence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our\nCombray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace\nincident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange\nadventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still\nrecall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you,\nand you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little\ndrawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat\nof the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering\nin form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent,\nsonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.\n\nSometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon,\nby the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing,\noverturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a\ntooth, and screaming out \"They're coming, they're coming!\" so that\nFran�oise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That\nwas on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some\nmilitary exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While\nour servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden\nrailings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and\nwere stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which\nthere was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would\nhave spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in\nwith their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue\nSainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling\nhorses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning\nthe pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river\nin flood.\n\n\"Poor children,\" Fran�oise would exclaim, in tears almost before she\nhad reached the railings; \"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a\nmeadow. It's just shocking to think of,\" she would go on, laying a hand\nover her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.\n\n\"A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Fran�oise, all these young fellows not\ncaring two straws for their lives?\" the gardener would ask, just to\n'draw' her. And he would not have spoken in vain.\n\n\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that\nwe should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never\noffers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same;\nit's quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those\nwretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing\nmore nor less than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a\nrope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions.\" For\nby her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to\npronounce 'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.\n\nThe Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see\npeople approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap\nbetween those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still\nmake out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the\nsunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to\ncome, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his\nhead. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from\na beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and,\nhaving risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us,\nwith a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least\na thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction\nof Thiberzy and M�s�glise. Fran�oise and the gardener, having 'made up'\ntheir difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.\n\n\"Don't you see, Fran�oise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better,\nbecause then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n\nThe gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop\nall the railways.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure; so that we sha'n't get away,\" said Fran�oise.\n\nAnd the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for\nhe would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the\nstate attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the\nworld who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n\nBut Fran�oise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my\nbook, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to\nwatch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the\npassage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored,\nan abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of\nCormbray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not,\nas a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would\nsit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe,\nlike the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual\nleaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when\nthe sea itself has retreated.\n\nExcept on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read\nin peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and\nthe commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading,\nwhich had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called\nBergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards\nit was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a\nwholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I\nwould see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n\nI had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older\nthan myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the\nname of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he\nhad burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me,\nby way of warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset,\nEsquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable\nspecimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that\nhe, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life,\ncompose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is\nin my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n\n\n  _La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire_,\n\nand the other\n\n\n  _La fille de Minos et de Pasipha�_.\"\n\nThey were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the\ntwo runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who\nis found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token,\nhere is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book\nrecommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so\nthey tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe,\nmore subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he\nexhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering\nfools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make\nallowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic\nOracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic\nmaster-builder of rhythm who composed _Bhagavat_ and the _L�vrier de\nMagnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my\nmaster, the ambrosial joys of Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of\nsarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me,\n\"my master.\" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount\nof satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one\nbelieves that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.\n\nUnfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with\nBloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts\nhe had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from\nwhich I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of\ntruth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For,\nas it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he\nhad been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out\nthat, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and\nbrought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he\nwould not have objected on principle--indeed his own friend Swann was\nof Jewish extraction--had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as\nfriends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able\nto bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O,\nGod of our fathers\" from _La Juive_, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\"\nsinging the tune alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but\nI used to be afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being\nable to reconstruct the words.\n\nBefore seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often\nas not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only\nthe Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen\npeople, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n\n\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n\n\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n\n\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n\nAnd he would sing:\n\n\n  Archers, be on your guard!\n  Watch without rest, without sound,\n\nand then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would\ncall out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who\nhad already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my\ngrandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my\ngrandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely\nlook at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of\n\n\n  What! do you hither guide the feet\n  Of this timid Israelite?\n\nor of\n\n\n  Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields,\n\nor, perhaps, of\n\n\n  Yes, I am of the chosen race.\n\nThese little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will\nwhatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for\nother reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come\nin with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n\n\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I\ncan't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n\nWhich drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am\nabsolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so\nresolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer\ntrouble to inform me of them.\"\n\n\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out\nof his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As\nif there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n\nNext, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when\nshe complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped\nthe tears from his eyes.\n\n\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he\ndoesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n\nAnd finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour\nand a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and\nmade not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be\ninfluenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or\nby the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly\nreintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but\nI am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more\npernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the\numbrella and the watch.\"\n\nIn spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He\nwas, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for\nme; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on\nhearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they\nknew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early\nimpulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and\nthe conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty\nto our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule\nof life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly\nfollowed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They\nwould have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would\nhave given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class\nmorality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly\nsend me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have\nthought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of\ninclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and\nemotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were\nas incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries\nwe do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us\nthose conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who,\nafter quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again,\nyet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the\nwhole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the\n'proper thing' to do.\n\nBut I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the\ninsoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely\nmeaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasipha�_ tired me more\nand made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with\nhim, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he\nwould still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same\nnight, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a\ngreat influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then\nmore unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that\nthere was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome,\nhe had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable\nauthority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger\ndays, and had been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing\non so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time\nBloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the\nstreet, he greeted me with extreme coldness.\n\nBut in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n\nFor the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head\nand maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment\n'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style\nhad not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel\nof his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the\nstory alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet\na woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine\nit is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic\nphrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow\nof harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would\nanimate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these,\ntoo, that he would begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the\n\"inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture\nof understanding and loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for\nall time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he\nwould express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of\nmarvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have\nascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears,\nan accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and\nsublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I\nhad detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy\nI had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt\nmyself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep,\nundivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to\nhave been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised\nin this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts\nof music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the\nearlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source\nof my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted\nby a particular passage in one of Bergotte's works, which traced a\npurely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but\nrather of the 'ideal passage' of Bergotte, common to every one of his\nbooks, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming\nmerged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own\nunderstanding seemed to be enlarged.\n\nI was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer\nalso of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du\nBoulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's\nlatest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in\na park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that\ntaste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally\nacclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe\nand America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its\nrefinement, but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would\nseem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte\nwas just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned\nphrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by\nhim, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on\nhis part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness,\na tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that\nthese were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had\nhit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral,\nhe would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a\nlengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in\nthe earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose,\ndiscernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more\ndelightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when\nthe reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the\ncurrent began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he\ndelighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them\nby heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his\nnarrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until\nthen remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of\n_Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or of _Ph�dre_, by some piece\nof imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its\nessence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable\nelements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he\nnot bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion,\nsome metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon\nsuch things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for\nmyself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the\nhistoric buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the\nemphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he\nregarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost\neverything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt\nthat it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an\nunknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced\nthat my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected\nspirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to\nfind in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own\nmind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity\nhad, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be\nbeautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte\nwould express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when\nI was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so\nconcisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of\nmottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later\nyears, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some\nof my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to\ngo on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences\nin Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages,\nthat I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in\nmy anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have\ndetected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to\nlife,' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be\npleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of\nideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory\nattempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no\npleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came\nsuddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say\nstripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and\nself-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite\nfor such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to\nprepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And\nso, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about\nan old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a\ngreat deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to\nmy grandmother about Fran�oise, and when, another time, I had discovered\nthat he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of\nabsolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I\nhad had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my\nremarks on Fran�oise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would\nmost resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief\nthat he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly\nrevealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were\nless widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they\nwere actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept\nupon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.\n\nFrom his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and\ndisappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found\nany consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in\nmy brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself\nhad, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears\nwith something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than\nanything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged\nmyself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the\nage when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called\n'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but\nsimply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and,\nif I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to\nfollow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by\nthe despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when\na friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to\ncome.\n\nOne Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by\nSwann, who had come to call upon my parents.\n\n\"What are you reading? May I look? Why, it's Bergotte! Who has been\ntelling you about him?\"\n\nI replied that Bloch was responsible.\n\n\"Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini\nportrait of Mahomet II. It's an astonishing likeness; he has the same\narched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard\ncomes he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte\nis a charming creature.\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire\nBergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made\nan exception in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like\nhim to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him\nfor you.\"\n\nI dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions\nabout his friend. \"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\"\n\n\"Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the\nstage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have\nyou seen her?\"\n\n\"No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.\"\n\n\"That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in _Ph�dre_, in the _Cid_;\nwell, she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't\nbelieve very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts.\" As he spoke I\nnoticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with\nmy grandmother's sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters,\nwhenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion\nupon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise\nit by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he\nhad put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious\nto disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say \"the\n'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly people call it.\" But then, if it\nwas so absurd, why did he say the 'hierarchy'? A moment later he went\non: \"Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece\nof art in the world, as--oh, I don't know--\" and he began to laugh,\n\"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\" Until then I had supposed that\nhis horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian\nand refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's\nsisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the\nmental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved,\nwhere, by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier\ngenerations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise\nfacts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of\n'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked\nby this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with\ngeneralities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and\nto be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy,\nsome precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take\ninto account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief\n(as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an\nimportance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I\nhad been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and\nwhen he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de L�on as being\nof no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he\nwas devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve\nthe duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things,\nof formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas;\nand when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at\nthe same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the\nmanner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do\nhim justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that\nwriter's admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and\nby Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a\ncharming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things,\nwhich is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look\nfor his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once.\" But\nnone of them had yet gone so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has\ngreat talent.\" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They\ndid not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in\nrecognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which\nis labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Simply\nbecause that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no\nresemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather\noriginality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the\nsum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.\n\n\"Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?\" I asked\nM. Swann.\n\n\"I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of\nprint. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find\nout. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next\ntime he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year's\nend to another. He is my daughter's greatest friend. They go about\ntogether, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.\"\n\nAs I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social\nhierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see\nanything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the\ncontrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an\nenormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in\nmy eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her\nlips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann\ndid, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to\nher, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on\naccount of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and\none of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same\nfeatures and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily,\nbut with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned\nthat Mlle. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate\ncircumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of\nprivilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming\nto dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with\ncelestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to\nher no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the\nintimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's\nconversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those\nsubjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on\nwhich I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all,\nwhen she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side,\nunrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from\nheaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth\nof a creature such as Mlle. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and\nignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and\nyet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was\nfilled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this\ntime forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the\nporch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant,\nand, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as\nher friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies\nwhich the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the\nhills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy,\nwould radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my\nmind of Mlle. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love\nher. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown\nexistence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us\nadmission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts,\nthe one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him\ngenerous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend\nthat they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an\nemanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall\nin love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less\nparticular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the\ncrushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more\ngallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king\nor a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most\ngratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic\nprofile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.\n\nWhile I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never\nhave understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which\nit was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she\nherself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said,\n\"How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn't Sunday, you\nknow!\" putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness\nand waste of time), my aunt L�onie would be gossiping with Fran�oise\nuntil it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had\njust seen Mme. Goupil go by \"without an umbrella, in the silk dress\nshe had made for her the other day at Ch�teaudun. If she has far to go\nbefore vespers, she may get it properly soaked.\"\n\n\"Very likely\" (which meant also \"very likely not\") was the answer,\nfor Fran�oise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a\nhappier alternative.\n\n\"There, now,\" went on my aunt, beating her brow, \"that reminds me that\nI never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I\nmust remember to ask Eulalie... Fran�oise, just look at that black cloud\nbehind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be\ncertain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn't possibly keep on\nlike this, it's been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the\nstorm breaks my Vichy water won't 'go down,'\" she concluded, since, in\nher mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was\nof infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil's\nnew dress ruined.\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"And you know that when it rains in the Square there's none too much\nshelter.\" Suddenly my aunt turned pale. \"What, three o'clock!\" she\nexclaimed. \"But vespers will have begun already, and I've forgotten my\npepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\"\nAnd falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet,\nwith gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of\nthe little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she\nused to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt,\nwhile she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words\nof the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by\nthe uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the\nVichy, would still be able to overtake it and to 'send it down.' \"Three\no'clock! It's unbelievable how time flies.\"\n\nA little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it,\nfollowed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower\nof sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall\nspread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming,\nmusical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.\n\n\"There, Fran�oise, what did I tell you? How it's coming down! But I\nthink I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be\noutside in this weather.\"\n\nFran�oise went and returned. \"It's Mme. Am�d�e\" (my grandmother). \"She\nsaid she was going for a walk. It's raining hard, all the same.\"\n\n\"I'm not at all surprised,\" said my aunt, looking up towards the sky.\n\"I've always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well,\nI'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this.\"\n\n\"Mme. Am�d�e is always the exact opposite of the rest,\" said Fran�oise,\nnot unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other\nservants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her\nhead.'\n\n\"There's Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,\" sighed my aunt.\n\"It will be the weather that's frightened her away.\"\n\n\"But it's not five o'clock yet, Mme. Octave, it's only half-past four.\"\n\n\"Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small\ncurtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only\na week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Fran�oise, the dear Lord\nmust be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days.\nAs my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He\nis taking vengeance upon us.\"\n\nA bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck\nwould have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when\nFran�oise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her\nfull participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings\nwould give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in\nspite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was\nrepeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new\nvisitor had condescended to use, said: \"His reverence the Cur� would be\ndelighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and\ncould see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His\nreverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.\"\n\nHad the truth been known, the Cur�'s visits gave my aunt no such\necstatic pleasure as Fran�oise supposed, and the air of jubilation with\nwhich she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce\nhis arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her\ninvalid. The Cur� (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did\nnot converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts,\nhe knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing\ndistinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile\na history of the Parish of Combray), used to weary her with his endless\nexplanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree.\nBut when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie's it became frankly\ndistasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of\nEulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one\ntime. But she dared not send the Cur� away, and had to content herself\nwith making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she\nmight have her to herself for a little after he had gone.\n\n\"What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his\neasel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am,\nI can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my\nlife! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing\nin the whole church, too.\"\n\n\"I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for,\nalthough there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth\na visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica,\nthe only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored.\nThe Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a\nmajestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though\npersonally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but\nexperts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that\napart from certain details which are--well, a trifle realistic, they\nshew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don't\ntalk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave\nup windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by\nthrowing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give\na name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level?\nAnd yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please,\nthose are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of\nGuermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of\nthe present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a\nlady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin.\" (My grandmother,\nwhose steady refusal to take any interest in 'persons' had ended in\nher confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the\nDuchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme.\nde Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she\nwould attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to\na christening or funeral: \"I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it\nsomewhere.\" And for once I would side with the others, and against\nher, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her\nschool-friend and the descendant of Genevi�ve de Brabant.)\n\n\"Look at Roussainville,\" the Cur� went on. \"It is nothing more nowadays\nthan a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had\na considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I\nam not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I\nshould dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from\n_Radulfi villa_, analogous, don't you see, to Ch�teauroux, _Castrum\nRadulfi_, but we will talk about that some other time.) Very well; the\nchurch there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that\nmost imposing 'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray' which would be more\nin keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I\nunderstand, as the famous windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr.\nPercepied's brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that\nhe looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to\nthis artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a\nregular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to\nhim, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything,\na little dingier than the rest?\"\n\n\"I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,\" said my aunt in\na resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be\n'tired,' \"he would never refuse you a new window.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,\" replied the Cur�. \"Why, it was\njust his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by\nproving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and\na direct descendant of Genevi�ve de Brabant, who was a daughter of the\nHouse of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.\"\n\n\"But I don't see where Saint Hilaire comes in.\"\n\n\"Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in\na yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you\nwill remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint\nH�lier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions\nof _Sanctus Hilarius_ are by no means the most curious that have\noccurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good\nEulalie, the case of your own patron, _Sancta Eulalia_; do you know what\nshe has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady\nhas become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead\nthey will make a man of you!\"\n\n\"Father will always have his joke.\"\n\n\"Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but,\nhaving early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a\nresult of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all\nthe arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his\nyouth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face\nhe did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last\ninhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church\nat Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which\nTh�odebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near\nhere, at Thiberzy (which is, of course, _Theodeberiacus_), to go out\nand fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint\nHilaire if the Saint brought him; victory. Nothing remains of it now\nbut the crypt, into which Th�odore has probably taken you, for Gilbert\nburned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the\naid of William\" which the Cur� pronounced \"Will'am\" \"the Conqueror,\nwhich is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he\ndoes not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of\nCombray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut\noff his head. Th�odore has a little book, that he lends people, which\ntells you the whole story.\n\n\"But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church\nis the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in\nyour case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you:\nto climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in\nthe famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most\nactive person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if\nyou don't wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off\nthe staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped\nup,\" he went on, without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion\nthat she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry,\n\"for there's a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people\neven assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No\nmatter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come,\nsome of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they\nalways go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you\nwill be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must\nadmit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with\nwhat you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special\ncharm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And\nthen another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in\nthe habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course\nof the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-l�s-Combray, which\nare separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another\nexample, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is\n_Gaudiacus vicecomitis_, as of course you know. Each time that I have\nbeen to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have\nturned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no\nlonger see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one\nanother; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite\nanother matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a\nmap. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were\ngreat rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a\nloaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To\nget it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up\nhere on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.\"\n\nThe Cur� had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than\nshe was obliged to send away Eulalie also.\n\n\"Here, my poor Eulalie,\" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from\na small purse which lay ready to her hand. \"This is just something so\nthat you shall not forget me in your prayers.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well\nthat I don't come here for that!\" So Eulalie would answer, with the\nsame hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though\neach temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which\nenlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that\nEulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual,\nmy aunt would remark afterwards, \"I cannot think what has come over\nEulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look\nat all pleased.\"\n\n\"I don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,\"\nFran�oise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty\ncash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as\ntreasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the\nlittle coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so\ndiscreetly passed that Fran�oise never managed to see them. It was\nnot that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed\non Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my\naunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress\nautomatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world;\nand that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout\nCombray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my\naunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Cur�, and\nthe astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed.\nFran�oise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over\nmy aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest\nambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with\na maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what\nmy aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give\naway, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps\nshe felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's\npresents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on\nthat account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and\nposition, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil,\nto persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally\n'mix with her,' seemed to Fran�oise to be included among the ornamental\ncustoms of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who\nhunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would\ncontemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same\nthing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted\nmere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Fran�oise\nwould label \"people like myself,\" or \"people no better than myself,\"\npeople whom she despised even more if they did not address her always\nas \"Mme. Fran�oise,\" just to shew that they considered themselves to be\n'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt\ncontinued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with\nboth hands (or so, at least, Fran�oise believed) on undeserving objects,\nshe began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt\nwere very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon\nEulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such\nprosperity and importance that Fran�oise doubted Eulalie's ability to\nbuy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to\nmy aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an\nexactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Fran�oise.\nSo, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Fran�oise would mercilessly\nprophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same\ntime afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to 'look\npleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's departure;\nnever, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in\nSibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like\nthose of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special\napplication could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of\nthe curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her;\n\"Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the\ncrumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and\none fine day He will be avenged upon them!\" she would declaim, with the\nsidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when\nhe says that the\n\n            ....prosperity\n  Of wicked men runs like a torrent past,\n  And soon is spent.\n\nBut on this memorable afternoon, when the Cur� had come as well, and\nby his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, Fran�oise\nfollowed Eulalie from the room, saying: \"Mme. Octave, I will leave you\nto rest; you look utterly tired out.\"\n\nAnd my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that\nit seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as\nthough already dead. But hardly had Fran�oise arrived downstairs, when\nfour peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated\nthrough the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out:\n\"Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether\nMme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her,\nquick!\"\n\nBut Fran�oise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. \"It\nis most provoking,\" said my aunt, shaking her head. \"The one important\nthing that I had to ask her.\"\n\nIn this way life went by for my aunt L�onie, always the same, in the\ngentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation\nbut with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all\nand sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having\nlearned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had\nbecome gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well,\nwhere, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a\npacking-case would send first to Fran�oise to make sure that my aunt\nwas not 'resting'--her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally\ndisturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among\nits leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it\nfalls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's\nconfinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife\nin Combray, Fran�oise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from\nThiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl,\nand as Fran�oise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in\nreturning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of\nthe morning, my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt\nwants anything.\"\n\nI went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the\nother saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing,\nin what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip\naway when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her\nsleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays,\nfor the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a\nlower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see\nfor the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she\nhad just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from\nwhere she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go\nforward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense\nof reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified\nher; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased\nto grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined\nher face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself,\nhalf-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: \"The Lord be\npraised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby.\nAnd I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and\nwas trying to make me take a walk every day!\" She stretched out a hand\ntowards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was\nonce again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to\nreach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the\nroom on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from\nthat day to this, what I had seen and heard.\n\nWhen I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my\naunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include\nthose variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical\nform, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon\nthe greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as\nFran�oise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin,\nthe whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my\naunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to\nher general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She\nwas so well 'routined' to it, as Fran�oise would say, that if, on a\nSaturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour,\nit would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary\nday, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this\nacceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual\ncharacter, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily,\nthere was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded,\nwe would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives\nmake their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an\nomelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday\nwas one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost\ncivic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a\nkind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation,\nfor pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator\npleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary\ncycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were\ndressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the\nstrength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly,\ncordially, patriotically, \"Hurry up; there's no time to be lost; don't\nforget, it's Saturday!\" while my aunt, gossiping with Fran�oise, and\nreflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, \"You\nmight cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it's Saturday.\" If, at\nhalf-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, \"I\nsay, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\" everyone else would\nbe in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: \"Why, what are you\nthinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's Saturday?\" And a quarter\nof an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to\ngo up and tell aunt L�onie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The\nvery face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the\nsun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the\nzenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for\nour walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\" feeling the heavy throb go by\nhim of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as\na rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the\nmidday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the\nbright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and\nso slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering\nclouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus:\n\"Why, you're forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very\nwell it's Saturday.\"\n\nThe surprise of a 'barbarian' (for so we termed everyone who was not\nacquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at eleven\no'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event\nwhich used to cause Fran�oise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything\nthat had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the\nnonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our\nluncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly\nfunny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom\nof her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never\nhave dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a\nmatter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the\nother's surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: \"You see, it's\nSaturday.\" On reaching this point in the story, Fran�oise would pause to\nwipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own\nenjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for\nthe visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far\nfrom our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story\nwas not yet long enough, and would rally her with: \"Oh, but surely he\nsaid something else as well. There was more than that, the first time\nyou told it.\"\n\nMy great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and\nlook on at us over her glasses.\n\nThe day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May\nwe used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the 'Month of\nMary' devotions.\n\nAs we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict\nviews on \"the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to\nbe encouraged in these days,\" my mother would first see that there was\nnothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for\nthe church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember\nhaving first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not\nmerely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us\na right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from\nthe mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in\namong the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to\none another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and\nthey were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark\nleaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train,\nlittle clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look\nat them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme\nwas composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by\ntrimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament\nof those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at\nonce a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar,\na flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so\nunconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of\nstamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a\nwhite mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate,\nsomewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it\nas a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance\nfrom her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and\nalive.\n\nM. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us.\nHe belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to\nmy grandmother's sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and\ninheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of\nCombray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense\nprudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet\nSwann, who had made what he called \"a most unsuitable marriage, as\nseems to be the fashion in these days.\" My mother, on hearing that he\n'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see\nhim, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked\nnothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others\nto so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was\nafraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out,\nor even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day\nwhen my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them,\nbut they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil's house,\nMontjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill\ncovered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a\nlevel with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its\nwindow. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived,\nI had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music\nso as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had\nsnatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of\nletting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave\nhim a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time\nthat my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject\nof his playing, he had hurriedly protested: \"I cannot think who put that\non the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,\" and had turned\nthe conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of\nless interest to himself.\n\nHis one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her\nsomewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to\nrestrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take\nfor her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around\nher shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle,\ndelicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting\nacross the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid\nchild. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the\nsense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed\nat the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear\noutline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the\n'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears.\n\nWhen, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before\nthe altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of\nalmonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed\nthat on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour,\nin which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste\nof an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mlle.\nVinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless\nsilence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like\nthe murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was\nquivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I\nwas reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed\nto have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging\ninsects now transmuted into flowers.\n\nOutside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil,\nin the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he\nwould interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the\nbig. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she\nhad been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and\nmore sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,\nschoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was\nangling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange\na cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart\nwhich she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain.\nAs for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and\nstirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then,\ninstead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal\ndistinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my\nmother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing\nwhich road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his\nstrategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which\nbegan to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and\nto me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of\ncivilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would\nbe warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss\nthe station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start\nagain in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of\nChristendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit.\nWe would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most\nattractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight,\ncopying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases\nof white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its\nbeams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was\na column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which\nendures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and\nready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a\nconsolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering\nand exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart\nthe watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up\nan antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the\nevenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray\nwere constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must\nhave taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their\nalternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its\nlime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon.\n\nSuddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my\nmother--\"Where are we?\" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of\nher husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least\nidea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had\nslipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point\nout to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own\ngarden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue\ndu Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings\nover paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly \"You really are\nwonderful!\" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the\nground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long,\nmy actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my\nwill. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to\nmy bed, and laid me down there like a little child.\n\nAlthough Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her\nof the services of Fran�oise, passed more slowly than other days for my\naunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look\nforward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all\nthe novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was\nstill able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not\nlong, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not\npass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something\ndifferent from what one has, when those people who, through lack of\nenergy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in\nthemselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in\ntheir eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion\n(even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has\nsilenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again\nby some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when\nthe will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its\nimpulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled\ndesires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins\ninto the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of\ncourse, since my aunt's strength, which was completely drained by the\nslightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her\nrepose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by\nbefore she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily\nactivities, but which she had no idea--and could never decide how to\nemploy. And I have no doubt that then--just as a desire to have her\npotatoes served with b�chamel sauce, for a change, would be formed,\nultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of\nthose mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired'--she would extract\nfrom the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much\ndepended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous\nin its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect,\nonce for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to\nher health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some\nsuch stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the\nlong luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when\nshe felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house\nwas being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already\nperished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone\nstanding upon another, but from which she herself would still have\nplenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose\nat once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect\nwhich combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the\nfull savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of\ncausing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally\nforth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but\nerect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right\nmoment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to\ngo off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where\nthere was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever\noccurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of\nsuch a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of\npatience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first\nmoment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen\nfacts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never\nafterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it\nthe imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the\nlogical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time\nto time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor\ncatastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile\nherself with a sudden suspicion that Fran�oise had been robbing her,\nthat she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer\nred-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by\nherself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would\nfirst stammer out Fran�oise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them\nwith such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude\nupon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration,\nher eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness\nof her brows. Fran�oise must often, from the next room, have heard these\nmordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words\nwould not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been\nallowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree\nof substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them\nhalf-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not\nsatisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday,\nwith all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her\ndoubts of Fran�oise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her,\nand on another day she would confide in Fran�oise her suspicions of the\ndisloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed\nfor good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she\nwould again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the\nnext performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But\nthe suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no\nmore than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel,\nsince Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very\ndifferent matter when the suspect was Fran�oise, of whose presence under\nthe same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for\nfear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare\ngo downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was,\nindeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until\nher mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the\nday, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her\nby Fran�oise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Fran�oise's\nfeatures, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire\nwhich she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was\nunmasked, by, a single word, which made Fran�oise turn pale, and which\nmy aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy\nservant's heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie--like\none of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field\nfor exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only\nthe beaten paths--proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell\na long way short of the appalling truth. \"But Fran�oise ought to know\nthat,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her a carriage.\"\n\n\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt.\n\n\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in\nher open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market.\nI supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n\nSo on by degrees, until Fran�oise and my aunt, the quarry and the\nhunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices.\nMy mother was afraid lest Fran�oise should develop a genuine hatred of\nmy aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However\nthat might be, Fran�oise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely\nscrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had\nto ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time,\nmaking up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her\nrequest, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the\nexpression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply.\nAnd in this way--whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the\nseventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great\nLouis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when\nhe constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic\nfamily, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning\nSovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was\nmaking in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore\nlifeless copy of mere outward forms--a middle-aged lady in a small\ncountry town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her\nown irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered\nby the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having\ngiven a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily\nlife, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by\nvirtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was\nto be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at\nVersailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence,\na shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide\nFran�oise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and\nterror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King\nwhen a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition\nto him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles.\n\nOne Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Cur�\nand from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the\nwhole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured\nto condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both\nvisitors to her door at the same time.\n\n\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, L�onie,\" she said kindly,\n\"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n\nAnd my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\" for, since\nher daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as\nfar as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of\nthings. But my father had begun to speak.\n\n\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being\nhere together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over\nagain to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's\nbad books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n\nI did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with\nhim myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went\ndownstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner,\nwhich was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and\nexcited me as might the programme of a coming festivity.\n\nAs M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church,\nwalking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the\nneighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in\na manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M.\nLegrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of\nsurprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look\ncharacteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from\nthe suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of\nyou at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great\na distance that they content themselves with directing towards you\nan almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your\ndoll-like dimensions.\n\nNow, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue,\nknown and highly respected; there could be no question of his being\nout for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father\nasked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend.\n\n\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he\nsaid, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there\nis something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft\nneckties, so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of\ninnocence, almost, which is really attractive.\"\n\nBut the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had\nimagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question,\nhad been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my\nfather's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening.\nAs we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin\nhimself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more\nin Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know,\nmaster book-lover,\" he asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n\n\n  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n\nIs not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have\nnever read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he\nis converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have\nthe most charming water-colour touch--\n\n\n  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue.\n\nMay you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even\nwhen the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all\nblack, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself,\nas I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from\nhis pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon.\n\"Goodbye, friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n\nAt the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was\nfor dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Fran�oise,\na colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the\nfairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be\nstirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right\nmoment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had\nbeen first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of\nthe potter's craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons\nand fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny\npannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and\npans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the\nkitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up\nin ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but\nwhat fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine\nand rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and\nazure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white\nfeet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a\nrainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these\ncelestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had\nbeen pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which\ncovered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this\nradiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening\nshades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all\nnight long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played\n(lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's\n_Dream_) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic\nperfume.\n\nPoor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Fran�oise with\nthe task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside\nher in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows\nof the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which\ncapped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and\nseparately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers\nbanded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua.\nAnd, meanwhile, Fran�oise would be turning on the spit one of those\nchickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted\nfar abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while\nshe was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness\npredominate for the moment in my private conception of her character;\nthe aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous\nand so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of\nher many virtues.\n\nBut the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon\nour strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one\nof those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her\nrecent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Fran�oise,\nbeing without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw\nher in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of\nkilling a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which\nFran�oise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat\nbeneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \"Filthy creature!\nFilthy creature!\" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our\nservant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when\nit made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and\nits precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it\nwas dead Fran�oise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however,\nshe did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst\nof rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final\n\"Filthy creature!\"\n\nI crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could\nhave prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Fran�oise. But who\nwould have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and\neven--roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had\nalready had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt L�onie knew\n(though I was still in ignorance of this) that Fran�oise, who, for her\nown daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a\nmurmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest\nof the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while\nconscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began\ngradually to realise that Fran�oise's kindness, her compunction, the\nsum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies,\njust as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens\nwho are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of\nchurches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of\nthe fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity\ninspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance\nseparating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her\nin torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her,\nin a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a\nmore accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after\nher confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling\npains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Fran�oise, who,\nquite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that\nthe girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house. The doctor, who\nhad been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical\ndictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were\ndescribed, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find\nthe measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent Fran�oise\nto fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour\nelapsed, and Fran�oise had not returned; my mother, supposing that\nshe had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the\nbookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Fran�oise who,\nin her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read\nthe clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing,\nnow that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not\nfamiliar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would\nexclaim: \"Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any\nwretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\"\n\nBut when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of\nGiotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no\nstimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she\nvery well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal\nof newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of\nweariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of\nthe night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very\nsufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she\nhad nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter\nsarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot:\n\"Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all\nthis about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better\nnot put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken\nyoung man to go after _that_. Dear, dear, it's just as they used to say\nin my poor mother's country:\n\n\n  Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs' tails,\n    And dirty sluts in plenty,\n  Smell sweeter than roses in young men's noses\n    When the heart is one-and-twenty.\"\n\nAlthough, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would set\noff at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to\nsee whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot\nbefore daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love\nfor her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of\nher house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to\nthe other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any\nof them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride\nin not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she\nherself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in\nperson, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry\ninto her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera,\nobserved by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a\nsupply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls\nin the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive\ncruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds\nwith marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which\ntheir power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions)\ndepends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid,\nwill furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive\nquarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh\nfor the larder: in the same way Fran�oise had adopted, to minister\nto her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house\nuninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless\nstratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on\nasparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the\nsmell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them,\nsuch violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my\naunt's service.\n\nAlas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one\nof the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after\nwhich my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass\ndrew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world,\nsomething else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that\nMme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when\nI arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed\non their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen\nme come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little\nkneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in\nloud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as\nthough we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the\nsun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the\nmarket, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with\nhim, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife\nof another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face\nshewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with\na subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a\nposition behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have\nbeen trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid\nrecovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's\nhips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but\nthis undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the\nleast hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury\nby the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke\nmy mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different\nfrom the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her\ncoachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression\nof joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there,\nstill lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled,\nthen he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than\nusual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left,\nin the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he\nabandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he\nwere the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile\nwe were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him;\nhe was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which\nhad suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his\nvision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us,\nand so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with\nan air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked\nas though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself,\nand plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted\nnecktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in\nfront of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his\nnoble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered\nthat we had forgotten the 'Saint-Honor�,' and asked my father to go\nback with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met\nLegrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting\nto her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was\nsaying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little\nsign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as\nit did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to\npass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the\nintensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which\nthey had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set\napart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went\nfar beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of\nroguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink\nof connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the\nmysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances\nof friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a\ndeclaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret\nand languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an\nenamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.\n\nOnly the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him\non this same Sunday evening. \"Come and bear your aged friend company,\"\nhe had said to me. \"Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from\nsome land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from\nthe far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of\nspring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with\nthe primrose, with the canon's beard, with the gold-cup; come with the\nstone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian\nflora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter\ndaisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to\nembalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt's garden ere\nthe last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious\nsilken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the\nmany-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the\nspring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart,\nfor the two butterflies' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the\nclosed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.\"\n\nThe question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought\nstill to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused\nto believe that he could have been impolite.\n\n\"You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply\ndressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.\" She added\nthat; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally\nrude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing.\nAnd indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the\nattitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a\nfinal uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude\nor action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character; they bear\nno relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our\nsuspicions by the culprit's evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are\nreduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the\nface of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether\nindeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with\nthe result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in\nindicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity.\n\nI dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. \"There\nis a charming quality, is there not,\" he said to me, \"in this silence;\nfor hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read\nin time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow.\nAnd see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which\nyou still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of\nlight, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the\nstillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what\nthe moonlight breathes through the flute of silence.\"\n\nI could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said,\nit sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom\nI had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I\nknew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local\naristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I\nsummoned up all my courage and said to him: \"Tell me, sir, do you, by\nany chance, know the lady--the ladies of Guermantes?\" and I felt glad\nbecause, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over\nit, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an\nobjective existence in the world of spoken things.\n\nBut, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of\nour friend's blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had\nbeen stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils,\nreacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow.\nHis fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been\nstiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and\nsmiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a\ngood-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows.\n\n\"No, I do not know them,\" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a\npiece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could\nastonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have\nbefitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word,\nleaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man\ngives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though\nthe fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some\nstrange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding\nhimself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation,\nchooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the\nconfession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is\neasy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this\ncase the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very\nwell have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin\nhimself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or\nmystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society.\n\n\"No,\" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were\nuttered. \"No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I\nhave always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart,\nas you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me\nabout it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I\nmake myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that's not the\nsort of reputation that can frighten me; it's too true! In my heart\nof hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches,\nbooks--two or three, pictures--rather more, perhaps, and the light of\nthe moon when the fresh breeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my\nnostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp\nenough, now, to distinguish.\"\n\nI did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going\nto the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to\ncling to one's independence, nor how that could give one the appearance\nof a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that\nLegrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only\nfor churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very\ngreat deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much\nafraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he\nwould never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among\nhis friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and\nstockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should\nbe revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment\nshould go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a\nsnob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the\npoetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked\nhim, \"Do you know the Guermantes family?\" Legrandin the talker would\nreply, \"No, I have never cared to know them.\" But unfortunately the\ntalker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully\nhidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because\nthis other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his\nsnobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this\nother Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that\nstiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those\nfew words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had\ninstantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of\nsnobbery:\n\n\"Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not\nremind me of the great sorrow of my life.\" And since this other,\nthis irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our\nLegrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness\nin expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it\nfollowed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he\nwould already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to\ndeplore the bad impression which the revelations of his _alter ego_ must\nhave caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate\nthem.\n\nThis was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he\ninveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least)\nbe aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of\nothers that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out\nabout our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon\nourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which\nsubstitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives,\nless stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness\nimpelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it\nwould set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's\neyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the\nduchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the\nattractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of\nsnobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was\nof their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the\nintervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition\nthe social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause.\n\nAt home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin,\nand our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be\ngreatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which\nhe continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my\nfather, he found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in\nso detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending\nme to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother,\nhe said: \"I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to\nBalbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister.\nHe probably doesn't remember telling us that she lived within a mile of\nthe place.\"\n\nMy grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought\nto be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and\nthat one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties\nand excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights,\nto the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our\nplans; for already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de\nCambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just\nas we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain\nindoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to\nscorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and\nthat Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with\nhis sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to\nintroduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who,\nwithout the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of\nvisiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when\nwe met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne.\n\n\"There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which\nare very beautiful, are they not, my friend?\" he said to my father.\n\"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a\ncineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that\nlittle pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a\ncarnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the\nEnglish Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able\nto find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom\nin the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which\nare still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where\nthe sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which,\nall the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and\ninsignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly\nflower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings,\nincomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade.\nOthers shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still\nto see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals,\nsulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal\nBay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened,\nlike fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast,\nto that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every\nwinter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea.\nBalbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our\nsoil, the true Armor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed region\nwhich Anatole France--an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to\nread--has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were\nindeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they\nare building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and\ncharming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is,\ndown there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and\nso entrancing.\"\n\n\"Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?\" inquired my father. \"This\nyoung man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his\ngrandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.\"\n\nLegrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was\nlooking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so\nconcentrated it with steadily increasing intensity--smiling mournfully\nthe while--upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness\nand frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he\nseemed to have penetrated my father's skull, as it had been a ball of\nglass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it,\na brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and\nwould enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was\nbeing asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking\nof something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these\ntactics make the questioner proceed to ask, \"Why, what are you thinking\nabout?\" But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: \"Have\nyou friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?\"\n\nIn a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled\nto the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and\ndistraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it\nnow but to answer, he said to us: \"I have friends all the world over,\nwherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated,\nwhich have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic\nobstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.\"\n\n\"That is not quite what I meant,\" interrupted my father, obstinate as\na tree and merciless as the sky. \"I asked you, in case anything should\nhappen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all\nalone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the\npeople.\"\n\n\"There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,\" replied\nLegrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; \"places I know\nwell, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem\nto me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality\nwhich would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps\nit is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge; standing there\nby the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before\nan evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing;\nwhile the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of\nthe Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours.\nOr perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if\nanything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some\nimperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which\nknows not truth,\" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, \"that land\nof infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly\nnot what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is\nalready so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed\nto receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and\nfutile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself;\nbut they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still\nunformed. Believe me,\" he went on with emphasis, \"the waters of that\nbay--more Breton than Norman--may exert a sedative influence, though\neven that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no\nlonger unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything\nto compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are\ncontra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,\" he added, moving\naway from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed;\nand then, turning towards us, with a physicianly finger raised in\nwarning, he resumed the consultation: \"No Balbec before you are fifty!\"\nhe called out to me, \"and even then it must depend on the state of the\nheart.\"\n\nMy father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured\nhim with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly\nswindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth\nof skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would\nhave sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative--but an honourable\noccupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have\nconstructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower\nNormandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own\nsister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged\nto offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never\nhave inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain--as,\nfrom his knowledge of my grandmother's character, he really ought to\nhave been certain--that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have\ndreamed of making use of it.\n\n* * *\n\nWe used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt L�onie\na visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when\nthe days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned\ninto the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the\nwindows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary,\nwhich was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which,\naccompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate\nitself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very\nmoment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the\npoetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of\ngood feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the\nhouse, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our\nvisit to aunt L�onie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along\nher window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner\ncurtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and\nscattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay\nwith tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers,\nilluminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting,\nshadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some\ndays, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have\nshed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into\nthe Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning\nalong the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would\nhave lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an\nopalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken\nand broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface, would be lying\nacross it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would\nmake out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me:\n\"Good heavens! There is Fran�oise looking out for us; your aunt must be\nanxious; that means we are late.\"\n\nAnd without wasting time by stopping to take off our 'things' we would\nfly upstairs to my aunt L�onie's room to reassure her, to prove to her\nby our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that,\non the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the\n'Guermantes way,' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew\nwell enough that one could never say at what time one would be home.\n\n\"There, Fran�oise,\" my aunt would say, \"didn't I tell you that they must\nhave gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And\nyour nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours\nit's been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the\nGuermantes way?\"\n\n\"But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,\" Mamma would answer. \"I thought\nthat Fran�oise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the\nkitchen-garden.\"\n\nFor there were, in the environs of Combray, two 'ways' which we used to\ntake for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually\nleave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen:\nthe way towards M�s�glise-la-Vineuse, which we called also 'Swann's\nway,' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M.\nSwann's estate, and the 'Guermantes way.' Of M�s�glise-la-Vineuse, to\ntell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and\nthe strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in\nCombray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would\n'know at all,' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must\nhave come over from M�s�glise.' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well\nenough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole\nof my boyhood, if M�s�glise was to me something as inaccessible as the\nhorizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the\nfolds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the\ncountry round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than\nthe ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the 'Guermantes way,' a\nsort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator.\nAnd so to 'take the Guermantes way' in order to get to M�s�glise, or\nvice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to\nturn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always\nto speak of the 'M�s�glise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain\nthat he knew anywhere, and of the 'Guermantes way' as typical of river\nscenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as\ntwo distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs\nonly to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of\nthem appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special\nexcellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first\nstages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the\nother, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they\nwere set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a\nriver, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen\nplaygoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may\nhappen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between\nthem, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and\ninches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was\nbetween the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one\nof those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which\nseparate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever\nupon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more\nabsolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same\nday, or in the course of the same walk, but the 'M�s�glise way' one time\nand the 'Guermantes way' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart\nand unaware of each other's existence, in the sealed vessels--between\nwhich there could be no communication--of separate afternoons.\n\nWhen we had decided to go the 'M�s�glise way' we would start (without\nundue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was\nnot very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were\nnot going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt's house,\nwhich opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by\nthe gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell\nTh�odore, from Fran�oise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil\nor coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the\nwhite fence of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it we would be met on\nour way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers.\nOut of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised\ninquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple\nblossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which\nthey had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little\ntiled house, called the Archers' Lodge, in which Swann's keeper lived,\novertopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of\nspring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these\nyoung houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid\ncolouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms\nabout their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks\nthat crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without\nstopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's\nmarriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we\nwould, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then\nclimbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in\nthe same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far\nfrom home.\n\nOne day my grandfather said to my 'father: \"Don't you remember Swann's\ntelling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims\nand that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in\nParis? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home;\nthat will make it a little shorter.\"\n\nWe stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some\nof the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny\nballs of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only\na week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam,\nthese were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry\nand scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects\nthe appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had\naltered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day\nof his wife's death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once\nagain, the story of that walk.\n\nIn front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare\nof the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away\ninto the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which\nstood close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by\nSwann's parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is\nthe material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in\nremaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty,\nand will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out'\nscenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human\ninterference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf\nthem, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and\nsuperimposing itself upon the work of man's hands. And so it was that,\nat the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there\nmight be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below\nand of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland\nwhich binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the\niris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out\nover agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered\nglories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake.\n\nThe absence of Mlle. Swann, which--since it preserved me from the\nterrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being\nidentified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had\nBergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals--made\nthe exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a\nmatter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property,\nin my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm,\nand (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to\nmake the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction;\nI should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a\nmiracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we\nshould not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make\nher acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying\nforgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing\nin the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather\nlooking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after\nall, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not,\nreally, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the\nhouse, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a\nfootstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the\ntall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately\nattempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long,\ncontinuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it\nreceived at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of\nsilence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested\nfor all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more\nquickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was\nnaturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and\neven the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by\nthe insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt,\nof some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight\nof that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at\nfull speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost\nvertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and\nI had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the\nterror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my\nduty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting--when I was obliged\nto run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were\nsurprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing\nup hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I\nfound the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom.\nThe hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer\nvisible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their\naltars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the\nground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent\nthat swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in\nits range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and\nthe flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of\nglittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves'\nin the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church,\nframed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery\nof the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like\nstrawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with\nthese, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be\nclimbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the\nsmooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and\nscattered by the first breath of wind.\n\nBut it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in,\nto marshal before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose\nin order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb\nmyself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with\nthe light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as\ncertain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation\nof the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting\nme delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play\nover a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their\nsecret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return\nto them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which,\noutside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed\nand been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen\nlazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their\nflowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals\nhints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself;\ninfrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us\nthat we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse\nof waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single\npoppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze\nits scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it\nsprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives, upon\nsome low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and\nmade seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of\nit, \"The Sea!\"\n\nAnd then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands\nbefore those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will\nbe better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at\nsomething else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as\nto have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which\nthey aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing\nto free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They\nthemselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any\nother flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring\nme with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite\npainter quite different from any of those that we already know, or,\nbetter still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a\npicture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch,\nor when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano\nbursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an\norchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge\nof Tansonville, said: \"You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink\none; isn't it pretty?\"\n\nAnd it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and\nlovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of\nthose days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion,\nbecause they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular\nholidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for\nsuch observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially\nfestal--but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the\nflowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to\nleave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about\nthe crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,'\nand consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of\nCombray, to the 'plain,' if one was to judge by the scale of prices\nat the 'stores' in the Square, or at Camus's, where the most expensive\nbiscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a\nhigher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed\nto tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen\nprecisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some\nexquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival, which colours,\ninasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those\nwhose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that\nreason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other\ntints, even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no\ngratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the\ndressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before\nthe white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no\nartificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal\nintention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself\nwho had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from\na village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some\nprocession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too\nravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches,\nlike so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets\nof paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on\nthe greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler\nin colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of\npink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly\nthan the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the\nhawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to\nblossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place\nin the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday\nattire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying\nat home, equipped and ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed\nalready to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments,\na Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful.\n\nThe hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered\nwith jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open\ntheir fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old\nSpanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted\ngreen, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the\nflowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan\nof infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable\nto move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our\neyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes\npossession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish\nhair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her\nhand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish\nfreckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know,\nand indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective\nelements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough\n'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long\ntime afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright\neyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her\ncomplexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been\nquite so black--which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting\nher--I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their\nimagined blue.\n\nI gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger\nfrom the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out,\npetrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture,\nbear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the\nbody; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and\nfather, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by\nmaking me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously\nappealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to\nsee, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take\nstock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she\nformed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away\nwith an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to\nspare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of\nvision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had\novertaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space\nthat lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression,\nwithout appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden\nsmile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I\nhad received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite\ndisgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an\nindelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a\nperson whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which\nI carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate\ninsult.\n\n\"Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?\" called out in a piercing\ntone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that\nmoment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen\n'ducks,' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed\nto be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded,\nand, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in\nmy direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.\n\nAnd so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a\ntalisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom\nits syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a\nmoment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came\nto me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and\ncool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating\nand irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which\nit set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the\nlife of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that\nlived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the\narch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder,\nthe quintessence of their familiarity--so exquisitely painful to\nmyself--with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into\nwhich I should never penetrate.\n\nFor a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor\nSwann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so\nthat she can be left alone with her Charlus--for that was Charlus: I\nrecognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up\nin all that!\") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which\nGilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting\nher to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not\nbeing indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat,\nrevived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon\nthat love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated\nheart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down\nto its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the\ninspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep\nsome memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have\nliked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and\nshout, \"I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!\"\nHowever, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards,\nas the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible\nto a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was\nimpossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish\nhair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in\nher hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and\ninexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a\ncloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through\nwhich she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to\nconquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had\nany association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably\nfortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even\nthe melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elys�es, where she lived in\nParis.\n\n\"L�onie,\" said my grandfather on our return, \"I wish we had had you with\nus this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had\nthe courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used\nto like so much.\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk,\neither just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope\nthat she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of\ndoors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and,\nmoreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to\nreceive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the\nworld. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for\nher (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would\nask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment\nand resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time,\nso, this evening, she said to my grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the\nweather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.\"\nAnd in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see\nSwann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all\nthat remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more\nthan exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more\nenergetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had\nreached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on\nreturning to her bed. The process which had begun in her--and in her a\nlittle earlier only than it must come to all of us--was the great and\ngeneral renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the\nchrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been\nunduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with\nthe utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest\nties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the\nnecessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease\nto correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this\nworld. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not\nsee Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but\nthis ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more\nreadiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made\nit more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by\nthe gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to\nmeasure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to\nher if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the\nblessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n\nMy aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all\nhours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was\nnot going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to\nTansonville, trying to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and\ngrandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods.\nThe name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann--when I\ntalked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them\nutter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a\ndiscussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in\nwhich she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too\nremotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father\n(by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business\nhad been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink\nhawthorn which my aunt L�onie wished to visit was on common ground) to\ncorrect my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his\nown accord: \"No, no, the business belonged to _Swann's_ father, that\nhedge is part of _Swann's_ park.\" And then I would be obliged to pause\nfor breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it\nwas for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard\nit, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because\nit was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had\nsecretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was\nashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it\nthat to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity\nof effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure\nin the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by\na scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had\nstored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it\nwas uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could\nnot fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves\nsharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they\ncondoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as\nwretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their\nhearts.\n\nThat year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather\nearlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my\nhair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat\ncarefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket;\na little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me\nstanding in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville,\nbidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches\nto my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight\nof all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious\nhand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all\nmy hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I\nhad torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at\nall moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of\nmy battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her.\n\"Oh, my poor little hawthorns,\" I was assuring them through my sobs, \"it\nis not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you.\nYou, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.\" And,\ndrying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy\nthe foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring\ndays, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make\nexcursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.\n\nOnce in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our\nM�s�glise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible\nstreams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of\nCombray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I\nreally was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again\nthrough my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always\nhad the wind for companion when one went the 'M�s�glise way,' on\nthat swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any\ndisturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often\nto go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many\nmiles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening\nobstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge\nfrom the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant\nfields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally\nsettling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my\nfeet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us\ntogether, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed\nby her also, that there was some message from her in what it was\nwhispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would\ncatch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu\n(_Campus Pagani_, according to the Cur�). On my right I could see\nacross the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of\nSaint-Andr�-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated,\nhoneycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.\n\nAt regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their\nleaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the\napple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging\nin shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going\nthe 'M�s�glise way' that I first noticed the circular shadow which\napple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable\nthreads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards\nfrom beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through\nwith his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path.\n\nSometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little\ncloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have\nto 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary\nclothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the\nbackground, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to\nfind her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of\nart were very different--at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had\nattuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies--from those in\nwhich the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have\nrecognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine,\nsome landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the\nsky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and\nas incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it\nenraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. They held that one\nought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate\ngood taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would\ncontinue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt\nthey regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded\nvision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their\nequivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's\nheart.\n\nIt was along the 'M�s�glise way,' at Montjouvain, a house built on the\nedge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that\nM. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her\ndogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never\nsaw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than\nherself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end\ninstalled herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said:\n\"That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone\nis talking about, and to let his daughter--a man who is horrified if you\nuse a word in the wrong sense--bring a woman like that to live under his\nroof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold,\nand that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had\nonly been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching\nhis daughter.\" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed\nit is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their\nnormal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in\nphysical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly\ndecried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them\nof unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine\nresplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud\nvoice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the\npart of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted,\nwithout in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite\nunmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make\nthe Cur� and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh\nvoice: \"What d'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with\nher friend, Mlle. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know\nnothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about\nit yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that\ngirl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a\nchild; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too,\nwith his daughter's friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular\nmusical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say\nthey've been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil\nthe other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his\nfeet.\"\n\nAnyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time,\navoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught\nsight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a\nsea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting\nhis daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave,\ncould hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a\nbroken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to\nthe rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed,\nwhat his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid\nhis virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of\ncircumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which\nhe himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first\nrecognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his\npresence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the\nunaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand\nreasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must\nhave been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have\nto resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed\nto occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there\nneeds to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a\nvice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by\nno more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might\nblend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil\nmay have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his\nadoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to\nthe sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that\nengendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they\ncan aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without\nweakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one\nafter another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not\nmake it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of\nits physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself\nfrom the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he\nattempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied\nin the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give\njudgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely\nthe terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his\ndaughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the\nvery 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late\nbeen tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked\nabove him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they\nmight hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of\nrising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any\nhuman misfortune.\n\nOne day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of\nCombray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so\nsuddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and\nSwann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who,\namid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's\nshame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the\noutward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of\nthe bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him\nupon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil,\nwith whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and\ninvited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day,\nto play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier,\nwould have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much\ngratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion\nof accepting. Swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to\nbe in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he\nfelt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the\nwholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.\n\n\"What a charming man!\" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the\nsame enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the\nmiddle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a\nduchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. \"What a charming man! What\na pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!\"\n\nAnd then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most\nsincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the\nopinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer\nthere, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann's marriage,\ninvoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they\ninvoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good\nfellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way\ninfringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit\nSwann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly,\nafter meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning\nfor a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself,\none of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined\nthat he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil\nshould appear with his daughter at Tansonville.\n\nSince the 'M�s�glise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to\ntake for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for\ndays of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of M�s�glise\nshewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the\nfringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for\nshelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.\n\nOften the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its\nroundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness,\nthough not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape\nin which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village\nof Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its\ngables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from\nits perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while\nbeneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of\nblue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still\nfind decorating the walls of old houses.\n\nBut on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due\nwarning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung\nout in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a\nbody at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching\norder. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in\ntheir rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw\nafter it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly\ndarkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the\ntrees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last\ndrops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we\nwould emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now,\namong the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a\nstray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and\nhang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump\nupon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.\n\nOften, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony\nsaints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-Andr�-des-Champs, How\ntypically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings\nof chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals\nwere carved as they might have been in the mind of Fran�oise. The\nsculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil,\nprecisely as Fran�oise in her kitchen would break into speech about\nSaint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to\ndepreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered\nless 'righteous.' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval\nartist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in\nthe nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history,\nideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were\nderived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct,\nunbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray\nperson whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic\nsculptures of Saint-Andr�-des-Champs was young Th�odore, the assistant\nin Camus's shop. And, indeed, Fran�oise herself was well aware that she\nhad in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill\nfor Fran�oise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry\nher to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs\nand, perhaps, 'make an impression' on my aunt, she would send out for\nTh�odore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town\nas a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served\nto decorate the porch of Saint-Andr�-des-Champs, and particularly in the\nfeelings of respect due, in Fran�oise eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and,\nabove all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down\nto raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of pr�rapha�lite\nsimplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who\nthrong, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as\nthough those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter,\nwere, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower\nagain in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of\nTh�odore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.\n\nThere, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but\ndetached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her\npedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her\nfeet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full\ncheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like\na cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and\nstubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous\nexpression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which\nimparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to\nfind in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from\nthe fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose\npresence there--as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up\nbeside leaves carved in stone--seemed intended by fate to allow us, by\nconfronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate\nof the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a\npromised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had\nnever penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for\nus, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by\nall the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down\nobliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already\nreceived the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the\nlight of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the\nrays of a monstrance upon an altar.\n\nSometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go\nhome and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in\na landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere,\nresembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower\nslopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone\nout like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at\nanchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm?\nIn summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial\nill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very\ndifferent thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter,\nits very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the\nsoil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over\nwhich the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance\noffered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them\nflying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of\nthe houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white.\nSitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner\nwith a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees,\nbut I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the\ngreenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves\nhad undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the\nrainy night, to assure me of the fine weather's continuing; it might\nrain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville,\nthere would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little\nheart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the\npoplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation\nbefore the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end\nof the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.\n\nIf the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of\na walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit\nof going out by myself on such days, and walking towards\nM�s�glise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray\nto settle the division of my aunt L�onie's estate; for she had died at\nlast, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the\nfact of her demise--those who had insisted that her mode of life was\nenfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had\nalways maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary,\nbut organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would\nbe obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it;\ncausing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that\none a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my\naunt's last illness Fran�oise never went out of her room for an instant,\nnever took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my\naunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave.\nThen, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Fran�oise\nhad lived of my aunt's harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had\ndeveloped in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which\nwas really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it\nhad been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been\nso hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take\nadvantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no\nmore. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The\ntime had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays\nat Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Fran�oise eyes, with my\naunt.\n\nDuring that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with\nthe legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with\nsolicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it\nhappened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them,\nalong the 'M�s�glise way,' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which\nprotected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw\nover my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan\nscandalised Fran�oise, whom it was impossible to convince that the\ncolour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning\nfor the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's\ndeath was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the\nneighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone\nwhen we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I\nam sure that in a book--and to that extent my feelings were closely akin\nto those of Fran�oise--such a conception of mourning, in the manner\nof the _Chanson de Roland_ and of the porch of Saint-Andr�-des-Champs,\nwould have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Fran�oise herself\napproached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry,\nand I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I\nregretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of\nher absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that\nshe might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her\ndeath would not have caused me a moment's sorrow; statements which, in a\nbook, would have struck me as merely fatuous.\n\nAnd if Fran�oise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused\nreflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to\nplead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: \"I don't know how to\n_espress_ myself\"--I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal\ncommon sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: \"All the same\nshe was a _geological_ relation; there is always the respect due to your\n_geology_,\" I would shrug my shoulders and say: \"It is really very good\nof me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot\nspeak her own language,\" adopting, to deliver judgment on Fran�oise,\nthe mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most\ncontemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too\nprone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage\nof life.\n\nMy walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used\nto take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of\nreading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid\nacross my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of\nenforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was\nnow obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in\nevery direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees\nof Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its\nback, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must\nhear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than\nexpressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not\nbeing developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the\nlight of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course\nof elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an\nimmediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the\nemotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us\nof the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in\nan indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted.\nWhen I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the 'M�s�glise way,' all\nthe humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or\nthe direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same\nautumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded\nMontjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by\nthis lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of\nexpression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a\nbrisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached\na little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil's gardener kept\nhis tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean\nby the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall\nof the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken\nperching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass\nthat grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which\nthings let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent,\nwith the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The\ntiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again\nin the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never\nobserved before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the\nwall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my\nenthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: \"Damn, damn, damn, damn!\"\nBut at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content\nmyself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more\nclearly into the sources of my enjoyment.\n\nAnd it was at that moment, too--thanks to a peasant who went past,\napparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly\nreceived my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality\nto my \"Fine day, what! good to be out walking!\"--that I learned\nthat identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men\nsimultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that,\nwhenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the\nfriend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment\nhave finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and\nwanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been\nthinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and\nproper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using\nthe same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already\nforgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself\nupon them with a kiss.\n\nSometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be\nadded an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to\nwhich I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire\nto see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my\narms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately\nto its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure\nwhich accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was\ngiven me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything\nthat was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled\nroof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into\nwhich I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the\nsteeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made\nthem appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that\nhad provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly\ntowards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and\npropitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added\nfor me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their\nturn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much\nrestricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers\nalso, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of\nRoussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her\nkiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing\nstrength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding\nthrough all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any\nbounds. Moreover--just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature,\nthe normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas\nof things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the\noriginality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may\nhappen to be--the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be\nnot any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and\nnatural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not\nmyself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious,\nmore important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear\nto full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made\nno distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from M�s�glise or\nRoussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for\nBalbec and M�s�glise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to\ngive me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in\nit any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I\nchose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from\nM�s�glise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which\nI had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found\namong the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was\nabout to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my\nimagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of\nRoussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods\nand yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty.\nThat girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their\nleaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the\nrest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely\nthan in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had\nsprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that\nthe caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were\nthemselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could\nnever derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long\nremain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact\nof this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has\ntasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one\nregard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that\nis always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and\nformulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one\nseeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in\nanticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself,\nbut only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and\nconcealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it\nmakes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender\nglance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more\nthan anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of\nheart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves,\nwhich we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon\nus.\n\nAlas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville,\nthat I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village,\nappealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my\nearliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from\nthe little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen\nnothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window,\nwhile, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for\nunknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of\nself-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of\nmy own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to\nmy death, even--until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among\nthe sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window,\ntumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I\ncompressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with\nan exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I\nmight go alone as far as the porch of Saint-Andr�-des-Champs: never did\nI find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with\nmy grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix\nmy eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from\nbehind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny\nleft the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope\nnow would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it\nthe creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale\nand outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with\nsullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from\namong which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they\nhad been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama,\nwhen, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having\nheld in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to\nretrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance\nof her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had\nappeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have\nregarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came\nto me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others,\nor as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more\nnow than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my\ntemperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the\nworld of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and\nsignificance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional\nframework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway\ncarriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.\n\nAnd it is perhaps from another impression which I received at\nMont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was\nwithout meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that\ncruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due\ncourse, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was\nto play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot\nweather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day,\nhad told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having\ngone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the\nreflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade\nand gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up\nbehind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before,\none day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark\nwhen I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mlle. Vinteuil\n(or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her\noften at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas\nshe was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in,\nstanding in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room\nin which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made\ninto a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the\nlamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being\nable to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound\namong the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I\nhad been hiding there in order to spy upon her.\n\nShe was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had\nnot gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that\nvirtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence--namely,\nmodesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My\nmother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete\nabsorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his\ndaughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she\ncould see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old\nman's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely\nabandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later\nwork, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a\nretired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value\nin themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such\ngreat value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he\nsacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even\nwritten down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were\nscribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain\nunknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more\ncruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing\nthe girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when\nshe called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come\nupon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and\nshuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness,\nwhich Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having\nvirtually killed her father. \"Poor M. Vinteuil,\" my mother would say,\n\"he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting\nhis reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only\ncome to him from her.\"\n\nAt the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece,\nstood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch,\njust as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside,\nthen flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little\ntable on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil\nhad 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked\nto play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil\ngreeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and\ndrew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no\nsooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps\nsuggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which\nmight well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would\nprefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair;\nshe felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright;\nstretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her\neyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep,\nand that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude\nand hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could\nrecognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt\nscruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently\nshe rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to\nclose the shutters and not succeeding.\n\n\"Leave them open,\" said her friend. \"I am hot.\"\n\n\"But it's too dreadful! People will see us,\" Mlle. Vinteuil answered.\nAnd then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had\nuttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other\nwords, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from\nprudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although\nI could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression\nmust have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so\ndelightful, when she hastily went on: \"When I say 'see us' I mean, of\ncourse, see us reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial\nlittle thing you do some one may be overlooking you.\"\n\nWith the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her\ncontrol, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had\nfelt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And\nperpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden\nwould kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but\ntriumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.\n\n\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at\nthis time of night in this densely populated district!\" said her friend,\nwith bitter irony. \"And what if they are?\" she went on, feeling bound\nto annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which\nshe was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand\nwhich, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. \"And what if\nthey are? All the better that they should see us.\"\n\nMlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive\nand scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow,\nspontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her\neager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the\nlimitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to\na vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the\nwords which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with\nsincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed\nherself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained\ntimidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while\nshe kept on interrupting herself with: \"You're sure you aren't cold? You\naren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself?...\n\n\"Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,\" she\nconcluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on\nsome earlier occasion, by her friend.\n\nIn the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the\nsting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and\nran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room,\nscrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like\nwings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle.\nVinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from\nme by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back\nturned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had\nbeen arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see\nit unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she\nherself had just noticed it for the first time: \"Oh! there's my father's\npicture looking at us; I can't think who can have put it there; I'm sure\nI've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.\"\n\nI remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in\napologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of\ncourse, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to\ndaily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently\na liturgical response: \"Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any\nlonger. D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out\nof the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old\nmonkey?\"\n\nTo which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \"Oh, please!\"--a gentle reproach\nwhich testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it\nwas prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this\nfashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself,\nby a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such\nmoments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all\nappearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which\nher friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been,\ntoo, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these\nblasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her\nfrank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form\nof that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to\nadopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with\naffection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards\nthe defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held\nout a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done\nto her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between\nthem, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M.\nVinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred\nrights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl's head in her hands and\nplaced a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection\nshe had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what\ndistraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.\n\n\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\" she said,\ntaking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something\nthat I could not distinguish.\n\n\"Oh! You would never dare.\"\n\n\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\" shouted the friend with deliberate\nbrutality.\n\nI heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,\npreoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew\nthe shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil,\nin return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on\naccount of his daughter, had received from her after his death.\n\nAnd yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be\npresent at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have\ncontinued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he\nmight even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true\nthat in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so\nstrong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it\nexhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a\n'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under\nthe homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a\ngirl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has\nlived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in\nreal life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic'\ninstinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being\nin the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the\nsame outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and\ndefying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them\ndeliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking\nin subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less\nevident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have\nadmitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in\nMlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element\nwas probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil,\nwhich a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil\nwould not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her,\nand would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for\nvirtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never\nhave practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious\ndelight in their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are\ncreatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even\nsensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved\nfor the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it\nthey endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of\nwicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain\nthe momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own\ngentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And\nI could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I\nrealised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when\nshe wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at\nonce suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of\nthe poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she\nreally desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures,\nbut what remained between them and her and prevented her from any\ndirect enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his\nmother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to\nbe kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations\nwhich set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a\nphraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it\nas not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and\ncourtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil\nthat gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it\nwas pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she\nindulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as,\nordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to\nsee in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil.\nPerhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether\nbad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous\nutterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses\non her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin\nin their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have\nbeen discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness\nand long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was\nable to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed\namusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a\ngirl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy\ntowards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of\nwickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was\nso refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself,\nas in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings\nwhich they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one\ntrue, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.\n\nIf the 'M�s�glise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when\nwe took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must\nmake sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a\nspell of fine days, when Fran�oise, in desperation that not a drop was\nfalling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there\nonly a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure\nsurface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: \"You would say they were nothing\nmore nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their\nsnouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor\nlabourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come,\nrattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling\nthan if it was on the sea!\"--when my father's appeals to the gardener\nhad met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession,\nthen some one would say, at dinner: \"To-morrow, if the weather holds,\nwe might go the Guermantes way.\" And off we would set, immediately after\nluncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue\ndes Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots\nover which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street\nas quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its\npersonality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search\nin vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises\nupon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects,\npupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath\na Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a\nNorman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably\nwas in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice\nstanding, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And\nfor such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance\nthan is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it\nhas preserved--perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon\nto follow the rest into oblivion--of what Combray looked like in my\nchildhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray\nthat traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as\nmoving--if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works,\nreproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me--as\nthose old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile\nBellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist,\nthe masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's.\n\nWe would pass, in the Rue de l'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the\nOiseau Flesch�, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would\nrumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes,\nand de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some\nlitigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would\ncome at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the\nsteeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down\nand spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for\nit was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you\nwould have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that\nit relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the\nindolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do,\nhad simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops\nwhich had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed,\nat a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.\n\nThe great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us,\nalmost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten\nminutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux.\nAnd every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the\nsermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the\ndisorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous\npreparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they\nhave not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river\nflowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its\nonly companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few\nprimroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue\nflame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of\nperfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which,\nat this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a\nhazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken\nroot. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the\nblacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform\nor chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was\nnever able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to\nraise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the\npoint of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be\nquiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which\nran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The\nground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad\nmeadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station.\nOver these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of\nthe castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages,\nhad had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence\nagainst attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville.\nNothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad\nsurface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in\ntheir day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out\nover Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt,\nfiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked;\nbut fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and\ncommanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there\nin their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past\nthat had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by\nthe water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong\nfood for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the\nlittle town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different,\nseizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible\nfeatures which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups.\nFor the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had\nchosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in\nwhole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added\nlustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate\nthe pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would\nlet it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until\nit had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of\nabsolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest\nchildhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards\nthem, before even I could pronounce their charming name--a name fit for\nthe Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far\ndistant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village,\nwell satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine\nand the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the\nrailway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old\npaintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the\ngolden East.\n\nI would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used\nto lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the\ncurrent of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at\nonce 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water\nand 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid,\nflowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more\nprovoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing\nupon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight\nbetween the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and\nthe insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided\nthat I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for\nand obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into\nthe Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a\nchemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about\nthem in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no\ndoubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter\nthe stage of crystallisation.\n\nPresently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants.\nAt first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current,\nacross whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest\nfor a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it\nwould drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally\nrepeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would\nbe straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until\nthe current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their\nanchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called\nits starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before\nmoving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after\nanother, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims\nof neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt\nL�onie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle\nof their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine\nthemselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always\nretain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and\neccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate\nits mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange,\nineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily,\nand also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated\nindefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who\nwould have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from\nthe victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him\nto hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.\n\nBut farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a\nproperty thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of\naquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was\nhere diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this\npoint were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a\nbackground which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we\nwere coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen\nin its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a\nfloor of Japanese cloisonn�. Here and there, on the surface, floated,\nblushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of\nwhite petals.\n\nBeyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy,\nmore thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in\nfestoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream,\nas though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some\nWatteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner\nseemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or\nwhite like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely\ncare; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together\nin a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden\nlike butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over\nthe transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border\nalso, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious,\nmore moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled\nbeneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless,\nand alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven\nwith the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and\never remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the\nflowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and\nmystery--with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it\nseemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.\n\nAfter leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly.\nHow often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free\nto live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched\nout on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it\ndrift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly\nabove him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace.\n\nWe would sit down among the irises at the water's edge. In the holiday\nsky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed\nby the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with\nan anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards\nwe would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and\nchocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint,\nbut solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire,\nwhich had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed\nto traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all\ntheir sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.\n\nSometimes, at the water's edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon\na house of the kind called 'pleasure houses,' isolated and lost, seeing\nnothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young\nwoman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local\norigin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to\nbury herself,' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name,\nand still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had\nbeen unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from\nwhich she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her\ndoor. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard,\nthrough the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom,\nbefore they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they\nknown, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their\npast lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have\noccasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had\nwillingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been\nable to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And\nI watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had\nknown that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long\ngloves of a precious, useless charm.\n\nNever, in the course of our walks along the 'Guermantes way,' might\nwe penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often\nthought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I\nhad been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually\nto be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from\nCombray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was\nanother fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface, where, according\nto the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that\nother goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I\nknew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse\nde Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually\nexist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself\neither in tapestry, as was the 'Coronation of Esther' which hung in our\nchurch, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in\nhis window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my\nfingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row\nof chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Genevi�ve\nde Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern\nsent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the\nceiling--in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age,\nand bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the\nresounding syllable 'antes.' And if, in spite of that, they were for\nme, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of\nan unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously\ndistended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes\nof which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit 'Guermantes way'\nof our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its\novershadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons.\nAnd I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de\nGuermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain\nattempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied\nthemselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first\ncitizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among\nits citizens who did not reside in it--Comtes de Combray, possessing\nCombray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it\nin their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that\nstrange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors\nof the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling,\npresumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like\nthat Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of\nthe apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer,\nif I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus's for a\npacket of salt.\n\nAnd then it happened that, going the 'Guermantes way,' I passed\noccasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges\nrose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain\nsome precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my\neyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much\nto see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my\nfavourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its\nimagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that\nGuermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I\nheard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and\nfountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream\nthat Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself,\ninvited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my\nside. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by\nthe little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers\nthat leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls,\nand would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all\nabout the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me\nthat, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to\ndecide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked\nmyself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I\ncould impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind\nwould stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would\nfeel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a\nmalady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would\ndepend upon my father's arranging everything for me. He was so powerful,\nin such favour with the people who 'really counted,' that he made it\npossible for us to transgress laws which Fran�oise had taught me to\nregard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we\nwere allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the\nwalls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris,\nor when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat's\nson, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two\nmonths before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began\nwith 'A,' instead of having to wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen\nseriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my\nfather's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that\nhis letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my\nillness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which\nthere was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited\nwith perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable\nrealities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health.\nPerhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind\nwhen I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no\nmore, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to\nan end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the\nGovernment and with Providence that I should be the first writer of\nmy day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient\nat seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life,\ninstead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he\ncould modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in\na larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose\njudgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound,\nhelpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further\npossibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in\nthe same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die\nlike them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one\nof those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I\nrenounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been\ngiven me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the\nnullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches\nthat might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud\nin the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of\nconscience.\n\nOne day my mother said: \"You are always talking about Mme. de\nGuermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was\nill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's\nwedding. You will be able to see her in church.\" It was from Dr.\nPercepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de\nGuermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper\nin which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy\ndress ball given by the Princesse de L�on.\n\nSuddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side,\nenabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a\nlarge nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy\nand new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And\nbecause on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had\nbeen very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible,\ndetails which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because,\nmore especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady,\nif I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the\nsame terms:--_a large nose, blue eyes_, as Dr. Percepied had used when\ndescribing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself:\n\"This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes.\" Now the chapel from\nwhich she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath\nits flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb,\nrested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having\nheard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family,\nwhenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there\nwas, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes\nwho on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there,\ncould be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was\nimmense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of\nMme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of\na tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being\nof another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken\ninto account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme.\nSazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of\npeople whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my\nmind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative\nprinciple, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps\nnot substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in\nignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain\ntype of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and\ntradesmen. \"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\" were\nthe words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with\nwhich I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no\nresemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de\nGuermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like\nthe others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for\nthe first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was\nnot of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others\nthat allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous\nsyllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery\nlittle spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her\nsubjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the\nstage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger,\nindicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes,\nwhereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely\nat a projection of limelight from a lantern.\n\nMeanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent\nnose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision\n(perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the\nfirst impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder\nwhether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de\nGuermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: \"It is Mme. de\nGuermantes\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and\nthe image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes,\nwith a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often\ndreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent\nof myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination,\nwhich, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different\nfrom anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me:\n\"Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes\nhad the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de\nGuermantes descends from Genevi�ve de Brabant. She does not know, nor\nwould she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.\"\n\nAnd then--oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the\nhuman face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray,\nalone, as far as it may choose--while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the\nchapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here\nand wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested\nupon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray\nof sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared\nconscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since\nshe remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to\nnotice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course\nof their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was\nimpossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the\nvagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.\n\nI felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before\nI had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for\nyears past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be\ndesired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her\nI should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later\nreference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red\ncheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious,\nauthentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now\nthat, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face--and\nespecially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct\nof self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in\nourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived--I found\nonly beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the\nsame person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes\nwhom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape)\napart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight,\npure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound\nher, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation\nround me: \"She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat\" or \"than Mlle.\nVinteuil,\" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And\nmy gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her\nneck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of\nthe faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this\ndeliberately unfinished sketch: \"How lovely she is! What true nobility!\nit is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Genevi�ve de Brabant,\nthat I have before me!\" And the care which I took to focus all my\nattention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that\nto-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible\nto visualise any single person who was present except her, and the\nbeadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the\nlady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite\nclearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the\nsacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy\nday, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all\nthose Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose\ninferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in\nreturn, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might\ncount on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and\nnatural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the\ndeliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs,\nin a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague\nthoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light\nwhich she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in\nany way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom\nthat current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see\nagain to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle\nastonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to\naddress it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his\nshare of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to\nbe making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves.\nThis smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with\nmy eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me\nduring the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the\nwindow of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, \"Of course, she is thinking\nabout me.\" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she\nwould continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would,\nperhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account.\nAnd at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to\nmake us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed\nMlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours,\nit is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de\nGuermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her\neyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet\ndedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind\na threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the\nSquare and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet\nlaid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly\nadvanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a\nbloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness\nin the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages\nof _Lohengrin_, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand\nhow Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet\n'delicious.'\n\nHow often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the\n'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect\non my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must\nabandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I\nfelt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself,\nmade me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of\nits own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased\nentirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on\nwhich my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart\nfrom all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment\nto anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a\nstone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the\nspecial pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they\nappeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something\nwhich they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which,\ndespite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the\nmysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front\nof them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with\nmy mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten\nafter my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to\nrecover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon\nrecalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which,\nwithout my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming,\nready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were\nthemselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any\nimpression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost\nof succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them\nwas associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual\nvalue, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an\nunreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and\nin that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own\nimpotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme\nfor some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my\nconscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour--to strive\nfor a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never\nlong in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an\neffort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck\nwould have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the\nmoment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my\nresearches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter\nuntil I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no\npurpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay\nhidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was\ntaking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering,\nbeneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days\nwhen I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my\nbasket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once\nin the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my\nmind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had\ngathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me)\nwith a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a\nroof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass\nof different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality\nof which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the\nenergy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had\nprolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very\nglad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening,\nDr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and\nrecognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an\nimpression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first\nsubjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set\non the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because\nthe Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at\nMartinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked\nus to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that\nspecial pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught\nsight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was\nplaying, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road\nseemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a\nthird steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them\nby a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the\ndistance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.\n\nIn ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes\nof aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not\npenetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay\nbehind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at\nonce to contain and to conceal.\n\nThe steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so\nlittle nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we\ndrew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for\nthe pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and\nthe business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me\nirksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging\nlines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of\nthem no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples\nwould have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and\nscents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the\nobscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring\nthem more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we\nwere waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I\nclimbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more,\nat my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse\nat a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for\nconversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged,\nin default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to\nrecapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and\ntheir sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were\nstripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became\napparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a\nmoment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure\nwith which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much\nenhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer\nthink of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled\na long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them\nagain, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few\nminutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they\nshewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.\n\nWithout admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of\nMartinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it\nwas in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to\nme, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed,\nin spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to\nsatisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since\ndiscovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and\nthere.\n\nAlone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in\nthat expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of\nMartinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting\nthem by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq,\nwas come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and\nyet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like\nthree birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in\nthe sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper\ndistance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by\nthe light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could\nsee playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in\napproaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse\nbefore we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having\nturned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung\nthemselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop\nbefore being dashed against the porch of the church.\n\nWe resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and\nthe village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already\ndisappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight,\nits steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of\nfarewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw,\nso that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road\nchanged direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots,\nand vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already\nclose to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them\nfor the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers\npainted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think,\ntoo, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over\nwhich night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a\ngallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some\nawkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close\nto one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more,\nnow, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and\nresigned, and so vanishing in the night.\n\nI never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my\ncorner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit\nof placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville\nmarket, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness,\nfelt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the\nsteeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I\nmyself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top\nof my voice.\n\nAll day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the\npleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de\nGuermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the\nVivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in\nsuch moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous\nafternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on\nthe left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were\nthemselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need\nonly turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of\norchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees\nwhich cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun,\nthe Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would\nbegin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at\nhome, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the\n'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than\nusual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so\nthat my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to\ndinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone\nof melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other\nzone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as\nsometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line\ninvisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird\nflying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it,\nenters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just\nnow been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of\nhappiness--I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would\nhave afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them\nall, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma!\nShuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my\nmother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where\nI could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that\nI were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when,\nthe rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might\nlean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which\nclambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run\ndown at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening\nmust return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so\nit was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between\nthese states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain\nperiods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one\nreturning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and\nague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means\nof communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to\nmyself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the\nother.\n\nSo the 'M�s�glise way' and the 'Guermantes way' remain for me linked\nwith many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives\nalong whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in\nsudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of\nthe mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the\ntruths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have\nopened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for\ntheir discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us\nthose truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became\napparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water\nwhich rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as\nenvironment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still\nwith its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were\nslowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming\nchild--as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the\ncrowd--that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose\nthat it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in\nall their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which\nstrays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the\ndog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no\necho, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by\nthe current, and formed only to burst--my exaltation of mind has borne\nthem with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these\nsuccessive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have\nvanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of\nthose who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment\nof landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in\nsuch isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my\nmind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from\nwhat place, from what time--perhaps, quite simply, from which of my\ndreams--it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my\nmental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard\nthe M�s�glise and Guermantes 'ways.' It is because I used to think of\ncertain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that\nthe things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone,\nI still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith\nwhich creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape\nin the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the\nfirst time never seem to me to be true flowers. The 'M�s�glise way'\nwith its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its\napple-trees, the 'Guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles, its\nwater-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time\nthe picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my\nonly requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat,\nsee the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among\nthe cornfields--as Saint-Andr�-des-Champs lay hidden--an old church,\nmonumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers,\nthe hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to\nencounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on\nthe level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And\nyet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am\nseized with a desire to see again the 'Guermantes way,' it would not\nbe satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies\nas fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my\nreturn home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that\nanguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of\nlove, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have\nwished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me,\nthough she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No:\njust as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that\nuntroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able\nto give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes\nin them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her\nkiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation,\nunburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my\nmother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which\nthere was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish,\nand which I loved as much as all the rest--so what I want to see again\nis the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little\napart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the\nentrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it\nis polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined\nthe leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality\nsometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost\nfantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.\n\nNo doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in\nme groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had\nmade me feel several separate things at the same time, the M�s�glise\nand Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much\ndisillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to\nsee a person again without realising that it was simply because that\nperson recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been\nled to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of\naffection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by\nthe same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions,\nto-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to\nthose impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the\nrest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for\nme alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a\ntawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the\n'M�s�glise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling,\nthrough the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent\nlilac-trees.\n\nAnd so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at\nCombray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days\nbesides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the\ntaste--by what would have been called at Combray the 'perfume'---of a\ncup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many\nyears after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love\naffair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that\naccuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are\nstudying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when\nwe are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an\naccuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible\nto speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance\nby which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories,\nfollowing one after another, were condensed into a single substance,\nbut had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the\nthree strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others,\ninspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume,' and those which were\nactually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at\nsecond hand--no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least\nthose veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain\nmarbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.\n\nIt is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the\nbrief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I\nwas actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in\nthe darkness, and--fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the\nassistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed\nthe curtains and the window--would have reconstructed it complete and\nwith its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working\nupon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have\nreplaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed\nsite. 'But scarcely had daylight itself--and no longer the gleam from\na last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for\ndaylight--traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across\na blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with\nits curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had\nerroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table,\nwhich my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would\nhurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and\nsweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would\nbe enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had\nlain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the\ndarkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I\nhad caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight\nby that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted\nforefinger of day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWANN IN LOVE\n\nTo admit you to the 'little nucleus,' the 'little group,' the 'little\nclan' at the Verdurins', one condition sufficed, but that one was\nindispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose\narticles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under\nher patronage that year, and of whom she said \"Really, it oughtn't to\nbe allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!\" left both Plant�\nand Rubinstein 'sitting'; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant\ndiagnostician than Potain. Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed\nto persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses\nthan theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished\nforthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more\nreluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out\nfor themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as\nentertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical\nspirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove\nfatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to\nexpel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the\nfemale sex.\n\nApart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively\nthat season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good'\nwoman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich\nand wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own\naccord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain\nclass,' a Mme. de Cr�cy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian\nname, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who\nlooked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies\nquite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so\neasily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse\nde Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor\nwretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if\nsomebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of\neither of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy\nvirtue' would have contemptuously declined.\n\nThe Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid'\nthere. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment.\nThe young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one\nwas forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: \"We're all\nfriends here. Liberty Hall, you know!\"\n\nIf the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the\nPrelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was\ndispleasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an\nimpression. \"Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know\nquite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm\nin for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up--nothing doing!\" If he was not\ngoing to play they talked, and one of the friends--usually the painter\nwho was in favour there that year--would \"spin,\" as M. Verdurin put\nit, \"a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,\" and\nespecially Mme. Verdurin, for whom--so strong was her habit of taking\nliterally the figurative accounts of her emotions--Dr. Cottard, who was\nthen just starting in general practice, would \"really have to come one\nday and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.\"\n\nEvening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't\nwant to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the\nplague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom\nas possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the\nmusician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing\ncharades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to\nmingle any strange element with the little 'clan.'\n\nBut just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place\nin Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include\neverybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made\nthem sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the\nprofessional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a\nthird. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose\nfrom table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; \"I\ndon't know,\" Mme. Verdurin would say, \"I'm sure it will do him far more\ngood if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a\ngood night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you\nwill find him cured.\" From the beginning of December it would make her\nquite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and\nNew Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her,\non the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's.\n\n\"You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,\" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin\nbitterly, \"if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like\npeople in the _provinces_!\"\n\nHer uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: \"Now you, Doctor, you're\na sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday,\njust like any other day?\" she said to Cottard in the first year of the\nlittle 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could\nbe no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if\nhe did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone.\n\n\"I shall come on Good Friday--to say good-bye to you, for we are going\nto spend the holidays in Auvergne.\"\n\n\"In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine\nlot of good that will do you!\" And after a solemn pause: \"If you had\nonly told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there\ntogether, comfortably.\"\n\nAnd so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies\na young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening,\nthe Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a\nlover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their\ncompany and did not prefer him to their company, would say: \"Very well,\nthen, bring your friend along.\" And he would be put to the test, to see\nwhether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he\nwas susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed\nto pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one\nside, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or\nmistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in\nturn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of\nthis same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the\nacquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that\nhe would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the\nrequest at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject\nuntil she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her\nwishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with\nboundless ingenuity.\n\n\"My dear, Mme. de Cr�cy has something to say to you. She would like to\nbring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?\"\n\n\"Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of\nperfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you\nthat you are a piece of perfection.\"\n\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went\non: \"You know I'm not fishing for compliments.\"\n\n\"Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice.\"\n\nNow there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and\nthe society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would\nhave thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional\na position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But\nSwann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the\nwomen of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was\nto learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a\npatent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon\nhim, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no\nintrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in\nsome little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris,\nwhere the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken\nhis fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in\nhim a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday\nlife, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally\nprompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had\nsquandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had\nmade use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society\nladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this\nvanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair\nunknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which\nthe name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the\nfair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other\nmen of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought\na fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders'\nthat a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated.\nThree-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social\nfalsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people\nwhose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at\ninferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when\nwith a duchess, would tremble for fear of being despised, and would\ninstantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid.\n\nUnlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a\nresigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur\nto remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the\nstream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them\nabove and below that point, that degree in life in which they will\nremain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the\nend, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre\ndistractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there\nwith them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the\nwomen with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom\nhe had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as\noften as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for\nthe physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without\nreason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women\npainted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or\na melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which\nwould, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy\nhuman flesh.\n\nIf on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct\nfor him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his\neye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his\n'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to\nsubstitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in\nher company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come\nand join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the\nface of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if,\ninstead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in\nhis own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself\nin the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so\nas to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman\nmight take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers\ncarry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could\nnot be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless,\nhowever enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit\nwith a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to\ndo him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been\nsquandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly\nworded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him\nin touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in\nthe country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust\nof bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for\nit, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an\nelement of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent\nmen who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and,\nperhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their\nintelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could\nbe attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations\nmore interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written.\nSo, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the\nmore subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the\nBaron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling\nadventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the\ntrain, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was\nthe sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that\nmoment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself\nkept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity\nof circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave\nwas about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of\nsomebody's cook.\n\nIt was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals\nand academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann\ncompelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends\nwere accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on\nthem for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic\nadroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs'\nand using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest\nindiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest.\nI used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to\ntake an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in\nwholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to\nwrite to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering,\nfor it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair'\nbegan, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the\nlatter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would\nexclaim: \"Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!\" And, either\nfrom distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us\nto offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would\nmeet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers,\nas when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us\nevery Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her,\nto pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering,\nall through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often\nfailed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who\nwould so gladly have accepted.\n\nOccasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been\ncomplaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce\nwith satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my\ngrandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as\nhe could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather\nwould not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my\ngrandmother, as he hummed the air of:\n\n\n  What is this mystery?\n  I cannot understand it;\n\nor of:\n\n\n  Vision fugitive...;\n  In matters such as this\n  'Tis best to close one's eyes.\n\nA few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend \"What\nabout Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?\" the other's face\nwould lengthen: \"Never mention his name to me again!\"\n\n\"But I thought that you were such friends...\"\n\nHe had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins\nof my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly,\nand without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be\nill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him\nwhen, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had\nleft by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he\nwas leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The\ncook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations\nshe was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary\nto inform.\n\nBut when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at\nleast one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular\nthat he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for\nher sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in\nwhich she moved or into which he had drawn her. \"No good depending on\nSwann for this evening,\" people would say; \"don't you remember, it's his\nAmerican's night at the Opera?\" He would secure invitations for her to\nthe most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself\nwent regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after\na slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered\nwith a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would\nselect a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at\nthe house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking\nof the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he\nalways treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there,\nlavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would\nfind a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown\nweary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the\nflickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him\nbeautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.\n\nBut while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been\nthe realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of\na face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on\nhis part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at\nthe theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Cr�cy by an old friend of\nhis own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom\nhe might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out\nto be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be\nconferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann\nnot, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style\nof beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire,\nwhich gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those\nwomen of whom every man can name some, and each will name different\nexamples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To\ngive him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate,\nher cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes\nwere fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own\nweight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell\nor in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre\nshe had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections,\nwhich would interest her so much, she, \"an ignorant woman with a taste\nfor beautiful things,\" saying that she would know him better when\nonce she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be \"so\ncomfortable with his tea and his books\"; although she had not concealed\nher surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so\ndepressing, and was \"not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.\"\nAnd when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how\nsorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she\nwas so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he\nhad meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew,\nand appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond\nwhich had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with\ndisenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content\nhimself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting\ntoo much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in\nearly youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still\nis bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well\nbecome the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger\ndays a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves;\nlater, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough\nto make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would\nappear--since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective\npleasure--that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part\nin its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical\norder, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has\nalready been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer\nevolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws,\nbefore his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify\nit by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we\nrecall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on\nour hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the\nopening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for\nus to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where\nit sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are\nwell enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow\nour partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice.\n\nOdette de Cr�cy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent,\nand doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he\nfelt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in\nthe interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite\nof her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to\nhim, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he\nspontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared\nthinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead\nand the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface,\nwere covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period,\ndrawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray\nlocks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably\nbuilt, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of\nthe fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the\nbest-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an\narch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point,\nbeneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman,\nthat year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly\nfitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the\ninner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the\nfancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line\nwhich led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of\nvertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere\nattached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the\narchitecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her\nown, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely\nburied.\n\nBut, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her\ntelling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again;\nhe remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him\nthat it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at\nhim then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her\na touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in\nthe front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black\nvelvet. \"And won't you,\" she had ventured, \"come just once and take tea\nwith me?\" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay--which, in reality,\nhe had abandoned years ago--on Vermeer of Delft. \"I know that I am quite\nuseless,\" she had replied, \"a little wild thing like me beside a learned\ngreat man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I\nshould so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun\nit would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of\nold papers!\" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart\nwoman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself\nup, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as\ncooking the dinner, with her \"hands right in the dish itself.\" \"You will\nonly laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,\" she\nmeant Vermeer, \"I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I\nsee any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going\non behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel\nsure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say\n'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be\nable to help you with your work.\"\n\nHe had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he\ngallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. \"You are afraid\nof falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing\nelse, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!\" she\nhad said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had\nbeen genuinely touched. \"Some woman must have made you suffer. And you\nthink that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you\nare so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about\nyou when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody\nelse.\"\n\n\"And then, besides, there's yourself----\" he had continued, \"I know what\nwomen are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any\ntime to spare.\"\n\n\"I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always\nwill be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may\nsuit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted\nto come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like--to\nintroduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my\nfinding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that\nyou had gone.\"\n\nNo doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her\nthus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being\namong those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if,\nthanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that\nassistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment\nwhen a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have\nhad no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de\nCr�cy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams\nthe memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily\nimperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the\nconformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements\nof Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it\nmust henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish.\n\nIt so happened that my grandfather had known--which was more than could\nbe said of any other actual acquaintance--the family of these Verdurins.\nBut he had entirely severed his connection with what he called \"young\nVerdurin,\" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen--though\nwithout losing hold of his millions--among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One\nday he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could\nput him in touch with the Verdurins. \"On guard! on guard!\" he exclaimed\nas he read it, \"I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up\nlike this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in\nthe first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides,\nthere must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such\nmatters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after\nthe little Verdurins.\"\n\nAnd on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself\nwho had taken Swann to the house.\n\nThe Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his\nfirst appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,\nand the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course\nof the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'\n\nDr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to\nreply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or\nin earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial\nexpressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose\nexpectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a\nsimpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been\nfacetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he\nnever dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features,\nand you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which\nyou might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: \"Do you\nreally mean that?\" He was no more confident of the manner in which he\nought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally,\nthan he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by,\ncarriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which\nabsolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved,\nif it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware\nof that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of\nhis own.\n\nOn all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to\nbe permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate\nthe wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his\neducation.\n\nSo it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his\nfirst coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never\nlet pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him\nwithout an effort to secure the fullest information upon it.\n\nAs regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for\nknowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than\nwas actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended\nby those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue\nblood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion,\n'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in\nwhat particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in\nconversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other\n'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of\nstrangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat\nthem to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice\nto furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek.\n\nAs the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided\nhimself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good\nbreeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in\nany way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself\nthat is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that\nhe heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his\nfaults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued\nto regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to\nsee and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely:\n\"It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure\nyou must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're\nrather too near the stage,\" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a\nsmile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face\nuntil some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the\nspectacle, replied: \"To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and\none is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that\nI should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be\nable to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you,\nyou are so good.\" And he went on, \"Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they\ncall the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the\nboards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?\" in the hope of an\nenlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming.\n\n\"D'you know,\" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, \"I believe we are\ngoing the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the\nDoctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday\nexistence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he\naccepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n\n\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've\nnoticed the same thing myself.\" And on the following New Year's Day,\ninstead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs,\nand pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an\nartificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was\nsomething almost impossible to match.\n\nWhen Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that\nevening; \"Swann!\" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal\nby his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take\nutterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in\nreadiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, \"Swann! Who\non earth is Swann?\" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided\nas soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, \"Why, Odette's friend, whom she\ntold us about.\"\n\n\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once\nmollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of\nSwann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in\nlove with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings.\n\"Nothing amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I\nhave been tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n\nIn telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had\nalarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived,\nhowever, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,\nthough they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society.\nHe had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and\nmoved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and\nrefinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer\nsee it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills\nthe imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature,\nfreed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming\ntoo friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of\nmovement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out\nprecisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation\nby the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a\nman of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown\nyouth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before\nthe Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded,\nwithout his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social\ndeportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his\nown, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an\nassiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their\n'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only,\non meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous\nsmile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which\nCottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann supposed that the Doctor\nrecognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some\nhouse of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited,\nnever having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love.\nRegarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette,\nwhose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann\nassumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to\nthe Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would\nnot deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to\namusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's\nexpression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at\nonce invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him\nvery pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have\nbeen,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour,\n\"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she\nhad given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she\nreminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address\nas 'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little\ntwinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's\nwhat I've asked you to paint--the portrait of his smile.\" And since the\nphrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to\nmake sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and\neven made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer\nbefore she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone,\neven to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness,\nsimplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due\nto his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished\nfamily to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with\na confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it\nindicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul,\nas it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never\nwholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce\nseemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By\nasking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse\nthe usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the\ndistinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette\")\nbut he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which,\nhowever, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather\nannoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends.\nOn the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next\nrequest, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's\naunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she\nbelieved that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing\ncould be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as\nit always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with\ndeference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was\nentirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and\npronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling\nmanner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in\nthe surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had\nactually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of\ncontinuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare\nintervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive.\nSwann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in\nconversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused.\n\n\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she\nis not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most\ncharmingly when you are alone with her.\"\n\n\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was\nthat she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating\nthe epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is\nsomething of a compliment.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she\nwrites quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is\nadmirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something,\nM. Swann?\"\n\n\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle\npompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it\nsaid, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis\nand the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a\nsolemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just\nnow by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately\npedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in\nwhat he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be\nin current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole\nthing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the\nquotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended\nto introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his\nmind.\n\n\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms\nwith great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing.\n\n\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign\nof brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You\ndon't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on\nthe stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child.\n\nMme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood,\nwhich a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in\nher drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,'\nand 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture\nwhich she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the\npresents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time\nto time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there\nwhen they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine\ntheir tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of\nmortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually\nfilled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens,\nbarometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity\nof useless but indestructible objects.\n\nFrom this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the\nconversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but,\nsince the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in\nreal hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which\nsignified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that\nshe was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any\nof the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle\nwho was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'--and to the utter despair\nof M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily\namused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,'\nwas out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished\nby her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity--she would utter a\nshrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning\nto be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only\njust time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow,\nburying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and\nprevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be\nstruggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give\nway to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with\nthe gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and\nasseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird\nwhose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob\nwith fellow-feeling.\n\nMeanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light\nhis pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and\nbegged the young musician to sit down at the piano.\n\n\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be\ntormented,\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n\n\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure\nM. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he\nis going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to\ncry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like\nlast time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance;\nyou are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of\nyou will have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n\nThis little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist\nsat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though\neach of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the\nseductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the\nacute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would\nattract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at\nthe other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as\nin Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was\nbeing said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had\nbeen prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the\n'little scene' had never been so amusingly done.\n\n\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the\nandante.\"\n\n\"Just the _andante_! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it\nweren't 'just the _andante_' that breaks every bone in my body. The\n'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he\nsaid 'we need only have the _finale_,' or 'just the overture' of the\n_Meistersinger_.\"\n\nThe Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play,\nnot because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the\ndistressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised\nthe existence of certain neurasthenic states--but from his habit, common\nto many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription\nas soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more\nimportant, the success of some social gathering at which he was present,\nand of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her\ndyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor.\n\n\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the\nsame time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you\nare ill, we will cure you.\"\n\n\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a\nfavour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate.\nPerhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had\nworked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it\nwas all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely,\nfrom an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that\ninvalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend\nalways on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let\nthemselves think that they are free to do everything that they most\nenjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only\nthat they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which,\nwithout putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by\nuttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon\ntheir feet.\n\nOdette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying\nto Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n\nAnd Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get\nup. \"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette;\nyou can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n\n\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before\nhe sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.\n\n\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn\nyou that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well\nabandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these\nlittle chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a\nmoment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the\nsubject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement\nwith instruction when you look at them;--I can promise you a delightful\ntime, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges;\nhere, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear\nand the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew\na thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this\nvine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat\nless than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you,\nbut I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them\nwith my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor;\nhe will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some\npeople go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure\nhere. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little\nbronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no,\nnot with your whole hand like that; feel them properly!\"\n\n\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\"\nsaid the painter, \"we shan't get any music to-night.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are\nforbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in\nthe world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour\nof being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say\nthat you never have been jealous!\"\n\n\"But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call\nyou as a witness; did I utter a word?\"\n\nSwann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not\nlike to stop.\n\n\"Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to\nbe caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the\nyoung gentleman who will take charge of that.\"\n\nAfter the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him\nthan in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n\nThe year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music\nplayed on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the\nmaterial quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it\nhad been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the\nviolin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole,\nhe had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a\nflowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent,\nlevel, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of\nthe sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at\na given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline,\nor to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had\ntried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony--he\nknew not which--that had just been played, and had opened and expanded\nhis soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist\nair of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was\nowing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so\nconfused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only\npurely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original,\nand irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order,\nvanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression _sine materia_.\nPresumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out\nbefore our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their\npitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation\nof breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves\nhave vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to\nescape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous\nnotes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception\nwould continue to smother in its molten liquidity the _motifs_ which now\nand then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and\ndrown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they\ninstil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;--if\nour memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm\nfoundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for\nus facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to\ncontrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious\nsensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory\nhad furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true,\nand provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while\nthe playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression\nsuddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture\nto himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the\nstrength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which\nwas no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought,\nand which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had\ndistinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments\nfrom the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to\npartake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he\nhad never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could\ninitiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and\nstrange desire.\n\nWith a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere,\ntowards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly\nindicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which\nhe was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it\nchanged its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform,\nmelancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista\nof joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing,\nthat he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though\nwithout speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure\nless profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he\nwas like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment\npassing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and\nenlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether\nhe is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows\nnothing of her, not even her name.\n\nIndeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few\nmonths, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of\nrejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards\nany ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral\nsatisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally\nstating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in\nthat condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his\nmind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe\nin (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had\ngrown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations,\nwhich allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance.\nJust as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have\ndone better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he\nhad accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that\nafterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards\nupon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express\nwith any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would\nsupply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and\nexcused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely\nprecise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and\ndeath, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he\nwould let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or\nof some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words\nin a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself\nwith what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all\nof a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of\ntreatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself,\nspontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his\nmalady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond\nall hope, of starting to lead--and better late than never--a wholly\ndifferent life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that\nhe had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play\nover to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase\namong them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which\nhe had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon\nthe moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative\ninfluence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of\nthe power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out\nwhose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been\nunable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had\nindeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the\npeople who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them;\nbut most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was\nplayed; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another\nroom to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer\nimpression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a\nrecently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for\nthe evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now\non tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of\ncourse, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the\nexquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given\nhim, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced\nin outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And\nso, at last, he ceased to think of it.\n\nBut to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun\nto play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole\nbars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that\nresonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain\nof sound, to veil the mystery of its birth--and recognised, secret,\nwhispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved.\nAnd it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which\nnothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met,\nin a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once,\nin the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the\nphrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the\nwandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a\nreflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of\nhis fair unknown (and was told that it was the _andante_ movement of\nVinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could\nhave it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its\nlanguage and acquire its secret.\n\nAnd so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and\nthanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin.\n\n\"Isn't he charming?\" she asked Swann, \"doesn't he just understand it,\nhis sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano\ncould be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in\nit except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think\nI'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an\norchestra, more complete.\"\n\nThe young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining\neach of his words as though he were making an epigram: \"You are most\ngenerous to me.\"\n\nAnd while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, \"Run and fetch him a\nglass of orangeade; it's well earned!\" Swann began to tell Odette how he\nhad fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was\na little way off, called out, \"Well! It looks to me as though some one\nwas saying nice things to you, Odette!\" she replied, \"Yes, very\nnice,\" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some\ninformation about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what\nperiod in his life he had composed the sonata;--what meaning the little\nphrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know.\n\nBut none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when\nSwann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had\nexclaimed, \"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to\nconfess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to\nknow it!\"--and the painter had gone on with, \"Ah, yes, it's a very fine\nbit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,'\nsomething 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great\nimpression on us artists.\"), none of them seemed ever to have asked\nhimself these questions, for none of them was able to reply.\n\nEven to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite\nphrase, \"D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may\nas well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through\na microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we\ndon't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not\na habit of ours, that's all,\" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard\ngazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to\nfollow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another\nof her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard,\nwith a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble\norigin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend\nto admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once\nthey were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could\nunderstand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot\nrecognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the\nstereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated,\nwhile an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so\nM. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were\nincapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's\nportraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in\npainting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as\nthough he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which\nbore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were\naccustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon\nhis canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human\nform, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say\nlacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose\nspectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people--real,\nliving people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as\nthough M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or\nthat a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple.\n\nAnd yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor\nfelt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme.\nVerdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata)\nlike a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but\nchooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on:\n\"Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musician _di primo cartello_!\" he\nexclaimed, with a sudden determination.\n\nSwann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's\nsonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of\nmusicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public.\n\n\"I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,\" said Swann, thinking of\nthe old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters.\n\n\"Perhaps that's the man!\" cried Mme. Verdurin.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Swann burst out laughing. \"If you had ever seen him for a\nmoment you wouldn't put the question.\"\n\n\"Then to put the question is to solve the problem?\" the Doctor\nsuggested.\n\n\"But it may well be some relative,\" Swann went on. \"That would be bad\nenough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have\na cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear\nthere's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to\nget the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata;\nstarting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be\nghastly.\"\n\nThe painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment,\nand that Dr. Potain despaired of his life.\n\n\"What!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, \"Do people still call in Potain?\"\n\n\"Ah! Mme. Verdurin,\" Cottard simpered, \"you forget that you are speaking\nof one of my colleagues--I should say, one of my masters.\"\n\nThe painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the\nloss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected\nin certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as\nridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work\ncontains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion\nof which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so\ninsanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as\nthe insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of\nthese.\n\n\"Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as\nhe does!\" Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who\nhas the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to\nanyone who disagrees with her. \"Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!\"\n\n\"But, Madame, he is in the Academy.\" The Doctor smiled with bitter\nirony. \"If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the\nPrinces of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I\nhave Potain.'\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?\" said Mme. Verdurin. \"So there are\nfashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh,\nyou do make me laugh!\" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her\nhands. \"And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never\nseeing that you were pulling my leg.\"\n\nAs for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again\nover so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke\nfrom his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope\nto keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of\nmirth.\n\n\"D'you know; we like your friend so very much,\" said Mme. Verdurin,\nlater, when Odette was bidding her good night. \"He is so unaffected,\nquite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring\nhere, by all means bring them.\"\n\nM. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate\nthe pianist's aunt.\n\n\"I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,\" suggested Mme.\nVerdurin. \"You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first\ntime he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now\nfor years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and\nfinding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us\nto-morrow at the Ch�telet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring\nhim.\" \"No, he doesn't want that.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the\nlast moment.\"\n\nGreatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go\nto meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that\nthey went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and\nmore frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One\nevening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she\nhad not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting\nat doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them\nat first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance\nit had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann\nnever spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be\nregarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and\nin not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his\nfriends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in,\nwithout thinking: \"I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in\ntime for the _Danicheff_ revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect\nof Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elys�e.\"\n\n\"What's that? The Elys�e?\" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder.\n\n\"Yes, at M. Gr�vy's,\" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the\neffect which his announcement had produced.\n\n\"Are you often taken like that?\" the painter asked Cottard, with\nmock-seriousness.\n\nAs a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: \"Ah,\ngood, good; that's all right, then,\" after which he would shew not the\nleast trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the\nusual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point\nhis astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself\nwas actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no\nhonours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head\nof the State.\n\n\"What's that you say? M. Gr�vy? Do you know M. Gr�vy?\" he demanded of\nSwann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the\npalace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of\nthe Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the\nnewspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he\nwill be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of\nthe police infirmary.\n\n\"I know him slightly; we have some friends in common\" (Swann dared not\nadd that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). \"Anyhow, he is\nvery free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties\nare not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you\nknow; never more than eight at table,\" he went on, trying desperately\nto cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the\nPresident in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes.\n\nWhereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal\ninterpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from\nM. Gr�vy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into\nthe highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at\nall surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at\nthe Elys�e'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to\nluncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore.\n\n\"Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,\" he said, in the tone of\na customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing\nyour explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your\njourney without troubling to examine your luggage.\n\n\"I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed,\nit's very good of you to go to them!\" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded\nthe President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded,\nsince he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion,\nwhich, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them\n'fail.' \"It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.\"\n\n\"Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there.\" A\nnote of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the\nnumber--only eight at table--\"Are these luncheons what you would\ndescribe as 'intimate'?\" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle\ncuriosity as in his linguistic zeal.\n\nBut so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French\nRepublic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann\nnor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first\nimpression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without\nasking anxiously, \"D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening?\nHe is a personal friend of M. Gr�vy's. I suppose that means he's what\nyou'd call a 'gentleman'?\" He even went to the length of offering Swann\na card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition.\n\n\"This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,\" he explained, \"but\ndogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because\nsome friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there\nwas the devil to pay.\"\n\nAs for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect\nupon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of\nwhom he had never spoken.\n\nIf no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the\nVerdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but\nhe never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever\naccept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties.\n\n\"I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,\" she suggested.\n\n\"But what about Mme. Verdurin?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or\nthat my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\"\n\n\"How charming of you.\"\n\nBut Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by\nconsenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other\npleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire\nthat she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of\nsatiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty\nthat of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom\nhe happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the\nfirst part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see\nOdette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to\ncall for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little\ngirl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; R�mi, his\ncoachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him\nin her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter\nthe drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses\nwhich he had sent her that morning, said: \"I am furious with you!\" and\nsent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist\nwould play to them--for their two selves, and for no one else--that\nlittle phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of\ntheir love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin\npart, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the\nforeground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and--just as in\nthose interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a\nlong way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door--infinitely\nremote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some\nintervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral,\ninterpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with\nsimple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of\nits grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now\ndiscern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how\nhollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace\nthere was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in\nitself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an\noutburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked\nupon the sonata less in its own light--as what it might express, had,\nin fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or\nOdette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and\nwould express to all those who should hear it played in centuries\nto come--than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the\nVerdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same\ntime, of himself--which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that\npoint he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of\ngetting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of\nwhich he still knew no more than this one passage. \"Why do you want the\nrest?\" she had asked him. \"Our little bit; that's all we need.\" He went\nfarther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by\nhim, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed\nto their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had\na meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to\nthemselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters\nwritten to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with\nthe 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are\nnot fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of\na 'lass unparalleled.'\n\nIt would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside,\nwith his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as\nthe little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover\nthat it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back\nas far as the door of her little house in the Rue La P�rouse, behind the\nArc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to\ndemand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not\nso essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening,\nof arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other\nprivilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a\nprivilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had\nthe feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself\nbetween them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in\nspirit, after he had left her for the night.\n\nAnd so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage;\nand one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate\nand murmured \"Till to-morrow, then!\" she turned impulsively from him,\nplucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked\nthe pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his\ncarriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during\nthe drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it\naway, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk.\n\nHe would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone\ninside to take part in the ceremony--of such vital importance in her\nlife--of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those\nshort streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses,\nself-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and\nthere by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once\nan historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the\ndistrict was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the\ngarden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray\nof the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of\nnature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the\nflowers, the luxury which he had found inside.\n\nPassing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way\nabove the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom,\nwhich looked out to the back over another little street running parallel\nwith her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between\ndark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of\nTurkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord\nfrom the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not\nhave to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of\nWestern civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two\ndrawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow\nlobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden\ntrellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from\nend to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a\nhothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still\nuncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which\nhorticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was\nirritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been\n'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this\noccasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink\nand gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars,\nwhich kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter\nafternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which\nleft her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one\nof the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the\nvarious recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing\nout of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened\nphotographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, \"You're\nnot comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,\" and\nwith a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that\nsome little invention of her own was being brought into play, she\nhad installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of\nJapanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to\nlavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when\nher footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another,\nthe innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases)\nburned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon\nso many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of\nthis winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate,\nmore human--filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of\nsome solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a\nstandstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted\nwindows at once revealed and screened from sight--she had kept an eye\nsharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps\ndown in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put\neven one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her\ndrawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested\nupon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And\nso, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements,\nscolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots,\nwhich she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants\nshould be knocked over--and went across to them now to make sure that he\nhad not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in\nthe shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the\ncattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite\nflowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least\nlike other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk\nor satin. \"It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining\nof my cloak,\" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of\nrespect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished,\nunexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far\nremoved from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so\nrefined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to\nher drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued\ndragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a\nfleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with\nruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved\nin jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the\nmonsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency\nof the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across\nand kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these\naffectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her\nattitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had\nonce, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and\nwhose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing\nto it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired \"Lemon\nor cream?\" and, on his answering \"Cream, please,\" went on, smiling, \"A\ncloud!\" And as he pronounced it excellent, \"You see, I know just how you\nlike it.\" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to\nher, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some\njustification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures\nwhich, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must\ncease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go\nand dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in\nhis brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's\nadventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: \"What fun\nit would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could\nalways be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding,\na really good cup of tea.\" An hour or so later he received a note from\nOdette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an\naffectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its\nshapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes\nthan his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of\nsincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house.\n\"Why,\" she wrote, \"did you not forget your heart also? I should never\nhave let you have that back.\"\n\nMore important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little\nlater. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to\nmeet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he\nwas to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and\nrosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of\nthose cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when\nthey were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute\ndepression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and\none's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which\nshe had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing\na wrapper of mauve _cr�pe de Chine_, which draped her bosom, like a\nmantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him,\nbrushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one\nknee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without\ntiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended\nhead, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when\nthere was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to\nthe figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one\nof the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination\nin tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general\ncharacteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but\nrather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual\nfeatures of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust\nof the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the\nslanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman\nR�mi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a\nportrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an\noutcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen\neyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted,\nin his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of\nlife, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find\na sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his\nperception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had\nadmitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give\nthose works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness\nto life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far\nsuccumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he\nfelt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious\nand refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and\nrepeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had\nretained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine\nsatisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more\ngeneral significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the\nabstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern\noriginal, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be,\nand perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time\npast, had been receiving--though, indeed, they had come to him rather\nthrough the channel of his appreciation of music--had enriched his\nappetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity\nof pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his\ncharacter and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the\nZipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving\nhis more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the\nactual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which\nhas of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate\nof the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her\ncheeks, and the softness and sweetness--as of carnation-petals--which,\nhe supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an\nembrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken\nthreads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following\nthe curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the\ncadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her\neyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was\nmade clearly intelligible.\n\nHe stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in\nher face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to\nrecapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking\nof her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine\nmasterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been\nreproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered\nher more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his\nfailure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the\ngreat Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his\npleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own\nsystem of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of\nOdette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not,\nas he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient\nof doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in\nherself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He\nfailed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring\nOdette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply\nbecause his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The\nwords 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him\n(gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette\ninto a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been\ndebarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And\nwhereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his\nmisgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her\nbeauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept\naway and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of\nher on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss,\nthe bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately\nattractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered\nflesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his\nadoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as\nexquisite as they would be supernatural.\n\nAnd when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done\nnothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was\nnot unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an\ninestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different,\nan especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would\ncontemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind\nof an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual\nthrill of a collector.\n\nOn his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a\nphotograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would\ngaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the\nimperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair\nthat fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt\nto be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman,\nhe converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated\nhimself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might,\nultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a\nspectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh\nand blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than\ncompensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms\nhad at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time\ngazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli,\nwho seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him\nthe photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette\nagainst his heart.\n\nIt was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains\nto circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that,\nsince Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer\nto have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid\nlest the manner--at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly\nunalterable--which she now adopted when they were together should\nultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when\nshe would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become\nand would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral\naspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing\nweary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and\nfeigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her\nbefore dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she\nwould reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at\nher heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard\nher utter: and he was right--by repeating this device he had won from\nher the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one\nof them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from\nthe Maison Dor�e--it was the day of the Paris-Murcie F�te given for\nthe victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning \"My dear, my hand\ntrembles so that I can scarcely write----\"; and these letters he had\nkept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she\nhad not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would\ncome running up to him with an \"I've something to say to you!\" and he\nwould gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what\nshe had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart.\n\nEven as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the\ngreat lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were\nnever closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming\ncreature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that\ngolden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp\nand black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those\nlittle pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a\nglass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try\nto make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking,\nhis eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin\nsaid to the painter: \"H'm. Seems to be getting warm.\" Indeed, her\npresence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited\nseemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which\nramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his\nheart.\n\nAnd so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism,\nnamely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of\ndaily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to\nthe prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing\nwhich he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written\nto her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and\naccompany her home.\n\nBut one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark\ndrive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the\nBois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at\nthe Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing\nthat he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare\nof her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the\nsense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began\nthen for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that\ncertainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of\nall our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its\ndimensions.\n\n\"Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?\" M.\nVerdurin asked his wife. \"I think we may say that he's hooked.\"\n\n\"The face he pulled?\" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house\nfor a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and\ndid not know whom they were discussing.\n\n\"D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep--the loveliest of\nSwanns?\"\n\n\"No. M. Swann has been here?\"\n\n\"Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated.\nIn a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she\nhas 'burned her boats'?\" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the\nmeaning of his phrases.\n\n\"Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between\nyou and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a\nsilly little fool, which she is, incidentally.\"\n\n\"Come, come, come!\" said M. Verdurin, \"How on earth do you know that\nthere's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?\"\n\n\"She would have told me,\" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. \"I may\nsay that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I\ntold her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't;\nshe admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's\nalways shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she\ndoesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love,\n'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off--oh, I don't\nknow half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the\nsort of man she wants.\"\n\n\"I beg to differ from you,\" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. \"I am\nonly half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'\"\n\nMme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though\nshe had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which\nshe might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable\nword which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose'\nin her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who\n'mattered more' than herself.\n\n\"Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our\nfriend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to\nbelieve in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he\nlectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted\nto Odette, but really--to expound theories of aesthetic to her--the man\nmust be a prize idiot.\"\n\n\"Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,\" broke in\nMme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. \"She is charming.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying\nanything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either\nvirtue or intellect. After all,\" he turned to the painter, \"does it\nmatter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she\nmight be a great deal less charming if she were.\"\n\nOn the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been\nsomewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked\nby Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she\nwould probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Pr�vost's on her\nway home. Swann set off at once for Pr�vost's, but every few yards\nhis carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street,\nloathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath\nhis wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would\ndelay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He\ncounted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to\nbe quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so,\npossibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his\narriving at Pr�vost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then,\nin a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep\nand is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his\nmind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself\nand them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the\nthoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard\nat the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from\nwhich he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as\nthough he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because\nhe would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been\nhoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was\nobliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and\ndrove to Pr�vost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone\neven--but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him,\namalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable\nto liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such\nstratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during\nthis last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality\nwas thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more\ninteresting.\n\nIt was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at\nPr�vost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so\nbare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea,\nnot one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take\nshelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be\nmuch the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every\nother evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to\ncast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to\nwithdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of\ndesire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to\nbe able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for\npretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to\nassure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her\nagain, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which\nwould enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day\nmore the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come\nto him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet\nnever dared embrace.\n\nShe was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every\nrestaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one\ndirection, he sent in the other his coachman R�mi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan)\nfor whom he presently--after a fruitless search--found himself waiting\nat the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and\nSwann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching\nmoment, as one in which R�mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady is there,\"\nor as one in which R�mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady was not in\nany of the caf�s.\" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his\nevening--a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident\nwhich would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or\nwould oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to\naccept the necessity of returning home without having seen her.\n\nThe coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked,\nnot \"Did you find the lady?\" but \"Remind me, to-morrow, to order in\nsome more firewood. I am sure we must be running short.\" Perhaps he had\npersuaded himself that, if R�mi had at last found Odette in some caf�,\nwhere she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was\nalready obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a\nnight of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the\nattainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place,\nwhich would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of\ninertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be\nseen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid\na collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to\nperform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the\nsaying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position,\nas though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength\nand motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with,\n\"I have found the lady,\" he would have answered, \"Oh, yes, of course;\nthat's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,\" and would have\ncontinued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his\nservant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break\naway from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure.\n\nThe coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find\nher anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, \"I\nthink, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.\"\n\nBut the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when\nR�mi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a\ncast-off cloak when he saw R�mi attempt to make him abandon hope and\nretire from the quest.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" he exclaimed. \"We must find the lady. It is most\nimportant. She would be extremely put out--it's a business matter--and\nvexed with me if she didn't see me.\"\n\n\"But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,\" answered R�mi, \"since\nit was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was\ngoing to Pr�vost's, and then wasn't there.\"\n\nMeanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go\nout. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people\nstrolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness.\nNow and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few\nwords in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering.\nAnxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though\namong the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been\nsearching for a lost Eurydice.\n\nAmong all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the\nagents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious\nas the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the\nhuman spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking\namusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided,\nthat is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not\nnecessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or\neven as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her\nshould become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as--in\nthe moment when she has failed to meet us--for the pleasure which\nwe were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly\nsubstituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature\nherself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised\nsociety make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage--the\ninsensate, agonising desire to possess her.\n\nSwann made R�mi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was\nthe sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated\nso calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon\ntheir meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman,\nas though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce\nhis own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette--assuming\nthat she had long since gone home to bed,--might yet be found seated in\nsome restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the\nMaison Dor�e, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching\nsight of her, was emerging from the Caf� Anglais, striding with haggard\ngaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of\nthe Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the\nopposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had\nbeen no room at Pr�vost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the\nMaison Dor�e, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have\noverlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage.\n\nShe had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As\nfor him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed\nit possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered\neven more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his\nreason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least,\nto be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever\nbefore; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating\nprobabilities,--it remained integral and external to himself; there\nwas no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with\ntruth--'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that\nprojected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and\nscattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had\nlowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded,\nalbeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has\ncome down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and\nis doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let\nhis eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance\nstreaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet.\n\nHe climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and\nordered his own to follow.\n\nShe had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath\nthe film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers\nfastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a\nflowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a\nlarge triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,'\nalso of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were\nfastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock\nwhich the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the\nhorse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she\nuttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he assured her, \"don't be frightened.\" And he slipped\nhis arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then\nwent on: \"Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes\nor no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the\nflowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid\nof their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more\nsecurely.\"\n\nShe was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and\nsmiled as she answered: \"No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.\"\n\nBut he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the\npretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even\nbecause he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed:\n\"No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can\neasily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you\ndon't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little--I think it must be\npollen, spilt over your dress,--may I brush it off with my hand? That's\nnot too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a\nlittle; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong\nway. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would\nhave fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a\nlittle farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if\nI just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I\ndon't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.\"\n\nStill smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who\nshould say, \"You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.\"\n\nHe slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her\neyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women\nof the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type\nof hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes,\nlarge and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from\nher face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her\nneck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as\nwell as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless,\nhabitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such\nmoments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all\nher strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force\nwere drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she\nallowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips,\nheld it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his\nhands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's\nmovements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to\nassist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when\na prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps,\nmoreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not\nyet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for\nthe last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his\ndeparture, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view\nof a country to which he may never return.\n\nBut he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which\nhad begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete\nsurrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to\nappear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked\nthe audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which\ncould always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first\noccasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If\nshe had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: \"It is most\nunfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've\nnot been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that\nthis one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than\nthe others?\" Or else, if she had none: \"Oh! no cattleyas this evening;\nthen there's nothing for me to arrange.\" So that for some time there\nwas no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first\nevening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers\nfirst and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with\nthis modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or,\nrather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had\nquite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor \"Do a cattleya,\" transmuted\ninto a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its\noriginal meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical\npossession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing),\nsurvived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom\nfrom which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying\n\"to make love\" had not the precise significance of its synonyms.\nHowever disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard\nthe possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable\nand monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be\ndescribed in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure\nif the women concerned be--or be thought to be--so difficult as to\noblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our\nrelations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the\ncattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told\nhimself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his\nintention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge\nfor him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure\nwhich he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps\nonly because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that\nreason--as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid\nthe flowers of the earthly paradise--a pleasure which had never before\nexisted, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure--and the\nspecial name which he was to give to it preserved its identity--entirely\nindividual and new.\n\nThe ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must\nfollow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her\ndressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before\nthe eyes of his coachman, saying: \"What on earth does it matter what\npeople see?\" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which\nhappened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette\nelsewhere), when--more and more rarely--he went into society, she would\nbeg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The\nseason was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from\nan evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees,\ntell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on\nhis going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going\nin their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot\nwithout further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His\nfriends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was\nno longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now\ndemanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention\nto women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to\nbe met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately\nand directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier,\nhis friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed\npermanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion\nmanifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not\nonly takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates\nthe signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the\nother hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that\nwherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on\nafterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him\nwas one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an\nirresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank,\nas often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have\npreferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way,\nand to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his\nputting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to\nvisit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were\nsaying to one another: \"He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly\nbe a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,\"\nmade him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose\nexistence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual\nsacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical\ninterests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not\nconsciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she\nwas waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that\nhe would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish,\nforgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which\nhe had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before\nhis arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable\nthat it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to\nthat hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which\nOdette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so\nimmaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the\npower to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person\nseems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with\npoetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on\nwhich that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann\ncould not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him\nin the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his\nvictoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the\ndazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he\nwould think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the\nmoon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since\nthen had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it\nbathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants\nto bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden,\nhe would go round first into the other street, over which, at the\nground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of\nthe adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room.\nHe would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer,\nbefore running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the\npiano, some of her favourite music, the _Valse des Roses_, the _Pauvre\nFou_ of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her\nwill, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead,\nto give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that\nOdette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in\nour minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble\nof wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The\nlittle phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for\nOdette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were\nno corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by\nany but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such\nas to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in\nher company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood\nunchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his\nintellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the\nlittle phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate\nin him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of\nSwann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment\nwhich corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external\nobject, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely\nindividual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that\nof other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little\nphrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any\ndefinite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts\nof Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care\nfor material interests, those human considerations which affect all men\nalike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to\ninscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might\nseem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would\ncome to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence.\nWatching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have\nsaid that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe\nmore deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was\nshortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin,\nat such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from\nexperimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world\nfor which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because\nour eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes\nour intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep\nrepose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,--for him whose eyes, although\ndelicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute\nobserver of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the\nbarrenness of his life,--to feel himself transformed into a creature\nforeign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost\na fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world\nthrough his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the\nlittle phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend,\nwith what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his\ninnermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass,\nunattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of\nsound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how\nmuch secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase;\nand yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase\nrepeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong!\nHe played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it\nstealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened\nhis sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase\nagain, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she\nmust never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those\nearliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How\nclosely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until\nlovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour,\nas to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to\nstop, saying: \"How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me?\nI can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to\nplay the phrase or do you want to play with me?\" Then he would become\nannoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as\nit left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else\nshe would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy\nto figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there,\ngiving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had\nfinished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the\nwall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room\nwith him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed\nand won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would\nsweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting\nfrom his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would\nfling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks.\nAnd then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to\nkiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in\nmemory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove\nhome in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay\nher these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring\nany great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever\nof jealousy--by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak\nof the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening,\nwhen he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'--might help him to\narrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had\nbeen so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of\nthis strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the\nsame manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a\ndeserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that\nthe satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own,\nand was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was\nobedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether\nthis period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether\npresently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance,\nsave as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of\nceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding\nin things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had\nfound when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with\nthis difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette\nalone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his\nboyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later\nlife, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular\nbeing; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure\nin spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became\ngradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another.\n\nHe went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent\nher time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little,\nindeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing\nus to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire for knowledge.\nAnd so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life\nhad been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years\nearlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a\nwoman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette,\nas of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still\nattributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of\ncharacteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for\nmany years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would\nsay to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact\ncounterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a\nperson fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette,\nso good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly\nincapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so\nthat they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying\nthat she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face\nwith Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing,\nstammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how\npainful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her\nanswer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness,\nseeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents,\nfor the obvious falsehood of her words.\n\nOn certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon\nhim in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Vermeer\nto which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that\nMme. de Cr�cy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of\nher, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as\nsoon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear--changing the curve\nof her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks--an\nall-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that\nsmile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had\ngreeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the\ncarriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his\nrearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times,\nsince he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and\ncolourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon\nwhich one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions,\ntraced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But,\nonce in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann\nstill saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was\nnot so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it,\nsome friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love,\nhad not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least\nimportance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that\nvery morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed\nwith skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her\nbosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling\nhim suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not\nwholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been\nseeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he\nregistered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going\nat that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life--a\nlife almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him--of his\nmistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those\nsmiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a\nRembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom.\n\nExcept when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the\n_Valse des Roses_, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things\nthat he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to\ncorrect the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was\nnot intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her\nabout the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get\nto know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the\nVicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she\nasked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman\nthat had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she\nhad lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: \"I'm sure,\npoetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true,\nif the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not\nyou'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I\nknow something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with\na poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and\nheaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than\nthree hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished.\" If,\nthen, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one\nought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would\ncease to listen, saying: \"Yes... I never thought it would be like that.\"\nAnd he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to\nlie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he\nhad only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all\nproperly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt\nwith a brisk, \"More in it? What?... Do tell me!\", but he did not tell\nher, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different\nfrom what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was\nafraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the\nsame time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love.\n\nWith the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what\nshe had supposed. \"You're always so reserved; I can't make you out.\" She\nmarvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy\nto everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens,\noften enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or\nartist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom\nhe lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been\nconvinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any\nadmiration for his ideas--for those are entirely beyond them--but by\ntheir respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the\nrespect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social\nposition, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure\ninvitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be\nbound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of\nher to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind.\nThe fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never\nto mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was,\nshe had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another\ngirl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. \"But,\"\nSwann objected, \"surely, people don't all know your friend.\" \"Yes,\ndon't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid.\" Swann was\nunable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew\nthat such generalisations as \"People are so horrid,\" and \"A word of\nscandal spreads like a spot of oil,\" were generally accepted as true;\nthere must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable.\nCould Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the\nquestion, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental\noppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced\nby a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which\nconcealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very\ngreat longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world\nwhich she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception\nof it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a\ngenuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a\nlittle dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark\nand fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted\nto be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held\nby fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates\nfrom a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a\nconsiderable distance--with more or less strength according as one\nis nearer to or farther from their intimate centre--over the widening\ncircle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names\nform a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by\nheart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they\nhave extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation\nthat Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of\nthe world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had\nbeen guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner\nhad been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can\nestimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one\nof those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable\nworld may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do\nnot share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite\nanother kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to\nwhich they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic--common\nalike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before\nwhich Mme. Cottard bowed--of being directly accessible to all. The other\nkind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted,\naccessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of\nsome one: \"He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.\"\n\nAnd if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer,\nwith a touch of contempt, \"Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy,\nat your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What\ndo you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de\nl'Imp�ratrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays\nthe Eden-Th��tre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the\nballs...\"\n\n\"What balls?\"\n\n\"Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean.\nWait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of\nthe jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the\nbest-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears\nsuch swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a\nlight-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with\nthat old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave\na ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there.\nI should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the\ndoor, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad,\nnow, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen\nnothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball.\nYou know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the\npeople who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am\nsurprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.\"\n\nSwann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion;\nfeeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous,\ndevoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting\nit to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased\nto take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except\nwhen they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at\nrace-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would\ncontinue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to\nregard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise\nde Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet\nwith strings.\n\n\"But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a\nmarquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me\na lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like\nthat!\"\n\nNor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the\nQuai d'Orl�ans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered\nunworthy of him.\n\nIt was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to\nassume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved\nto spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for\n'bric-�-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point\nof honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old\nfamily custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give\nany account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once\nabout a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that\neverything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell\nhim what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she\nreplied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were\npanelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and\nadded, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a\nperson whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom\none had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as\nsome one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener\nwill know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: \"Her\ndining-room... is... eighteenth century!\" Incidentally, she had thought\nit hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women\nlooked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She\nmentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the\nname and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom\nshe wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he\ncould not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one\nof the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little\nhouse would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards,\nRenaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Ch�teau at Blois. It was\non this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of\nhis abode on the Quai d'Orl�ans; he having ventured the criticism that\nher friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on,\nalthough that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming,\nbut in the 'Sham-Antique.'\n\n\"You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs\nand threadbare carpets!\" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of\nthe middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the\nacquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.'\n\nPeople who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised\nsordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour\nand love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of\nhumanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided\none talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he\nloved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the\nold furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in\nthis commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that\ninterested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether,\nshe would come home saying: \"Why, he's an adorable creature; so\nsensitive! I had no idea,\" and she would conceive for him a strong and\nsudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had\nthese tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged,\nof course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she\nwould add, pouting: \"It's not the same thing, you see, with him,\"\nand, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the\npractice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary.\n\nFeeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of\nwhich she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy\nin his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad\ntaste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same\nhe loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her,\nwhich even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those\ncharacteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities\nof the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a\nhappy mood because she was going to see the _Reine Topaze_, or when her\neyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the\nflower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and\ntoast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular\nattendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's\ncertificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at\ntimes, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a\nportrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so\ndistinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her\nface that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it\nwith his lips. \"Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the\nflower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we\nwill take her there, we can but obey her wishes.\" As Swann's sight was\nbeginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles,\nwhich he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted\na single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she\nsaw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: \"I really do\nthink--for a man, that is to say--it is tremendously smart! How nice you\nlook with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!\" she\nconcluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say\nthese things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he\nwould have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she\nbelieved in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose\ntaste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a\ngrotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would\naccord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of\nworks of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose\ncompany he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a\nlittle servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some\ndecadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition\nof impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an\neducated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but\nwould not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now\nthat he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her\nsympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so\nattractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she\nliked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in\nadopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits\nand opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested\nto him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred\nthem to his own. If he went again to _Serge Panine_, if he looked out\nfor opportunities of going to watch Olivier M�tra conducting, it was for\nthe pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's\nmind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This\ncharm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and\npictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than\nthe intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed\nto him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having\nallowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his\nscepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated\nthem unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had\nfallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have\nno absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of\ndates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar\nof which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most\nrefined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached\nto receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more\nridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in\ngoing to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the\nadmiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any\nmore unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined\nas ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied\nhimself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with\nthe reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like\nnothing that was not equally felt and liked by her.\n\nLike everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was\nno more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her\nmore often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since,\nat the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings,\ngames, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre\nparties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained\n'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette,\nconversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by\ninviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the\nlittle 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine\nmerit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him\nto frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to\nwhisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion,\nthat he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to\nsuppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition\nwhich, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his\nintelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette\nevery evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as\nhis being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was\nin love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her\nwas all that he could ask. \"What a charming atmosphere!\" he said to\nhimself. \"How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far\nmore intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows.\nMme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather\nabsurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for\nworks of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about\nsome of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas\nabout artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great\nintellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking\nto Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for\nthe painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be\nparadoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come\nacross. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one\ndoes what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour\nthere is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare\nexceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more\nand more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.\"\n\nAnd as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of\nthe Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial\nreflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by\nhis love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound,\nmore vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann,\nnow and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an\nevening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to\none of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would\nnot take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme.\nVerdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous\nexclamation: \"Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?\"; since,\nwhen the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily\nwhether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still\nbe able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them\nboth to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously\nallowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and\nto influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin\nwas \"a great and noble soul.\" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the\nLouvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist,\n\"I'd a hundred times rather,\" he would reply, \"have the Verdurins.\" And,\nwith a solemnity of diction which was new in him: \"They are magnanimous\ncreatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters,\nthe one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there\nare only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have\nreached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all\nwhom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes,\nand, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to\nleave them again as long as one lives. Very well!\" he went on, with the\nslight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of\nwhat he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because\nhe enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words\nas though they came from some one else, \"The die is now cast; I have\nelected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an\natmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really\nintelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility\nof heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly\nattain--how could they?--without a corresponding loftiness of mind.\nWithout question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is\nnot, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action,\ningeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake,\nevery friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet\nquite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than\nall your textbooks of philosophy.\"\n\n* * *\n\nHe might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various\nold friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins,\ncompanions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew\nother 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had\ncast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had\nentirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and,\nif they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to\nhim.\n\nAnd so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a\nsingle one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved\nthem, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was\nnot satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments,\nhe had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too\nparticular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take\nMme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion\nwith which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining,\noften, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never\nsuspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part\nnot to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or\nother; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had\ntaken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were\nmaking of his brilliant position in society--doubtless all these things\ncontributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the\nfundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they\nhad at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable\nchamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the\nPrincesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were\nnot amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his\nfriendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they\nhad discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of\nentirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never\ncome across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the\nhouses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he\ninfinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had\nhe consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores'\nin the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as\nthey well knew, they were powerless to extort.\n\nWhat a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them\nto invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on\nwhom they were building great hopes--the Comte de Forcheville! (It\nturned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of\nSaniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement:\nthe manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always\nsupposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and\nhad never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively\naristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,'\nwhich Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never\ndream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any\nother. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from\nassociating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth\nhis notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for\nthe vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged,\nthe bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,--whereas\nSwann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these\nwithout having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them,\nForcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which\npermitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the\nleast understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted\nby the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which\nForcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences\nbetween them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated\nthe disgrace of Swann.\n\nThere was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from\nthe Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a\nwatering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his\nother works of scholarship had not left him with very little time\nto spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that\ncuriosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a\ncertain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies,\nearn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors\nwho do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in\nLatin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed\nsuperior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his\nillustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he\nspoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those\nsciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and\nimagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan'\nwhat hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps,\nbecause, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously\npreserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that\nhe was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those\nsubjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only\nbecause the folds of the gown still clung.\n\nEarly in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the\nright of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great\npains with her toilet, observed to her: \"Quite original, that white\ndress,\" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was\nhe to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a \"de,\" and was\non the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as\nto come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective\n'_blanche_' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out,\n\"_Blanche_? Blanche of Castile?\" then, without moving his head, shot\na furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the\nwhole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to\nsmile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn\nat once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of\nthe world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity\nof which had charmed Mme. Verdurin.\n\n\"What are you to say of a scientist like that?\" she asked Forcheville.\n\"You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the\nsort of thing you tell them at your hospital?\" she went on, turning to\nthe Doctor. \"They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's\nthe case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!\"\n\n\"I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of\nCastile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?\" Brichot\nappealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes\ntightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between\nwhich, now and then, escaped a muffled scream.\n\n\"Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the\nreverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, _sub rosa_...\nI recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian--oh, how\ninfinitely Athenian--Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of\nthat obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes,\nindeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!\" he repeated in his ringing voice,\nwhich sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest\nby M. Verdurin. \"The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of\nits information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that\npoint. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising\nproletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty\nfishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the\nsort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.\"\n\n\"Who is that gentleman?\" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. \"He seems to\nspeak with great authority.\"\n\n\"What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's\ncelebrated all over Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's Br�chot, is it?\" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite\ncaught the name. \"You must tell me all about him\"; he went on, fastening\na pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. \"It's always interesting to\nmeet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select\nparties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Well, you know what it is really,\" said Mme. Verdurin modestly.\n\"They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the\nconversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is\nnothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply\ndazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else\nhe's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the\nwords out of him, he's even boring.\"\n\n\"That's strange,\" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment.\n\nA sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out\nstupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life,\nfor all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the\nintelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might\neasily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed\nwitty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into\nhim their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained\nto their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social\nexistence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of\nintelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything\nin Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar,\nand disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to\ngood manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this\nstudent-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally,\nperhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme.\nVerdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville\nfellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the\nhouse. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked\nhim on her arrival: \"What do you think of my guest?\"\n\nAnd he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom\nhe had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a\ngood specimen of a man, had retorted: \"Beastly!\" He had, certainly,\nno idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as\nusual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche\nof Castile's mother, who, according to him, \"had been with Henry\nPlantagenet for years before they were married,\" tried to prompt Swann\nto beg him to continue the story, by interjecting \"Isn't that so, M.\nSwann?\" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to\nthe level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into\na trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their\nhostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in\nBlanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the\npainter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of\nthe work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had\nrecently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued\nhis discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this\nlater work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in\nhis earlier exhibitions.\n\n\"From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me\nto be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'\" said Swann with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Elevated... to the height of an Institute!\" interrupted Cottard,\nraising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out\nlaughing.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. \"It's simply\nimpossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he\ncomes with a joke.\"\n\nBut she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one\nthing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a\nlaugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead\nof replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would\nprobably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the\neasy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of\ntheir dead friend.\n\n\"I went up to one of them,\" he began, \"just to see how it was done; I\nstuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether\nit was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with\nleaven, with excrem...\"\n\n\"And one make twelve!\" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late,\nfor no one saw the point of his interruption.\n\n\"It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,\" resumed the\npainter. \"No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the\n'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either\nRembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,--and yet, no, I'll take my\noath it isn't.\"\n\nThen, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their\ncompass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be\nsatisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had\nbeen something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting:\n\"It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your\nbreath; you feel ticklish all over--and not the faintest clue to how\nit's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's\na miracle,\" bursting outright into laughter, \"it's dishonest!\" Then\nstopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass\nnote which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, \"And it's\nso loyal!\"\n\nExcept at the moment when he had called it \"bigger than the 'Night\nWatch,'\" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme.\nVerdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of\nthe universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at\nthe word \"excrement,\" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance\nround the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his\nlips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party\n(save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the\npainter.\n\n\"I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!\" cried\nMme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the\ntable-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that\nForcheville was dining with them for the first time. \"Hallo, you!\" she\nturned to her husband, \"what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping\nlike a great animal? You know, though, don't you,\" she apologised\nfor him to the painter, \"that he can talk quite well when he chooses;\nanybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you.\nIf you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking\nit all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without\nmissing a word.\"\n\n\"No, really, I'm not joking!\" protested the painter, enchanted by the\nsuccess of his speech. \"You all look as if you thought I was pulling\nyour legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and\nthen you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything\nyou like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!\"\n\n\"But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only\nwant you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche\nsome more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry;\nyou're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't\nserve the salad just yet.\"\n\nMme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking,\nfor all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right\nword in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought\ngave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not\nso much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career.\nAnd so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just\nuttered, to pass unchallenged.\n\n\"It's not a Japanese salad, is it?\" she whispered, turning towards\nOdette.\n\nAnd then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness\nand daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so\nunmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by\nDumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but\nso irresistible that it was some time before she could control it.\n\n\"Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,\" said Forcheville.\n\n\"No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to\ndinner on Friday.\"\n\n\"You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,\" said Mme. Cottard to\nSwann, \"but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous _Francillon_\nthat everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now,\nhe told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the\nevening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in\nspending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play\nalready. Of course an evening at the Th��tre-Fran�ais is never wasted,\nreally; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice\nfriends,\" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but\nrestricted herself to \"some friends of ours\" or \"one of my friends,\" as\nbeing more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all\nthe importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses)\n\"who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the\nnew pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this\n_Francillon_ sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I\ndo feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a\ncall anywhere, I find everybody talking--it's only natural--about that\nwretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a\nlittle tired of hearing about it,\" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed\nless interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. \"I must admit,\nthough, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it:\nI've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a\nbeautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells\nme that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting\nin everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play.\nThen she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among\nthe favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her\nnext 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh\ntill we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,\" Mme.\nCottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave.\n\nAnd, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by\n_Francillon_: \"Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after\nall. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Cr�cy worships,\n_Serge Panine_. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you\nthink! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the\nTh��tre-Fran�ais! Now, _Serge Panine_--! But then, it's like everything\nthat comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I\nwonder if you know the _Ma�tre des Forges_, which I like even better\nthan _Serge Panine_.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Swann with polite irony, \"but I can assure you that\nmy want of admiration is almost equally divided between those\nmasterpieces.\"\n\n\"Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about\nthem? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little\ntoo sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about\nplays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what\nmay be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.\"\n\nShe was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened\nwas that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing _Francillon_, Forcheville\nhad been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called\nthe \"little speech\" of the painter. \"Your friend has such a flow of\nlanguage, such a memory!\" he had said to her when the painter had\ncome to a standstill, \"I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a\nfirst-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and\nM. Br�chot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so\nsure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the\nProfessor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a\nbook. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are\na bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays;\nanyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as\nthat, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by\nthe way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything\nyou liked--I don't know what--this glass, say; and he'd talk away about\nit for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm\nsorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or\nanything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe.\nWhy, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.\"\n\n\"Do you see much of M. Swann?\" asked Mme. Verdurin.\n\n\"Oh dear, no!\" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself\npleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to\ntake this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable\nfriends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of\ngood-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann\nupon some undeserved good fortune: \"Isn't that so, Swann? I never see\nanything of you, do I?--But then, where on earth is one to see him? The\ncreature spends all his time shut up with the La Tr�mo�lles, with the\nLaumes and all that lot!\" The imputation would have been false at any\ntime, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had\ngiven up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere\nnames of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them\nin a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression\nwhich the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this\ntactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to\nmake on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious\nsolicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice,\nto have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been\naddressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf\nas well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong\nattempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should\nappear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without\nprotesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very\nmention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that\nher silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the\nunconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly\nemptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was\nnothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of\nthose La Tr�mo�lles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed\nto penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to\nview two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would\nhave said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was\nall no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's\ndesign for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry,\nwhere the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel\nto see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of\nthe Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Tr�mo�lles or Laumes, whose\nequals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and\nbetters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to\ninvest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity\nof his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be\nunderstood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that\nhouse, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated\nthat he called a corridor a 'collidor'!\n\n\"You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set\nfoot inside my house,\" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down\non Swann.\n\nShe could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to\necho the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed:\n\"To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody\nto go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful.\nHow can people be so common as to go running after them?\"\n\nBut he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: \"Gad, she's a\nduchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort\nof thing,\" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final\nretort, \"And a lot of good may it do them!\" Instead of which, Swann\nmerely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could\nnot, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin,\nwho was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife,\ncould see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was\nnow inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed\nin stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round\nto a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of\ncalculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:\n\n\"Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat\nit to them, you may be sure.\"\n\nTo which Swann answered: \"Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the\nDuchess (if it is of the La Tr�mo�lles that you're speaking). I can\nassure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as\nto say that she's at all 'deep'--\" he pronounced the word as if it meant\nsomething ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental\nhabits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated\nby his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard,\nso that at times he would actually state his views with considerable\nwarmth--\"but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent,\nwhile her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.\"\n\nHis explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that\nthis one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever\nattaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in\nher fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish\nhis words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her\ntortured heart, \"You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not\nsay so to us.\"\n\n\"It all depends upon what you call intelligence.\" Forcheville felt that\nit was his turn to be brilliant. \"Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean\nby intelligence.\"\n\n\"There,\" cried Odette, \"that's one of the big things I beg him to tell\nme about, and he never will.\"\n\n\"Oh, but...\" protested Swann.\n\n\"Oh, but nonsense!\" said Odette.\n\n\"A water-butt?\" asked the Doctor.\n\n\"To you,\" pursued Forcheville, \"does intelligence mean what they call\nclever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into\nsociety?\"\n\n\"Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!\" said Mme.\nVerdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped\neating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, \"It doesn't\nmatter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you\nbecause of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.\"\n\n\"There is,\" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, \"a\nrather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist\nF�nelon...\"\n\n\"Just listen to this!\" Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor.\n\"He's going to give us F�nelon's definition of intelligence. That's\ninteresting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!\"\n\nBut Brichot was keeping F�nelon's definition until Swann should\nhave given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of\nrecreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme.\nVerdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville.\n\n\"You see, it's just the same as with me!\" Odette was peevish. \"I'm not\nat all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up\nto his level.\"\n\n\"These de La Tr�mouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so\nlittle to be desired,\" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, \"are\nthey, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old\nsnob, S�vign�, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good\nfor her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her\ncase probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart,\nand always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she\nused to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Tr�mouaille,\nkept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the\nforeign politics.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,\" said Mme.\nVerdurin desperately.\n\nSaniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the\nbutler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally\nto tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined\nwith the Duc de La Tr�mo�lle, the point of which was that the Duke\ndid not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann,\nwho really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts\nillustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such\nignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped\nshort; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no\nproof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason\nthat he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely\nfrom the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious\nof having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up\nhis mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before\nthe end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the\nsight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann,\nappealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already\nsuperfluous, \"All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a\nmistake that's not a crime, I hope,\" that Swann longed to be able\nto console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and\nexquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that\nit was the right moment to interject \"_Se non � vero_,\" but he was not\nquite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out.\n\nAfter dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. \"She can't have been\nat all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really\ntalk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the\nbeam. But Mme. de Cr�cy! There's a little woman who knows what's what,\nall right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got\nthe American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Cr�cy,\" he\nexplained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. \"I should\nsay that, as a specimen of the female form--\"\n\n\"I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!\" the words came\ntumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until\nForcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary\nold joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the\nconversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with\nthat excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed\nattempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion,\ninseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the\njoke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing\nof his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by\na symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious.\nScarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man\nwho was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as\nthough, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke\nfrom his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could\nprolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he\nand Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter\nwas telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging\nher face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each\nrepresenting Comedy, but in a different way.\n\nM. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of\nhis mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment,\nmurmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated\nnow whenever he had to go to the place in question: \"I must just go and\nsee the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,\" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough\nbegan all over again.\n\n\"Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll\nchoke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,\" counselled Mme.\nVerdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs.\n\n\"What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!\"\ndeclared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. \"Thank you, thank you, an old\nsoldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink.\"\n\n\"M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,\" M. Verdurin told his wife.\n\n\"Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at\nluncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear\nabout it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that\nyou're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very\noften. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner\nout of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet\nlittle dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will\nbe quite delightful....\n\n\"Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?\" she screamed\nsuddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying,\nbefore a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing\nwit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.'\n\n\"M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,\"\nMme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he,\nstill following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had\nobsessed him all through dinner, began again with: \"I am treating a\nBaroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the\nCrusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the\nsize of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis;\nshe's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.\"\n\nWhich enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with\nMme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with:\n\"He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good\npeople. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.\"\n\n\"D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?\" asked\nthe pianist.\n\n\"What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!\" shouted M. de\nForcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had\nnever heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de\nForcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: \"No,\nno. The word isn't _serpent-�-sonates_, it's _serpent-�-sonnettes_!\" he\nexplained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant.\n\nForcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed.\n\n\"You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh! I've known it for ages.\"\n\nThen they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the\nviolin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves\nabove it--and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming\nimmobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two\nhundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley--the\nlittle phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by\nthe long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous\ncurtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as\nto a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who\nwould assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville.\n\n\"Ah! you've come too late!\" Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,'\nwhose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' \"we've been\nhaving a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence!\nBut he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time\nyou've met him,\" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her\nthat Swann owed the introduction. \"Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious,\nour Brichot?\"\n\nSwann bowed politely.\n\n\"No? You weren't interested?\" she asked dryly.\n\n\"Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little\ntoo peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see\nhim a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one\nfeels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound\nfellow.\"\n\nThe party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: \"I\nhave rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.\"\n\n\"What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?\" said\nForcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette\nwatched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann\ntake her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and,\nwhen he asked whether he might come in, replied, \"I suppose so,\" with an\nimpatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin\nsaid to her husband: \"Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an\nidiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Tr�mo�lle?\"\n\nShe had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed\nthe particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was\ndone on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had\nmade up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite\ngrasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural\ncorruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism,\nshe still said instinctively \"the de La Tr�mo�lles,\" or, rather (by\nan abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the\nwriters of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'),\n\"the d'La Tr�mo�lles,\" but she corrected herself at once to \"Madame La\nTr�mo�lle.--The _Duchess_, as Swann calls her,\" she added ironically,\nwith a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not,\nherself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile\nand absurd.\n\n\"I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.\"\n\nM. Verdurin took it up. \"He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer,\nalways hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to\nrun with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between\nhim and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you\nstraight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't.\nNot like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you\nnotice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I\ndon't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come\nthe man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any\nrate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!\"\nhe let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with\nevery page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously\nexact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort.\n\n\"I don't mind saying,\" Mme. Verdurin went on, \"that he saw fit to utter\nsome most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot.\nNaturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a\nway of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the\ndear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the\nstairs as he's going away.\"\n\n\"Didn't I say so?\" retorted her husband. \"He's simply a failure; a poor\nlittle wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's\nat all big.\"\n\nHad the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was\nnot infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take\nthe precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with\nlittle sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of\nreserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula\nas \"Of course, I don't want to say anything--\" to which he would have\nscorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery.\nThere are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least\n'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun\nby flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace\nexpressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann\ninfuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty\nof his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his\ndesigns.\n\nSwann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the\nVerdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most\nrosy light, through the admiring eyes of love.\n\nAs a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings;\nhe was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the\nday as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for\nan hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly\nlooking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way\nthat would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's\nwindow, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think\nof sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual\nsight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her,\nand would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to\nbe taken at once to the Rue La p�rouse, so as to accelerate the moment\nin which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself,\nin a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious,\nalways, that she should receive these presents before she went out\nfor the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give\nadditional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins',\nmight even--for all he knew--if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a\nletter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep,\ncome on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase,\nwhen he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt\nupon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit\nfrom her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never\nyet revealed.\n\nOften she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from\na creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he\nenjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself,\nor merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might\nmake of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, \"It's\nyour position that attracts her,\" or at this stage, \"It's your money\nthat she's really in love with,\" he would not have believed the\nsuggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought\nthat people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them,\nto be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth.\nBut even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused\nhim any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a\nfoundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities\nwhich she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an\ninterest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might\nbe tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while\nhe lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services,\nhe could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his\nintellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself\nattractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone,\nof the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which,\nin the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial\nsensations, enhanced its value in his eyes--as one sees people who are\ndoubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are\nreally enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare\nquality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have\nagreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which\nthat sight and that sound may be enjoyed.\n\nOne day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to\nthe memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of\na 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with\ncontrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman--an\niridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered,\nas in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers,\ninterwoven with precious jewels--with that Odette upon whose face he\nhad watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer,\nresentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness,\nwhich he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on\nthe faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently\nturned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his\ncollections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his\ntitle-deeds and bonds;--the thought of the banker reminded him that he\nmust call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the\ncurrent month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in\nher financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given\nher five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond\nnecklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for\nhis generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy,\nand would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love\nfor her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself\ndiminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not\nprecisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that\nidea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious\nnor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life,\nsuch as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn\nin places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying\nthe household accounts and the rent, had locked up in a drawer in\nthe old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four\nothers, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette,\nsince he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she\ncould ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title,\nwhich he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He\ncould not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental\nlethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential,\nhappened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his\nbrain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting\nhad been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering\na switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind\nfumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles,\nwiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light\nuntil he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the\nrealisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette\nsix or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise\nfor her and to give her pleasure.\n\nIn the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet\nOdette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants\nwhich they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud,\nhe would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one\ntime, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with\npeople who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette,\nand thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for\nher some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to\nthe refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his\ncontempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the\nresult that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest\nlodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely\nmansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he\ncould not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He\nhad the same regard--to a degree of identity which they would never have\nsuspected--for the little families with small incomes who asked him to\ndances in their flats (\"straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the\ndoor on the left\") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most\nsplendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually\n'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families\nin the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of\nwash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into\ncloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their\ncounterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays,\npeople who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive\nfrom a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were\ndining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he\nchanged his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette,\nand in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette\ngave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar\ncharm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his\ncarriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in\nafter him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which\nhe might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table,\nunobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm\nhimself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would\ngive way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat\nand nostrils--a new experience, this,--as he fastened the bunch of\ncolumbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither\nwell nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the\nVerdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in\nthe country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even\nfor a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the\nfinest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a\ncity of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what\nwas incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray,\nwhere, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed,\nthanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from M�s�glise,\nhe could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an\narbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed\nwith forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner,\ntrained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about\nhis table currant-bush and rose.\n\nAfter dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at\nSaint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so\nabruptly--especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the\n'faithful' before their normal time--that on one occasion the Princesse\ndes Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left\nbefore the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the\nBois) observed:\n\n\"Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might\nbe some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us\nall as a joke.\"\n\nHe persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go\ndown to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes\nor at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would\nreturn home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young\nleaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the\nlittle phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant\npiano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken\nimmense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room\nor from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to\nfavour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of\nentertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would\nstimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary\nsense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself\nthat another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force\nhimself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement\ninto which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a\nfeverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him,\nrobbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable\nbackground to the impressions that we derive from nature.\n\nOne evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and\nhad mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual\nbanquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed\nacross the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was\nnow one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:\n\n\"Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then,\ntill I get home; don't be too late.\"\n\nAnd although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously,\nat Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the\n'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow,\nbefore them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each\nother regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and\nher own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had\noften reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in\nthe supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to\nhimself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard\nit proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that,\nto several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and\ndesirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused\na painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest\nparticles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value\nto those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her\nupon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that,\nand counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly\npossessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her\naside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to\nher by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of\nthe pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme\npleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should\nlast and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy.\n\nWhen he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring\nrain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take\nhim home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having\ninvited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting\nno one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather\nthan set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps,\nif she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every\nevening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and\nfail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly\ndesired it.\n\nIt was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology\nfor having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was\nindeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and\nshe warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour,\nthat at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt\ntired and wished to sleep.\n\n\"No cattleya, then, to-night?\" he asked, \"and I've been looking forward\nso to a nice little cattleya.\"\n\nBut she was irresponsive; saying nervously: \"No, dear, no cattleya\ntonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?\"\n\n\"It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.\"\n\nShe begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains\nclose round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house\nagain, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting\nsome one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired,\nthat she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should\nsuppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left\nthe house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the\nstranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch.\nIt was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took\na cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at\nright angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house,\nand along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom\nwindow, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all\ndeserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite\nher house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the\nlights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one,\nfrom which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a\nwine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the\nroom within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it,\nfar off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its\nmessage: \"She is there--expecting you,\" and now tortured him with: \"She\nis there with the man she was expecting.\" He must know who; he tiptoed\nalong by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting\nbars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the\nsilence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered\nas he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind\nthe closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that\nmurmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his\nown departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at\nthat moment tasting with the stranger.\n\nAnd yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced\nhim to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its\nuncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that\nfirst moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost\nwithin his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light,\ncaught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which,\nwhen he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or\nrather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had\ncome there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn\nthat he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while\nhe himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him,\nas sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been\ntricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in\ntheir error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they\nbelieved to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a\nplan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to\ntap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable\nfeeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution\nof a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure.\nIf, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the\ndelicate attraction that they had had for him long ago--though only when\na light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette--now it was\nanother of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth,\nthat Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for\na truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress,\nreceiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the\nsole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost\nimpersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette--Odette in her activities,\nher environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in\nhis life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had\nalways seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things\nwere repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he\nlistened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his\nmind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and\nuninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another\nperson becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which\nhe could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a\nwoman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which\nhe had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which,\nuntil now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night,\noutside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly\nprovocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening\nat doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the\ndeciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation\nof old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of\nscientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value\nand being legitimately employable in the search for truth.\n\nAs his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at\nthe thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that\nhe had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She\nhad often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who\nspied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would\ndetest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as\nhe refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she\nloved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness\nthus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate\ngratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed\nto him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story\nof certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to\nreconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window,\nstreaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of\none of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures\nthe scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for\nthe satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that\nbrief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm,\nso beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt--which he so\ndesperately wanted to feel--that he had over them, lay perhaps not so\nmuch in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew\nhimself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again;\nlouder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice--he strained his ears\nto distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the\nvoice could be--asked:\n\n\"Who's that?\"\n\nHe could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window\nfirst, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to\nretire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible,\ntoo jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty,\nwelcoming tone:\n\n\"Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light.\nI wanted to know if you were feeling better.\"\n\nHe looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one\nof them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into\nthe room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the\nhabit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by\nthe fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows\notherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and\nhad knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made\nwhat apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction\nof his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having\nfeigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference,\nhe had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof\nof the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and\nfinally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other\nenough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to\nthink of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering\ncourse would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would\nstartle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness,\nand leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had\nbeen a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the\ncase of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the\nmind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has\nmomentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by\nrecalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but\nto think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation\nwith his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually\nuttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a\nclumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette,\nhe was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle\nmockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was\nall tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which\nshe seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as\nthough against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first\nevening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay\nnestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her\nshoulders, as though shrinking from the cold.\n\nBut then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love,\npresented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile\nwith which she had greeted him that very evening,--with which, now,\nperversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to\nanother--of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other\nlips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection\nthat she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he\nbore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches,\nrough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to\none in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes,\naflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for\nothers. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he\ntasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been\nso imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh\ncharm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they\nwould go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret\ntorture-chamber.\n\nA fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden\nexpression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the\nfirst time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'.\nWhether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his\nbrother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt\nof him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed\nby some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had\npassed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever\ntactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for\nsome time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from\nthe house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and\nwhom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling\nembarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville\nreplied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse,\ngoing out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted,\nby the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor\ncreature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and\nreceiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with\ntears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but\nwhen the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal\nexpression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to\nbring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes\nhad sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity,\nof ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she\nhad darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly\nimplied: \"That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you\nsee what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,\" that Forcheville,\nwhen his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended\nanger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: \"He need\nonly have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good\nscolding does a man no harm, at any time.\"\n\nOne day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call,\nand had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it\noccurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he\nnever went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at\nhome, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing\nher for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he\nbelieved Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a\nsound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and\nannoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her\nhouse, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and\nhe could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still\nno one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He\nturned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in\nbelieving that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with\nthe suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting\nfor an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she\nhad been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had\nawakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out\nto meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him\nknocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of\nthose fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise,\nconsole themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood\nwhich they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated,\nand will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true\nthat, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to\ndisclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her\nheart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to\nwhom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted\nlike wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties\nwere paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void;\nstill, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely\nthe fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was\nthe one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment,\nof no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was\nthe best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less\ndangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. \"At any rate, this is true,\"\nshe said to herself; \"that's always something to the good; he may make\ninquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that\nwill give me away.\" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she\nhad not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth\nhad sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those\ncontiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily\ndetached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she\nmight embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and\nby the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was\nelsewhere.\n\n\"She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was\nmyself, that she wanted to see me,\" Swann thought to himself. \"But that\ndoesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.\"\n\nHe did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he\nthought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some\nfalsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she\nspoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and\nsorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly\nfeeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that,\nlike the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a\nfaint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable\ntruth;--what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when\nhe had called,--a truth of which he would never possess any more than\nthese falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would\nexist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who\nwould contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never\nyield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong\nsuspicion that Odette's daily activities were not in themselves\npassionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with\nother men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every\nrational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with\nfever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that\ninterest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and\nthat, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses\nthat she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as\nthose of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful\ncuriosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in\nhimself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to\nregard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step\nto satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of\nwhich--supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as\nwell as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life,\nthe group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's\nintelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's\ndisbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be\ndiscovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members--is no\nlonger that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the\nphilosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external\nobjects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years\nalready spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they\ncan regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will\ndeliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence\nwhich they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed\nit wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived\nfrom not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the\nimpetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate\nin his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with\nregard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of\nwhich would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the\ngratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be\nexpected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for\ncollecting things, or for good cooking.\n\nWhen he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged\nhim to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him\nby the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to\nthat, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little\nincidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we\nshould pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by\nthose that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching,\nwhereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed.\nShe kept on saying: \"What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come\nin the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.\" He knew\nvery well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so\nkeenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a\ngood-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when\nshe had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that\nshe should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that\npleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a\npleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a\nmatter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began\nat length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was\nusual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of\nthe Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken\nexpression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief\ntoo heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to\nplay with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He\nhad seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could\nno longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had\nlied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner\nfrom which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so\nthat she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most\nscrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent\na lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and\nserved to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most\nterrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when\nshe lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for\nher defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer\nexhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She\nknew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the\nman to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at\nhis mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and\nculpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant,\nsocial lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it\nrecalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent\nwith a consciousness of wrongdoing.\n\nWhat depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give\nher that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter\nbeneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead\nfor pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what\nhad occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him,\nbut something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet\nhappened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would\nthrow a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the\nfront-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words\ndwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann\nthat afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a\nuniversal despair.\n\nHe could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as\nthough some one were going away--probably the person whom Swann must on\nno account meet--after being told that Odette was not at home. And then,\nwhen he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in\nthe habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of\nwhich she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement\nthat amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with\nOdette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards\nher, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt\nfor her only, and murmured: \"Poor darling!\" When finally he left her,\nshe took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him\nif he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the\npost-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each\nof them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen,\nexcept the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. \"If\nI saw what was in this,\" he argued, \"I should know what she calls him,\nwhat she says to him, whether there really is anything between them.\nPerhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards\nOdette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which\nis, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her\nsuffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter\nis posted.\"\n\nHe left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter\nin his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the\nenvelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish\nnothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the\nstiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper,\nto read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If,\ninstead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to\nForcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed\nto Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender\nkind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the\nenvelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger\nand thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the\nenvelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was\npossible to read.\n\nIn spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not\nthat it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the\nletter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had\nnothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's\nuncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line \"I\nwas right,\" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing,\nuntil suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher,\ncame to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: \"I was right to\nopen the door; it was my uncle.\" To open the door! Then Forcheville had\nbeen there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence\nthe sound that Swann had heard.\n\nAfter that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for\nhaving treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him\nthat he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she\nhad written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had\nadded: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let\nyou have that back.\" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion\nthat could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was\nobliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse\ntreated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him\nbelieve that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that\nhe, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose\nsake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing\nbetween Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once,\nwhy have said, \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" Right?\nif she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville\npossibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann\nstood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at\nthis envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so\nabsolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window\nthere had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident\nwhich he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the\nlife of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into\nits surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the\ndiscovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence,\nfiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its\nvitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in\nstore, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over\nthe visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could\nseek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's\naffection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on\nit, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she\npassed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him\nfrom supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at\nfirst, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which\nan incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose\nthat Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus\nwhich throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle,\nfastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in\nthe afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was\nincapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the\nperpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without.\n\nFrom without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He\ndecided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a\nfew days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every\nmale person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so\nhe, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new\npeople and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human\nsociety as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have\nturned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for\nOdette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate\ndesire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's\ncharacter, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the\noutward signs by which that character had been intelligible.\n\nA month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's\nletter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were\ngiving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of\nwhispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests,\nand thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to\na party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party.\n\nThe Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the\npainter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: \"There must be no lights\nof any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us\nto see by.\"\n\nMme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that\nexpression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and\nto preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the\nlistener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching\nsigns of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence,\nan expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder,\nthe enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who\nhave made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have\nbeen made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had\ndecided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of\nlife, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated\nhim from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he\ndrove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her\npromise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she\nwould procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her\narms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were\nordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:\n\n\"Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,\" trying, by the\nfriendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent\nhim from noticing that she was not saying, as she would always have\nuntil then:\n\n\"To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.\" M. and Mme.\nVerdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up\nbehind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into\nhis own.\n\n\"Odette, we'll take you,\" said Mme. Verdurin, \"we've kept a little\ncorner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mme. Verdurin,\" said Odette meekly.\n\n\"What! I thought I was to take you home,\" cried Swann, flinging\ndiscretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was\nprecious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her.\n\n\"But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...\"\n\n\"That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like\nthis dozens of times,\" said Mme. Verdurin.\n\n\"But I had something important to tell Mme. de Cr�cy.\"\n\n\"Very well, you can write it to her instead.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Odette, holding out her hand.\n\nHe tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly\ndejected.\n\n\"What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with\nus?\" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. \"I was\nafraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette\nback. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say,\nstraight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how\nOdette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the\ntime, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about\nit all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me.\" A moment\nlater she added, inarticulate with rage: \"No, but, don't you see, the\nfilthy creature...\" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of\nthe same obscure need to justify herself--like Fran�oise at Combray when\nthe chicken refused to die--the very words which the last convulsions of\nan inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is\nengaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved\non, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his\nface, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news.\n\nSwann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through\nthe Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in\nthe same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt\nwhen describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the\nmagnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles,\nthe kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found\nthem charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the\nVerdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed\nto him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with\na sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom\nOdette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid\nbare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame.\n\nHe drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the\nparty next evening at Chatou. \"Imagine going to Chatou, of all places!\nLike a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are\nsublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have\ncome out of one of Labiche's plays!\"\n\nThe Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. \"Could anything be more\ngrotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one\nanother like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul\nthey would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at _Chatou_!\"\nAlas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed\nmatch-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his\nstudio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country,\n\"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a\nfool!\"\n\nHe could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner,\njokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed,\nhad always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them,\nlaughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that\nit was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. \"What a fetid\nform of humour!\" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of\ndisgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen\nagainst his collar. \"How, in God's name, can a creature made in His\nimage find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The\nleast sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale\nexhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is\nincapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at\nthe expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand\nto her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be\nimpossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell\nso many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin\nsprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot\npossibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!\" he cried,\ntossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. \"God knows\nthat I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to\nteach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has\nits limits, and mine is at an end,\" he concluded, as though this sacred\nmission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from\nlonger than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only\nsince it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be\ndirected at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from\nhim.\n\nHe could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and\nthe grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking\nof her nerves by Beethoven's music. \"Idiot, liar!\" he shouted, \"and a\ncreature like that imagines that she's fond of _Art_!\" She would say to\nOdette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville,\nas she had so often done for himself: \"You can make room for M. de\nForcheville there, can't you, Odette?\"... '\"In the dark!' Codfish!\nPander!\"... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which\nwould invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each\nother's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was\nmuch to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards\nthe arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of\neducation in France.\n\nIn a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so\noften described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form\nof life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society.\n\"It really is,\" he repeated, \"beneath the lowest rung of the social\nladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words\nof the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it,\nsurely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now\nand then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that\ngang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know\nthem, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound\nintuition there is in that '_Noli me tangere_' motto of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain.\"\n\nHe had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had\nalmost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off\nthe intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more\nand more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority\nof his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the\nnight: \"People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better\nthan I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least,\nare impossible. So-and-so\" (a fashionable woman whom he had known)\n\"was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a\nfundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever\nhappened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and\nan old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something\ncomplete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type;\nthey're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God,\nit was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse\nwith such infamy, such dung.\"\n\nBut, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so\nearlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the\nVerdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured\nand protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication\nin which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which,\neven when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could\nhave come to him from Odette alone;--so the immorality (had it really\nexisted) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless,\nif they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to\nunstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.'\nDoubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it\nrefused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their\ncircle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an\nartificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen\nrather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in\nfact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he\ndid not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he\nhad reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him\nthan he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the\ndoor again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which,\nthis time, was quite natural; \"I believe I have found a way of getting\ninvited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!\" But it must have been a\nbad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been\nsummoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the\nVerdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at\nChatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table\nat their house:\n\n\"Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you\nmight call a personal friend...\" \"I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!\"\ncried Mme. Verdurin. \"Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for\nwords, a stupid, ill-bred boor.\"\n\nOn hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended\nwith entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth\nwhich contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was\nsupported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous\nemotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied:\n\"Oh--oh--oh--oh--oh!\" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his\nforces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the\nwhole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann\nat the Verdurins'.\n\nAnd so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together\nbecame an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to\nhim, as she had said in the early days of their love: \"We shall meet,\nanyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',\"\nbut \"We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a\nsupper-party at the Verdurins'.\" Or else the Verdurins were taking her\nto the Op�ra-Comique, to see _Une Nuit de Cl�op�tre_, and Swann could\nread in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which,\nbut a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting\nwith a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now\nexasperated him. \"Yet I'm not really angry,\" he assured himself, \"when I\nsee how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that\ndunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her;\ndisappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in\ndaily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her\nmind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for\nVictor Mass�! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the\nstage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with\nthe least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego\nan amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to\nsay: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what\nshe answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and\nfor all.\" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all,\nin order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's\nspiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening\ninstead of going to the Op�ra-Comique, he adopted the same line of\nreasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had\nused with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was\nyielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.\n\n\"I swear to you,\" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the\ntheatre, \"that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a\nselfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have\na thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have\nbeen tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if,\nafter all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my\npleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come\nwhen, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to\nreproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which\nI felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern\njudgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your _Nuit de\nCl�op�tre_ (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know\nis whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of\nmentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are\nincapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone\nlove you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at\nleast perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle\ndown any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable\nof thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to\ndash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always\nmistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the\neffect--I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you,\nthat goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my\neyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath\neverything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself\none inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as\nthough it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your\n_Nuit de Cl�op�tre_ (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject\na name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since\nI had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue\ndepend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due\nwarning.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty.\nAlthough the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it\nwas to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes\nwhich her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying\nany heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not\nmake unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in\nlove, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in\nlove later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost\ntranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if\nhe went on speaking for any length of time she would \"never\" as she told\nhim with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, \"get there in\ntime for the Overture.\"\n\nOn other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which,\nmore than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her\nrefusal to abandon the habit of lying. \"Even from the point of view of\ncoquetry, pure and simple,\" he had told her, \"can't you see how much\nof your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank\nadmission--how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less\nintelligent than I supposed!\" In vain, however, did Swann expound to\nher thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have\nsucceeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette\nhad no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished\nSwann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not\ntelling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only\nas a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide\nwhether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which,\ntoo, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's\ndiscovering that she had not told him the truth.\n\nPhysically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was\ngrowing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised,\nwistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished\nwith her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to\nSwann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking.\nHe would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm\nwhich he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the\nknowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still\nOdette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and\nevasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever,\nto captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two\nyears before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that\nwould console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily\nendured on her account.\n\nWhen the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to\nMeulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose\nto remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme.\nVerdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist,\nwhose aunt had remained in Paris: \"She will be only too glad to be rid\nof you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows\nyou're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the\nblame on me.\"\n\nIf this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until\nhe came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after\nfirst finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must\nwarn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message\nfor anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could\nnot possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without\ncompromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days\non end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to\nCompi�gne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the\nforest--after which they went on to the Ch�teau of Pierrefonds.\n\n\"To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who\nhave spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly\nbombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or\nSaint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of\nthat she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded\nof creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of\nLouis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge\nof art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any\nparticularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose\nto spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their\nfragrant exhalations.\"\n\nBut when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds--alas, without\nallowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for,\nas she said, that would \"create a dreadful impression,\"--he would plunge\ninto the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway\ntimetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the\nafternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than\nthat, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the\ntime-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the\npublic were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that\nat eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which\narrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds\nwas a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous;\nan act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether\ndifferent from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never\neven heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified\nthe labour and expense of stoking the engines.\n\nSo it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to\nPierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found\nthat he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he,\nlike the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long\ntime past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of\nViollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was,\nhe felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of\nCompi�gne.\n\nIt was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access\nto the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down\nthere, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that\nvery day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one\nwho did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure:\n\"What, you here?\" and would have invited him to come and see her at the\nhotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand,\nit was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed,\nwould complain that she was being followed, would love him less in\nconsequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him.\n\"So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!\" she\nwould reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who\nwas not allowed to go.\n\nHe had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compi�gne and\nPierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet\nOdette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis\nde Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This\nfriend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its\nulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his\nastonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come\ndown and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish\nto stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for\nwalks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there\nalready with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did\nnot succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on\nthat soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she\nwas to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility\nof her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Ch�teau, now\nbeautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to\nvisit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic;\ndown every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of\nsunset;--innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly\nsimultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his\nhappy, vagabond and divided heart. \"We mustn't, on any account,\" he\nwould warn M. de Forestelle, \"run across Odette and the Verdurins. I\nhave just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One\nhas plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while\ncoming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them.\" And\nhis host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place,\nSwann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the\ndining-rooms of all the hotels in Compi�gne without being able to make\nup his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no\ntrace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had\nclaimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment\nhe found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have\nhastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had\nseen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was\nnot, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at\nonce that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de\nForestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused\nhimself: \"No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see,\nOdette is there.\" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling\nthat if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds\nthat day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who\ndiffered from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction\nwhich for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely\nwhere one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that\nlove which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a\nquarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his\ndays in poring over a map of the forest of Compi�gne, as though it\nhad been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with\nphotographs of the Ch�teau of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which\nit was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table\nagain, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have\npostponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He\ndid not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go\nto bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise\nhim with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed\nsome delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he\nleaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for\nin spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to\ndeliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was\nnot at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant\nrumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any\nattention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming\nnearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the\ndistance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no\npurpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had\nbeen in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not\nknowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a\ntheatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.\n\nAs a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments\nas these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value\nto Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For\nin this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had\nonce before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on\nthe night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had\nhunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards,\nat Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings\nthat would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them\nwithout Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty\na woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a\ncase filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he\nwould scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many\npickpockets. But their faces--a collective and formless mass--escaped\nthe grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his\njealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand\nover his eyes, he cried out: \"Heaven help me!\" as people, after lashing\nthemselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the\nproblem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality\nof the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning\nact of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly,\nindissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily\nlife--when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or\nto bed--by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions\nwithout her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the\nchurch of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of\nAustria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of\nstaying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off,\nto which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of\nits cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons,\nat once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this\nrestaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the\nstreet in which Odette lived: the Lap�rouse. Sometimes, when she had\nbeen away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before\nshe thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And\nthen she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have\ntaken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little\nfragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very\nmoment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood;\nat least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it\nwould have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival\nat the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of\nwhat she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in\nher mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at\nthe moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In\nSwann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled\nand hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so\nindubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had\ncome by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been\nconvinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or\nhour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette.\nThese words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing\nthem, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe\nthat she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was\nalso, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say\nappeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that\nof one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would\nspend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a\nfirm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of\nthe unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved\nto have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of\nOdette, and had been dead for twenty years.\n\nAlthough she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public\ngatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally\nthat, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited--at\nForcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of\nthe Ministries--he found himself in the same room with her. He could\nsee her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be\nspying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures\nwhich--while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed,\nas anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the\nevenings when he came to dine with us at Combray--seemed illimitable to\nhim since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice,\nhe derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be\ninclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety\nabruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying\nof the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's\nstudio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him\nOdette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom\nher glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at\nsome voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at\nthe Bal des Incoh�rents, to which he trembled to think that she might be\ngoing on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of\ntheir actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he\nwas opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these\nwords (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which\nhad so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect,\nmade Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible,\nbut tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like\na part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped\nOdette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance,\nshewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment,\nfor his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of\nwhich she had already wearied)--in these words, which Odette flung out\nafter him as he was crossing the threshold: \"Can't you wait a minute for\nme? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me.\" It\nwas true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at\nthe same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be\nallowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann:\n\"Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you\nmay come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay\nlong, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and\nhe's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you\nonly knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no\none that really knows you, is there, except me?\"\n\nAnd Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her\naddressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender\nwords of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: \"I\nfeel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with\nthem on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at\nleast be polite,\" or \"Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so\nthat you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm\ngoing to make you work, I can tell you,\" which proved that Odette kept\nherself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that\nthey had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a\nsmile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.\n\nAnd then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as\nwhen the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting\nall round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows\nwhich, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object\nitself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of\nOdette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there\nbefore his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in\nOdette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an\nartificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of\nconcealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly\nin his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory\nimpression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was\nnot there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits,\nbut was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself\nhad not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for\nForcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but\nprecisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that\nthe world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and\nsupernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her--and which\nexisted, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe,\nexhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which\nhe might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was\nbeing permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated\nwith as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing\nhis dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves\nwere, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable\nrealisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took\nshape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed\nhis troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single\ndwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if,\nwhen asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been\nOdette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when\nOdette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du\nBois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he\nhad no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she\nwas too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at\nhome, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to\ndo what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details\nof Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they\nwould, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have\ntaken on--like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had\nabsorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his\nlonging,--a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.\n\nAnd yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much\nlonged was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere\nfavourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature\nalways absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her\nwas no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by\nthe phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when\nthose normal relations were established between them which would put an\nend to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's\ndaily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic\ninterest--as he had several times, already, felt that they might be,\non the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her\nletter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific\ndetachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study\nits effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette\nmight or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid\nstate, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a\nrecovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then\nwas.\n\nAfter these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily\nlulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning,\nwould order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her\nkindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the\ndesire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had\nneed of some such outlet.\n\nBut at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine\nthat Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat\nwatching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on\nthe evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited,\nwhile he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face\nwhich even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then\nturned away, solitary, crushed,--she must have employed, to draw\nForcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: \"Do look at him,\nstorming!\" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as\non the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'.\n\nAt such times Swann detested her. \"But I've been a fool, too,\" he would\nargue. \"I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the\nsame, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for\nI might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd\nbetter knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think\nthat, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth\nfor the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly\nlittle places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However\nshe didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's\nhope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a\nfortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as\na fish does in little apples; it will be fun!\" And his hatred, like\nhis love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with\nurging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the\nperfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and\nwould be able, if it turned out--as he tried to convince himself--that\nshe was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her,\nemptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he\nwent so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from\nher, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth,\nbut with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had\npromised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he\nwould have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have\nthat audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that\nvindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and\ndeclaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter.\n\nThe very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and\ntheir friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances\nof Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money,\nshe would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have\nthe pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not\na word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth\nwould be a bar to his.\n\nThen that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully\nrehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be\nused, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he\nfelt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily\nprocure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth,\nsince she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing\nbetween Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to\nlive in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have\nbeen if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of\norganising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little\nsuppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which,\nit was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of\nForcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be\nSwann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent\nit, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the\ncarriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter\nhow great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be\nkept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled\nwith a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had\nbecome for Swann in the last forty-eight hours.\n\nBut she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining,\ncrafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of\nan execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: \"Look at him storming!\" began\nto grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before\nhim, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who\nalso turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there\nwas nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: \"You mustn't stay\nlong, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's\nhere. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!\" that same smile\nwith which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy\nwhich she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him\nin one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him\nalone.\n\nThen, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced\nhim to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then,\nshe had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him\nfrom the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his\nloyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear\nto her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in\nForcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that\nOdette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less\nthan nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of\nreciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love,\nbut the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as\nthe spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the\ndistraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation\nof a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities.\n\nNow that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally\nreturned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment\ndriven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her\nto himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes,\nand so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards\nher, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and\nhe preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly\nglance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it\nhad not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to\nsatisfy his desire.\n\nWhat distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate\nreasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to\nmake him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her.\nHad he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women,\nto whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling\nno anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever\ncame when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with\nregard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy\nalone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in\nthis desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike\ningenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be\nable, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for\ntheir hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own.\n\nHe returned to the other point of view--opposite to that of his love\nand of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental\nequity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities--from\nwhich he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the\nsupposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him\njust a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he\nhimself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from\nhim, and warped against him.\n\nWherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or\nwith other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with\nhim, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements?\nAt Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought\nof him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great\ndeal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make\nway, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a\ntriumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had\nengineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going\nthere, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was\nquite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by\nhis counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by\nhim, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those\npeople who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would\nhave had to acknowledge her indebtedness.\n\nAnd if--instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him,\nwithout having seen him again--he were to send her this money, if he\nwere to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to\nmake it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him,\nhappy, grateful, and he would have the joy--the sight of her face--which\nhe had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could\nreplace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her\nwithout revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in\nher smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was\nno longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again\nbecame, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's\nperson gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one\nmight a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the\nbirth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the\nutterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different\nfrom every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which\nshe alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as\ndisinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which\ncharacterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness,\nthe depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of\nspiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this\nunlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate\nhealth who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and\nseems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:--this\nother need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible,\nmaterial world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.\n\nAnd so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created\njealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity\nfor Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind.\nHe was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to\ncome to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured\nfor her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her\nface and moulding her smile.\n\nSo, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days,\nas tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a\nreconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him,\nor even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her,\nthe favours by which he set most store.\n\nPerhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during\ntheir quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any\nmoney, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not\nrealise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate\nwith himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future\nrelations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that\na rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time\nbefore going to see her again.\n\nSometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no\nfresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her,\nhe knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more\nprobably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in\nwhich he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and\nwould not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested.\nMeanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of\nthose very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief,\nagain took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of\nagitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which\nhe had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run\nto find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following\ndays. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged\nhis letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing\nher. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had\nentirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something\nprecious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to\npossess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving,\nas he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there.\nBut the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not\nsimply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a\nnew state which it was impossible to foresee from the old.\n\nBut at other times--when Odette was on the point of going away for a\nholiday--it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the\npretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until\nher return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of\na serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a\nseparation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was\ngoing away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little\nsooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious,\ndistressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this\npicture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break\nhimself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the\nfurthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust\nit away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks'\nseparation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would\nconsider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it\nwas also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether\nhe would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an\nabstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time\nthan he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without\nhaving, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And\nyet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or\nof weakness in his body,--by inciting him to regard the present as an\nexceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which\nprudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing\neffects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come\nwhen its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday--suspended the\naction of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or,\nwithout that even, the thought of some information for which he had\nforgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she\nwould have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment,\nwhether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him\nto buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without\nseeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over\nagain, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would\nhave done),--and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is\nlet go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea\nof seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been\nattached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate\npossibilities.\n\nIt sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so\nirresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching\nthe end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he\nmust spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes\nwhile his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to\nher, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in\nwhich he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the\nwealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by\nso abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was\nonce more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact\nwas that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the\ndesire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which\nhad ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to\nhimself--or so, at least, he believed--that he was so easily capable of\nresisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of\nseparation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation\nwhenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back\nto him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence,\nall of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour\nduring this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a\nperiod of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having\nlasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted\nwhat had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be\nsacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to\nresist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by\nhis own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps,\nhave done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result\nthat he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an\nOdette almost unknown.\n\nBut she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was\nonly a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came,\nnow, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase\nof stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these\ncrises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed\nof them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only\nto what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always\nidentical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more\nprofound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of\nview of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed\nto understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each\npersuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event,\nat the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his\ninveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the\nmoment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be\nmisunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance\nto these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him,\nassumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one\nand the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased\nto weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their\ndreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's\nlove had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of\ncertain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether\nto deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still\nreasonable, or indeed possible.\n\nCertainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge.\nWhen he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it\ndiminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate\nliking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was\nin love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded\ncomplexion, returned on certain days. \"Really, I am making distinct\nheadway,\" he would tell himself on the morrow, \"when I come to think it\nover carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night,\nout of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought\nher ugly.\" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long\nway beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed,\nno longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the\nphotograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he\nhad difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the\npasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his\nmind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, \"It is she!\" as\nwhen suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one\nof our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are\nsuffering. \"She?\"--he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it\nis something like love, like death (rather than like those vague\nconceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in\nquestion, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear\nthat the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape\nour grasp--the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was\nSwann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all\nhis habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his\nsleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so\nentirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it\naway without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case\nwas past operation.\n\nBy this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests\nthat when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding\nhimself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting\n(although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate\nof its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's\neyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his\nlove itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by\nseeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would\nfeel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and\namong people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure\nas he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were\ndepicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used\nto enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the\nsmartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the\nsoundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in\nSaint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of\ndaily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the\nshrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which\nthis detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which\nSwann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few\nand distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his\nlove and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my\ngreat-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more\nindividual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most\ndelighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de\nParme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette,\nby letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of\nthing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite\nsure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of\nhis mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written\nto him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit\nat the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they\nwere, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always\nhad the best, am soon, \"every fruit visited and examined, one by one,\nby myself.\" And in the sequel, by the cordiality with which the\nPrincess thanked him, he had been able to judge of the flavour of the\nstrawberries and of the ripeness of the pears. But, most of all, that\n\"every fruit visited and examined one by one, by myself\" had brought\nbalm to his sufferings by carrying his mind off to a region which he\nrarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich\nand respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from\ngeneration to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art\nof ordering things from shops.\n\nOf a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to\nfeel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure\nthan he was capable of feeling at other times--when, indeed, he was\ngrown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class\npeople, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was\nless animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for\nall that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from\nrespect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely\nentertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which\nasked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the\nfamily of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up'\nwith him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had\ninvited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by\nsight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the\nson, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann.\n\nBut, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of\nthem, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his\nhouse, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon\nhis brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid\ncomfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the\nfine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the\nthought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the\nhouse, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would\nbe the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg\nand the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old\nFran�oise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried\nin her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so\nexquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and\npatience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which\nin her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually\nof wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of\nall,--since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference\nto Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed\nfeeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome\nto her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins'\n'faithful,'--when he betook himself to a world in which he was the\nparamount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract,\nwhom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to\nbelieve in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite\nfor it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a\nstrict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an\nofficial banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily.\n\nIf he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not\npaying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her\nthat he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking\nhimself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps\nexhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her,\nit would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each\nvisit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some\ninformation which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually\ngoing to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him.\nAnd, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her\nat once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of\nconversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say\nto Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking\nhim to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home\nin vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his\ndevice had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now\nfrequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her;\nthat she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, \"I am always\nfree\" and \"What can it matter to me, what other people think?\" now,\nwhenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded\nsome engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a\nprivate view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would\nexpostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that\nhe was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a\npitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden\nto meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply\nattached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also\nhad been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue\nde Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it\nhappened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my\nuncle, a poetical tone, saying: \"Ah, he! He is not in the least\nlike you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his\nfriendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little\nconsideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in\npublic.\" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what\nrhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my\nuncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, _a priori_, the axiom\nof her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible\nvirtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. \"I should\nlike to speak to you about her,\" he went on, \"you, who know what a woman\nsupreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette\nis. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see\nOdette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her.\nAnd so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly;\nshe won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now\nyou, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few\nwords for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm\nwhich my bowing to her in the street might do her?\"\n\nMy uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she\nwould love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her\neverywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told\nSwann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that\nmy uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault.\nShe calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my\nuncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met\nagain. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if\nhe had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk\nthings over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to\nthrow a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had\nled, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the\nwinter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there,\nperhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one\nhad let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been\nOdette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he\nwould, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to\nlearn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them,\nincorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted\nthem, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only,\neach one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the\npicture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt\nthat he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would\nnever have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden\nor Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in\none or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety.\nHe attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with\ncertain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette,\nand, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their\nheads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom,\nup till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that\npertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that\nhe learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those\npleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been\nsolely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no\nlonger felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any\nmoment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and\ndizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had\nbeen engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's _Septennat_,\nin which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer\nbeneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but\nsplendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he\nwould have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant\ndetails that made up the daily round on the C�te d'Azur in those days,\nif it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled\nhim in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does\nthe aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century\nFlorence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the\nPrimavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit,\noften, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming;\nand she would comment: \"You do look sad!\" It was not very long since,\nfrom the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best\nwomen that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and\nyet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de\nCr�cy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies'\nmen' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so\noften gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself:\n\"What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who\nOdette de Cr�cy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true,\nare always based upon other people's ideas\"; he would reflect that this\nlegend--even if it were authentic--was something external to Odette,\nwas not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality;\nthat the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank\neyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body\nwhich he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers,\na woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he\nsucceeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was,\noften tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish\npreoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would\npush back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would\nseem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some\nworthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a\nmoment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would\nflash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of\nher face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which,\nsuddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment\nof the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even\nthe future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have\nshared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on\nthem. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the\nprocess of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the\nintervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette\ncompact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on\n(as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the\nother Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments\nwere, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening\nmeetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she\nwould be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she\nwished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her.\nShe would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of\nthe very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann\ncome to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the\nevening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she\nwould jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet\nprogressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the\nmoment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with\nirresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into\nher mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look\nwell, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair\nover her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden\ntassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to\nrestrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: \"So that is how\nyou thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought\nI was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!\"\nSometime... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he\nwould find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive\nalliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him.\nBut anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it\nwas very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable\nacquaintance, some one who knew--if only indirectly--the man with\nwhom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of\ninformation about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends,\nasking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other,\nhe would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions\nto which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the\nstrain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for\nsuch information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us,\nalways, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know\nwe do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can\ndispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of\npower to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was\nwith Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward\ncould ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it\nwas out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty\nabout telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had\ndeclared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see\nher on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly\nto some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact\nthat M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring\nto put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing\nnot quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each\nof which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very\nsoon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of\ndissipations.\n\n\"But what do you mean, my dear M�m�, I don't quite understand.... You\ndidn't go straight from her house to the Mus�e Gr�vin? Surely you went\nsomewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing\nyou are, my dear M�m�. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat\nNoir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange.\nAfter all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people\nthere? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat\nthere like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you,\nsitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear M�m�; I'm exceedingly\nfond of you.\"\n\nSwann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when\ntalking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he\nhardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance,\n\"I saw Mme. de Cr�cy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.\"),\nsentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid\nstate, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay\nthere irremovable,--how charming, by way of contrast, were the words:\n\"She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul.\" How freely they\ncoursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to\nbreathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette\nmust find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred\nto his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him,\npained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.\n\nEven when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have\nsufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's\npresence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific\nwhich in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the\ndisease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it\nwould have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her\nhouse while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return,\ninto whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there,\nall memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed\nspell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she\nwould not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form\nvarious plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage,\nwhile he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his\nmind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going\nto see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into\nbed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready\nto sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious,\nso habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he\nburst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying\nwith a smile: \"This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic.\" After\nwhich he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought\nthat, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette\nhad been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This\ncompulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without\nresult, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over\nhis stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a\ntumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with\nanything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his\nlife, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed,\nat this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even\nto himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so\nmuch from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his\nstruggle.\n\nAnd yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no\nlonger loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when\nat length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone\nto see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of\nForcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was\nin love with some one else would distract his mind from the question\nof Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new\ndevelopments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little\ntime to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even\ndays when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was\ncured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place\nthe same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were,\ndiluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred\nfrom its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had\nawakened him.\n\nSince Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important\nmatters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived\nlong enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything\nelse than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the\neffort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would\npass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have\nwiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There\nemerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which\nreappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some\nobligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as\nthey were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning\nas preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the\nnecessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which\nshe referred, from time to time, to \"the day when I go with my friend\nto the Hippodrome,\" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, \"Perhaps\nOdette would be kind and come to see me,\" he remembered, suddenly, that\nit was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an \"Oh,\nno! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it\nbefore, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome.\nWe must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time\nin proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in\nadvance.\" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the\nHippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely\nineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed\nto make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely\nconnected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the\nsalute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied\nto his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or\nthree paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for\ninstance, she said: \"That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the\nother day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,\" that explanation would\nset Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that\nthis friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the\nHippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any\ncoherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her,\nthat friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to\ninvite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed\nall his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of\nseeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He\nwould have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for\nqueens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in\ntheir knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for\nhis pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with\none or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly\nrelations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity\nof nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the\nattics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never\ntook him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker,\nwhose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been\nvisited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost\nslums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful,\nnourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead\nindefinitely.\n\nIt sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw\nsome man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon\nOdette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he\nhad come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on\nthe days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread\nof what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the\npredominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking\ncontrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction\nfrom the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship,\nshe had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a\nletter to him with the words: \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can\nscarcely write.\" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that\nemotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to\nenlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our\nhands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love.\nWhen they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy,\nhow bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing\nto him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had\nsought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating\nopportunities for saying \"my\" and \"mine\" when she referred to him: \"You\nare all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I\nshall keep it,\" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of\na single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days,\nwhatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: \"You know,\nyou will never be like other people!\"--she would gaze at his long,\nslightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes\nused to think: \"He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is\nsmart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!\" and, with more curiosity\nperhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress,\nshe would sigh:\n\n\"I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!\"\n\nBut, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes\nof irritation, sometimes indulgent: \"Ah! so you never will be like other\npeople!\"\n\nShe would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent\nanxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process\nwhich enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music\nof which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child\nwhose family one has known: \"He's not positively ugly, if you like,\nbut he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!\"\nrealising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible\nboundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent\nlover from a cuckold's), and would say:\n\n\"Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of\nyours.\"\n\nAlways ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only\nOdette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling\nhimself greedily upon her words: \"You can if you like,\" he would tell\nher.\n\nAnd he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to\nmake him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women\nasked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though\nit is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble\ntask would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and\nintolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. \"If she didn't love me,\njust a little,\" he told himself, \"she would not wish to have me altered.\nTo alter me, she will have to see me more often.\" And so he was able to\ntrace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of\nher interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so\nlittle, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of\nher interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she\nforbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his\ncoachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and,\nanyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders\nwhich she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her\nsay: \"Don't have him again when you come to me,\" just as he might have\nwanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he\nwas deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom\nhe had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the\nmost trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never\nheard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to\nhim:\n\n\"I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now,\nand she certainly takes an interest in what I do.\"\n\nAnd if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his\ncarriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way,\nhis friend said: \"Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?\" with what\nmelancholy joy would Swann answer him:\n\n\"Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I\ngo to the Rue La P�rouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she\nthinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know,\nwomen. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to\ntake R�mi there; I should never hear the last of it!\"\n\nThese new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now\nadopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise\nhow much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day\nafter day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly\ncontrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he\ncould have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now\nthis change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and\nnight, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it,\nhe would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made\nto suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: \"There\nwas a time when Odette loved me more,\" but he never formed any definite\npicture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he\ncontrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever\nhe entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked\naway the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first\nevenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in\nwhich she said: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never\nhave let you have that back,\" and \"At whatever hour of the day or night\nyou may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,\"\nso there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his\nthoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by\na long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within\nreach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days.\n\nBut his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone\nout to a party.\n\nIt was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season,\nof the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians\nwho would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had\nintended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never\nbeen able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this\nparty, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to\ngo with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in\nhelping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a\nlittle less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:\n\n\"You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the\ngreatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead\nto see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I\ndon't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to\nsee her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went\nwith her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try\nto keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you\ncould arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something\nthat we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for\nthe summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we\nmight all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon\nseeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or\nif you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so\nmany thanks for all you are doing for me--you know what I feel about\nyou!\"\n\nHis friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had\ndeposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived\nsoothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening\nin the Rue La P�rouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to\neverything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details\nof fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is\nto be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,\nappears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the\nforeground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which\nhostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions,\nand in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and\nsetting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of\nBalzac's 'tigers'--now 'grooms'--. who normally followed their mistress\nwhen she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out\nof doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the\nstables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of\ntheir several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always\nhad to look for analogies between living people and the portraits\nin galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more\ngeneral form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached\nfrom it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the\ncloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of\nfashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in\nevening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there,\nhis mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in\nit, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the\nparty into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for\nthe first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest,\nthe scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen\nwho were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until,\npointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet\nand gathered in a circle round about him.\n\nOne of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the\nheadsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions,\ntortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take\nhis 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by\nthe softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached\nSwann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his\nperson and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to\nwhich the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost\nover-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching\nby the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of\nhis satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that\noverpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and\ndisplayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of\nits captivity.\n\nA few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing,\nmotionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior\nwhom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in\ndreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and\nbloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were\nthronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in\nthe scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as\nif it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint\nJames. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race--if,\nindeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the\nfrescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and\nwhere it still dreams--fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue\nby some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons.\nAnd the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his\nhead by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek\nsculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which,\nif in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to\nextract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed,\nas it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair,\nby the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the\noverlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can\nsuggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of\nhyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal,\nwere disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their\ndecorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be\nnamed, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the\n'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by\nthe thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would\nhe, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck\nflights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly\nhave paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to\nspend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the\nprivilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in\nthe habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account,\nseemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his\nmistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything\nthat he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to\nthe old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the\nbuilding, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed\nmilk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat;\non the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment\nclimbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each\nanfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or\nthe entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor\nservice which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests,\na gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest\nof the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by\nthemselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the\nplebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate),\nscrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had\nbeen heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant\nlivery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not\nfeel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway,\ntheir splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like\nsaints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard\nfashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff\nas each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up\nwhich he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and\na small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's\nsacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in\nwhich the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers,\nrose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a\nlittle hall which--just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners\nto serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they\ntake their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else\nbesides--displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy\nby Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body\nslightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more\ncrimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire,\ntimidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that\nscreened the door of the room in which the music was being given with\nhis impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly\nimpassibility or a supernatural faith--an allegory of alarums,\nincarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot--to be looking out,\nangel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the\napproach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to\nenter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an\nusher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering\nto him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house\nin which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but\npermitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a\ndoor-mat wrung his heart.\n\nHe speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human\nmale when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of\nthe servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of\nfaces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new\nand uncanny, now that their features,--instead of being to him symbols\nof practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who\nuntil then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after,\nboredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged--were at rest,\nmeasurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their\ncurves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now\nfound himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many\nof them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled\nSwann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted\nto the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not\nnow strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because\nhe did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Br�aute, who\nwere talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two\nfigures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who\nhad put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the\nGeneral's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred,\nvictorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it\nleft half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops,\nappeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious\nto receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while\nthat which M. de Br�aute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey\ngloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar\npair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore,\nglued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the\nmicroscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and\nnever ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness\nof parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of\nrefreshments.\n\n\"Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,\" the General\ngreeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and\nconcluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away,\nwent on, \"You're looking well, old man!\" while M. de Br�aut� turned\nwith, \"My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?\" to a 'society\nnovelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his\nown monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological\ninvestigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now\nreplied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':--\"I am\nobserving!\"\n\nThe Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by\nenforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it\nwas incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there\nwas inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a\nmelancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering\nterribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cand�, girdled, like\nSaturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which\ncomposed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while\nhis thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their\ngrimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled\nin the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing\neyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set\ndreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and\nthen, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and\ngoggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings,\nunlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of\nhis orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an\naccidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of\nhis aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to\nSwann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that\nInjustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests\nthat enshroud his secret lair.\n\nSwann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from _Orfeo_ which was\nbeing rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner\nfrom which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of\n'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the\nVicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend\ntheir time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her\nbag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at\na railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved,\nby marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs;\nMme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more\nglad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary,\nwas extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all\nher fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure\ncountry cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled\nwith ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the\npianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds')\nwhich came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy\nflight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head,\nas though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were\na series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing,\na hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of\nastonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: \"It isn't\npossible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all\nthat!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical\neducation, beating time with her head--transformed for the nonce into\nthe pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements\nfrom one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild\nabandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to\nanalyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely \"I can't\nhelp it\") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught\nin the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the\nbunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any\ninterruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side\n(and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de\nGallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own\nkinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly\nand in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most\nbrilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her,\nperhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a\nscandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the\nfamily, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself\nseated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment\nnext to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that\nher own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made\nexternally manifest in visible character like those which, in the\nmosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a\nvertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he\nis supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact\nthat she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young\ncousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already\nelapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with\nanger--and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who\nexpressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it\nwas because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there--a\ndegradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists,\nwould never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that\nthis actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She\nremembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des\nLaumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in\na confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly\nhumiliating reminiscence by murmuring, \"After all, it isn't for me to\ntake the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is.\" And\nfortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back\nuntil they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which\nlay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head\nof a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its\nfeathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having\nbeen endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but\nsuccessive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may\nobserve in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice\nand are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she\nwas obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level\nwith the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that\nit was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride\nthat she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually\nremoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was\naccepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at\ntimes, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs.\nHad anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of\nanalysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms\nwould furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at\nonce have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms\nof speech, occurred in it nearly so often as \"at my cousins the\nGuermantes's,\" \"at my aunt Guermantes's,\" \"Elz�ar de Guermantes's\nhealth,\" \"my cousin Guermantes's box.\" If anyone spoke to her of a\ndistinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not\npersonally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at\nher aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone,\nwith such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if\nshe did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the\nobstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders\nwere stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which\ngymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of\nour chests.\n\nAt this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to\nappear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To\nshew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which\nshe had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior\nrank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides,\neven when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting\nto get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being\nin her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at\nthe doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his\ncoming; and strictly limiting her field of vision--so as not to seem to\nbe advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her\ndue--to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she\nstood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and\nfrom which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was\nnoticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know.\nShe observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her\npassion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to\nsay that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme.\nde Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished\n(so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by\ncoming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly\nand obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she\ncalled 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see\nthat she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was\nnot in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although\nsuch displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of\nthat spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the\nmost self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment,\neven though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself\nwhether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary\nconcomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which,\nit might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had\never heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of\nher own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards\nthe lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a\ncompromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment\nshe would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden\nhair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny\ndiamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with\na cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would\nbeat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her\nindependence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When\nhe had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin,\nMme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile,\nfull of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of\na competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her\ngirlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures,\nthe phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by\nseeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of\nthe direction in which they started, the point which one might have\nexpected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those\nfantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately--with a more\npremeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which,\nif you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish--to\nclutch at one's heart.\n\nBrought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors,\nhardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude\nof her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now\npassionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing\ncouples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment\nto listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of\nthe lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different\nfrom anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender\nyoung man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white\ngloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed\nto have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the\nesteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its\ncharm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in\nit more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess.\nMme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her\nyoung daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family,\nexcept in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having\n'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially\nenlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him\nplayed. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian,\nwho was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries,\nMme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories\nand sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though\nwithout any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen\nyears earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of\nher life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the\ndaughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead.\nBut her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and\nthen in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other\nrespects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a\npiano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully\naware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which\nthe pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The\nclosing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her\nlips. And she murmured \"How charming it is!\" with a stress on the\nopening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which\nshe felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a\nbeautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into\nharmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental\ngaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to\nherself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting\nthe Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not\nacknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room.\nA movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once\nMme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours;\nalthough determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which\nshould remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on\nfriendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any\nday, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not\nher duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,'\nshe felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some\nnon-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force\nthe Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her\ncousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust\nout as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: \"How is\nyour husband?\" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the\nPrince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which\nwas one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the\nrest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to\nenhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated\nlips and sparkling eyes, answered: \"Why; he's never been better in his\nlife!\" And she went on laughing.\n\nMme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression\nstill further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's\nhealth, said to her cousin:\n\n\"Oriane,\" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment\ntowards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she\nhad never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) \"I\nshould be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow\nevening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like\nto have your opinion of it.\"\n\nShe seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking\nfavour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just\nthough it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was\nmost important that an epicure should come to judge.\n\n\"But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now--that I adore\nit.\"\n\n\"You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like\nso much to see you,\" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal\nwork of charity for the Princess to appear at her party.\n\nThe Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their\nhouses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having\nbeen kept away--by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an\ninvitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the\ncountry--from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of\ngoing. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that\nshe was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to\ntheir houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some\nprincely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with\ntheir own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that\nwitty 'Guermantes set'--in which there survived something of the\nalert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional\nsentiments, which dated from M�rim�e, and found its final expression in\nthe plays of Meilhac and Hal�vy--she adapted its formula so as to suit\neven her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was\nalways struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to\nthe plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the\nexpression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more\npleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it\nwould depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come.\n\n\"Listen, and I'll explain,\" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. \"To-morrow\nevening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix\na day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't\npossibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in\nthe house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away.\"\n\n\"Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?\"\n\n\"No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must\ncatch his eye.\"\n\n\"It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,\" Mme. de\nGallardon went on. \"Oh, I know he's very clever,\" meaning by that 'very\ncunning,' \"but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the\nsister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.\"\n\n\"I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,\" said the\nPrincesse des Laumes.\n\n\"I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and\ngrandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are\nworse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just\na pretence; is that true, d'you think?\"\n\n\"I can throw no light at all on the matter.\"\n\nThe pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after\nfinishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme.\nde Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin\nhimself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in\nturn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She\nbelonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the\nuntiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it\ndoes not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it\ndoes. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in\nany room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set,\neven although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy\nher mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that\nmoment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess\ncould do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is\nput down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which\nwere crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with\nthe least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the\ndirection where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the\ncourse of her magnetic smile.\n\n\"Oriane, don't be angry with me,\" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could\nnever restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions,\nand the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would\ndazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying\nsomething disagreeable, \"people do say about your M. Swann that he's the\nsort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?\"\n\n\"Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,\" replied the\nPrincesse des Laumes, \"for you must have asked him a hundred times, and\nhe's never been to your house once.\"\n\nAnd leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a\nlaugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music,\nbut attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed,\nout of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now\nfor the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted\nto see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes,\nlooking after her father-in-law, who was ill.\n\n\"My dear Princess, you here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such\nlovely things.\"\n\n\"What, you've been in the room quite a time?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long\nbecause I couldn't see you.\"\n\nMme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who\ndeclined it with:\n\n\"Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where\nI sit.\" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the\nsimplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: \"There\nnow, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back\nstraight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling\nyou to have me 'chucked out'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the\nmusic-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments\nabout on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every\nother 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him,\nwhich he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told\nthat a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously,\ntrying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her\ngratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so\ndelightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm\nthan Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she\nfollowed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's\nfate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each\n_fortissimo_, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to\nspill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer,\nand, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood,\nflung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her\nhand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished,\nand the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn\nby this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her\nand the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was\nfavourable on the whole.\n\n\"Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?\" asked General de\nFroberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her\nfor a moment. \"Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?\"\n\n\"No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,\" replied the Princess carelessly,\nand then, with more animation: \"I am only repeating what I heard just\nnow, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one\nbehind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in\nthe country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be\n'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly\n'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've\nno idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose\nthey do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's\nparties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs\nand the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're\nrather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire\nthe same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!\"\n\n\"Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,\" protested the\nGeneral.\n\n\"I see no objection to its being old,\" the Princess answered dryly, \"but\nwhatever else it is it's not euphonious,\" she went on, isolating the\nword euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation\nto which the Guermantes set were addicted.\n\n\"You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,\" said the\nGeneral, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. \"Don't you\nagree with me, Princess?\"\n\n\"She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman,\nthat's not very nice--for I don't suppose she's my generation,\" replied\nMme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon\nand Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still\ngazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the\nlady, half wishing to oblige the General: \"Not very nice... for her\nhusband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract\nyou so much; I might have introduced you to her,\" said the Princess,\nwho, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done\nnothing of the sort. \"And now I must say good night, because one of\nmy friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many\nhappy returns,\" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the\nfashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions\nof a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was\nobliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her\nappearance. \"Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's\ngone to see those friends of his--you know them too, I'm sure,--who are\ncalled after a bridge--oh, yes, the I�nas.\"\n\n\"It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!\"\nsaid the General. \"I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,\" he went\non, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying\na fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess\ninstinctively looked away, \"that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's\nnot the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine\nof its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.\"\n\n\"But I have the deepest respect for heroes,\" the Princess assented,\nthough with a faint trace of irony. \"If I don't go with Basin to see\nthis Princesse d'I�na, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because\nI don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not\nwhat you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face\nagainst! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face\nagainst them?\" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that,\never since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his\nfascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. \"Anyhow,\nit isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they\ndo him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell\nyou what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you\nimagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!\"\n\n\"But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their\ngrandparents.\"\n\n\"I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I\nquite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least\nthey needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say?\nI can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that\nhideous style--cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like\nbath-taps!\"\n\n\"But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why,\nthey must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough\nfrom the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be\nbeautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that\nmyself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in\nthe attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all,\nthat's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even\ngo to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them,\nbut--I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a\nlittle girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know.\"\nShe assumed a tone of childish gravity. \"And so I am just doing what\nI was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally\nstrange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile\nreception.\"\n\nAnd she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had\nbrought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the\nGeneral, a gentle, dreamy expression.\n\n\"My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy.\"\n\n\"No, why?\" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem\nunaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in\nFrance, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell\nher so. \"Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most\nunpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them,\nbut if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see\nthe people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know\nas well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad.\nBesides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite\napart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in\nsociety. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party,\nbut if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one\ndown...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for,\nto make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big\n'crushes.' And as I never give any...\"\n\n\"Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You\nhave your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!\"\n\n\"But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could\nmake out why. Do you really know any others who have it?\" she rallied\nhim, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked\nto the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with\na radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such\nspeeches--even if the Princess had to make them herself--as were in\npraise of her wit or of her beauty. \"Look, there's Swann talking to your\nCambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see\nhim? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!\"\n\n\"Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?\" asked the General.\n\n\"My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think\nhe didn't want to see me!\"\n\nSwann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of\nher recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all\nthat country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not\nto be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic,\nhalf-amorous--with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess--a\nmanner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment\ninto the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words,\nfor his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at\nonce to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes,\nfor whom he was speaking, \"Behold our charming Princess! See, she has\ncome up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the\nbirds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go\nand pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are\neven some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost\nwhich must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty\nindeed, my dear Princess.\"\n\n\"What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too\nwonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,\" Mme. de Saint-Euverte\nprotested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's\nway of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress,\n\"Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not\nchestnuts, no,--oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess\nhave known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't\ntell me, even.\"\n\nSwann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept\nup the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate\ncompliments which most other people would not and need not understand,\ndid not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had\nbeen speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of\nlaughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set,\nand because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself\nwithout finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing.\n\n\"Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with\nyour approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person,\nare you also her neighbour in the country?\"\n\nMme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy\ntalking to Swann, had drifted away.\n\n\"But you are, yourself, Princess!\"\n\n\"I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I\nwish I had!\"\n\n\"No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used\nto come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are\nComtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.\"\n\n\"I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched'\nfor a hundred francs, every year, by the Cur�, which is a due that I\ncould very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a\nstartling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!\" she said with\na laugh.\n\n\"It begins no better.\" Swann took the point.\n\n\"Yes; that double abbreviation!\"\n\n\"Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first\nword.\"\n\n\"But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done\nbetter to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in\nthe most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of\ntaste--but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,\" she went on in\na coaxing tone, \"I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not\nmake that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the\nname Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only\nwhen I see you that I stop feeling bored.\"\n\nWhich was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way\nof looking at the little things of life--the effect, if not the cause of\nwhich was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of\npronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things\ncould have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the\ntrouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that\nenwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one\nfound that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they\nhad the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and\nthe Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so\nmelancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes\na flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that\na murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard\nthe Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much\ncomforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette.\n\n\"Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear\nfriend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could\nspend a most pleasant evening together.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law\nwould be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but\nI must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a\nhorror of 'picturesque spots'.\"\n\n\"I know it well, it's delightful!\" replied Swann. \"It's almost too\nbeautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to\nbe happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there\nspeak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields\nbegin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that\nI am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's\nedge... I should be quite wretched!\"\n\n\"Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon\nwoman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what\nit was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off\nher daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),--perhaps both--to\neach other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince...\nPretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and\ninvite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now\nthat I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you\noff and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased\nto see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me\nthere. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from M�m�... Remember,\nI never see you at all now!\"\n\nSwann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the\nrisk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message\nwhich he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one\nof the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find\nleft with his own porter, at home.\n\n\"Poor Swann,\" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; \"he is\nalways charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see\nfor yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I\ndo feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should\nlet himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even\ninteresting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!\" she concluded\nwith the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love\nthemselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such\npersons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished\nthat anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so\ninsignificant a creature as the common bacillus.\n\nSwann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape,\nGeneral de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme.\nde Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for\nher.\n\n\"I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by\nsavages, what do you say?\"\n\nThe words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once\nhe felt the need of continuing the conversation. \"Ah!\" he began, \"some\nfine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that\nexplorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La P�rouse...\"\n(and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). \"He was\na fine character, and interests me very much, does La P�rouse,\" he ended\nsadly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course, La P�rouse,\" said the General. \"It's quite a\nwell-known name. There's a street called that.\"\n\n\"Do you know anyone in the Rue La P�rouse?\" asked Swann excitedly.\n\n\"Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre.\nShe gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house\nthat will be really smart some day, you'll see!\"\n\n\"Oh, so she lives in the Rue La P�rouse. It's attractive; I like that\nstreet; it's so sombre.\"\n\n\"Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at\nall sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there.\"\n\nWhen Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de\nCambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's\nname, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise\nwith which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole\nof her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the\nfriends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she\nassumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew\nher tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her\nmarriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which\nwas meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to\novercome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame\nit. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most\neminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more\nthat they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have\nyielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her\nconsiderable fortune.\n\n\"It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,\" said\nthe General, alluding to the incident of the candle.\n\nMeanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not\nnow go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being\nshut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded\nhim all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable,\nhad they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than\nsmile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of\ninsanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective\nstate which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing\nexternal to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which\neven the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to\nprolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in\nwhich no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was\nentirely absent.\n\nBut suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore\nhim with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What\nhad happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes,\non which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which\nit prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation\nwith which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a\ndesperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before\nitself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its\nremaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a\ndoor open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had\nhad time to understand what was happening, to think: \"It is the little\nphrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!\", all his memories of\nthe days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded,\nup till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being,\ndeceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they\nsupposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken\nwing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his\npresent desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness.\n\nIn place of the abstract expressions \"the time when I was happy,\" \"the\ntime when I was loved,\" which he had often used until then, and without\nmuch suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything\nof the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the\nreality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the\npeculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all;\nthe snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed\nafter him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the\naddress 'Maison Dor�e,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read\n\"My hand trembles so as I write to you,\" the frowning contraction of her\neyebrows when she said pleadingly: \"You won't let it be very long before\nyou send for me?\"; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he\nused to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little\nworking girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that\nspring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all\nthe network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory\nreactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes,\nby which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he\nhad been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures\nof those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could\nstop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also;\nhow small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with\nthat formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around\nher, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and\nnight what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all\ntimes and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had\nexclaimed: \"But I can see you at any time; I am always free!\"--she, who\nwas never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in\nhis life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour--of\nwhich it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious\nwaste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements--of granting her\naccess to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let\nher take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to\nhim once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be\nswayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of\ntheir seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when\nto him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that\ntime, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself\nof it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need.\nLittle had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting,\nas she repeated: \"But why don't you let me come to you oftener?\" he had\ntold her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of\nforming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that\nshe wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a\nprinted address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart.\n\"Written from the H�tel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone\nthere for? With whom? What happened there?\" He remembered the gas-jets\nthat were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he\nhad met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that\nnight which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that\nnight of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would\nbe annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he\nthat she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take\nher home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may\nreturn again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish,\nstanding, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived\nagain, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he\ndid not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head,\nlest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was\nhimself.\n\nWhen he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that\nother self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he\nhad so often said, without much suffering: \"Perhaps she's in love with\nthem,\" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in\nwhich there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the\n'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love.\nAnd then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his\nforehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And\ndoubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would\nhave added to the collection of the monocles which he had already\nidentified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying\nthought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his\nhandkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares.\n\nThere are in the music of the violin--if one does not see the instrument\nitself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies\nthe fullness of the sound--accents which are so closely akin to those\nof certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has\ntaken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only\nthe wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is\nstill tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one\nbelieves that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the\ndarkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a\ndevil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the\nair, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the\near, as it passes, its invisible message.\n\nAs though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little\nphrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would\nconsent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary\nto procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its\napparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had\nbelonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something\nlike the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness\nwith which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it\nwas present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so\nas to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to\nspeak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And\nas she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume\nof a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which\nhe closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made\ninvoluntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him,\nthe harmonious, fleeting form.\n\nHe felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who\naddressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he\nhad no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not\nknown to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their\njoys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And\nindeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of\nsuffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation,\nto-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was\nalmost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken\nto him then, which he had seen it--without his being touched by them\nhimself--carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of\nthose sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope\nof being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once\nit had said of his happiness: \"What does all that matter; it is all\nnothing.\" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave\nof pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown,\nexalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his\nlife have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have\ndrawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?\n\nWhen it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his\nsufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a\nlittle while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that\nhe could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard\nhis love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the\nlittle phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short\nduration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as\neveryone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but,\non the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy\nof the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow,\n'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and\neven their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and\nin appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them,\nthe little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it\nmade their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by\nall those same onlookers--provided only that they were in any sense\nmusical--who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real\nlife, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes.\nDoubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be\nanalysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year\nbefore, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love\nof music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann\nhad regarded musical _motifs_ as actual ideas, of another world, of\nanother order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by\nthe human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from\nanother, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When,\nafter that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little\nphrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his\nconfused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress,\nit swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the\ncloseness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and\nto the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression\nof a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he\nwas basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon\ncertain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the\nmysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the\nVerdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard\nthe sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still\nfurther the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field\nopen to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an\nimmeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which,\nhere and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored\ntracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of\npassion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing\nfrom all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been\ndiscovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they\nawaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have\nfound, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to\nus, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration,\nof our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and\nwaste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little\nphrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there\nwas contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which\nthe phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once\nheard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of\ntheir minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and\nhappiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was\npeculiar as he would know of the _Princesse de Cl�ves_, or of _Ren�_,\nshould either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not\nthinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the\nsame way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such\nas our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the\nrich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned.\nPerhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we\nreturn to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no\nmore bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known\nthem than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for\nexample, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in\nview of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has\nvanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase,\nlike some theme, say, in _Tristan_, which represents to us also a\ncertain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had\nendued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was\nlinked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one\nof the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being\nthat is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence;\nbut, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these\nconceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either.\nWe shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who\nshall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something\nless bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain.\n\nSo Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata\ndid, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it\nbelonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we\nhave never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim\nwith rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one\nforth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access\nto shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what\nVinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer\nhad been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to\ndraw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its\noutlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure,\nthat the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a\nshadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some\nmore bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he\nbelieved in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an\near at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture\nhad Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms,\nsought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own\ninvention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand.\n\nThe phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the\nend of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's\npianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable\nideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and\nwhich he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory,\ndivested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened\nto all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of\nthe phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a\nsyllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. \"Audacity,\"\nhe exclaimed to himself, \"as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an\nAmpere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering\nthe secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region\nunexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he\nhas placed his trust and which he never may discern!\" How charming\nthe dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the\nbeginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far\nfrom letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought),\nhad eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such\ninflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such\nobvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird\ndeserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a\nneighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as\nif there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this\nworld closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its\ncreator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world\nof this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of\nthe little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose\nplaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden\nthat the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they\ncame. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame,\nto woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the\nlittle phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the\nviolinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to\nspeak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that\nthe strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself\nface to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those\nsobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring\nfrom us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to\na friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose\nprobable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain\npoised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though\nimmobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the\nprecious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an\niridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when\nits brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it\nis extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever\nshewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to\nappear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and\nmade them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all\nthe other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest\nmovement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious,\nfrail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed\nof speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent,\nperhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive),\nbreathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to\narrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on\nwhich a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on\nwhich a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when\nthe phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated\namong the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann\nat first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her\nimbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions,\nbefore even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from\nsmiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was\nincapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the\nvirtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: \"It's\nastonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...\" But a scrupulous\nregard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added\nthe reservation: \"anything to beat it... since the table-turning!\"\n\nFrom that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had\nonce had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would\nnot be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had\nonce more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him\nany attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of\na slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and\nsceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when\nthey are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady,\nrelate, as significant facts of infinite value: \"Yesterday he went\nthrough his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we\nhad made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to\nenjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet\nto-morrow,\"--although they themselves know that these things are\nmeaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was\nassured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he\nwould gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have\nbeen glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have\nhad the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go.\n\nHe had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon\nhis essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to\nThe Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of\nDiana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt\nsale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have\nliked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen\nhis conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when\nshe was not there--for in strange places where our sensations have not\nbeen numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain--was for him so\ncruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it\nincessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in\nhis determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen\nthat, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him\n(without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and\nwould be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a\nyear; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the\nplatform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade\nthis young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke\nin alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see\nOdette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being\nstill deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special\ncircumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could\nremain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow\nhim to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages:\nhis social position--his fortune, from which she stood too often in\nneed of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture\n(having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry\nher)--his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed,\nhad never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him\nthe pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things\nsaid about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an\nesteem--and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in\nweaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not\nagreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette--he thought of what might\nhave happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he\nthought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble,\nwithout resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to\nhim, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged\nto part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so\nrecent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: \"People don't\nknow when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they\nare.\" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for\nseveral years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should\nlast for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his\nfriends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a\nmeeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he\nasked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances\nthat had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had\nnot done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be\ndesired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in\ndreams--his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not\nknow when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they\nsupposed.\n\nSometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she\nwho was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares,\nfrom morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he\nmarvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which\nwas able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that\nenvironed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret\ndesire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the\nsoul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its\ncareer of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very\ncordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he\nadmired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of\nhis wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly\nrelates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed\nof thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to\ndeserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's\nvery life.\n\nSince he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent\nreturn, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations\nhis grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would,\nperhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave\nParis for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her\none prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had\nabundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it\nthe grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in\nhim by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the\ndays through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency\nin his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him\nany intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing\nstream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed\nto penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice\nimmobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and\nSwann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass\nwhich pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain\nto burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a\nmalicious smile: \"Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide.\nHe's going to Egypt!\" and Swann had at once understood that this meant:\n\"I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.\" And, in fact,\nif, a few days later, Swann began: \"About that trip that you told me you\nwere going to take with Forcheville,\" she would answer carelessly: \"Yes,\nmy dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the\nPyramids.\" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's\nmistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He\nknew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she\nwould not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained\nhis curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making\nhimself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of\never being loved by her.\n\nOne day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had\nbeen the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among\nthem Forcheville, M. de Br�aut� and the painter) and women, and that she\nfrequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that\nthere was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of\nsending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a\nfamiliarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he\nhad never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other\npeople, those which had no visible connection with what they said.\nAnd when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent\ncharacter of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that\nhe must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might\nhave had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation\nwith Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as\neverything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly\ndisapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with\nthe character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus\nwas somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and\nkind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for\nM. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing\ncircumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would\nact more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable\nto understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M.\nd'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever\nhe thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one\nside, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine\nsincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was\nbecoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover\na little light; until he had the courage to return to those other\nreflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he\nwas forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus\nmight be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a\nneuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that\nSwann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away\nby some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury.\nReally, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes\nwas, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But\nfor that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to\nhim; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold,\nwas as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted\nthat he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people.\nThen he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their\nneighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort,\nanswer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was,\nso far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of\ncausing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But\nwith a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the\nPrince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might\nbe led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was\neverything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking\nin that either, and his relations with Swann--cordial, but scarcely\nintimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views\nabout everything, they found in talking together--were more quiescent\nthan the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be\nled into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by\nwhom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy)\nloved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be\ncalled honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice\nof those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had\nnever felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was\nin thoroughly 'detrimental' society. \"It is not for nothing,\" he now\nassured himself, \"that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour,\ntheir finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are\nsignificant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and\ndes Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour.\nOrsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour.\nHe may have acted dishonourably once again.\" Then he suspected R�mi,\nwho, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt\nhimself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan\nhad his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we\nnot to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our\nown, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and\nvices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find\nthemselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own\nclass? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann\nhad asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined?\nBesides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have\nthought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn,\nBergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire\nonce again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the\nartistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even\nopenly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of\nhonesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them\nwith the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which\nthe want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of\ntheir pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this\nanonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of\nthe most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy\nshould lurk in the depths--which no strange eye might explore--of\nthe warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the\nbusiness-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion\nought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there\nwas not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in\ncertain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then\ncease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two\nor three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief,\nand remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself\nfrequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and\nthe rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were\nincapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human\nlife, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people\nwho were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to\nshake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely\nformal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to\ndrive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they\ndid not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated\nagainst Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other\nmen, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew\nquite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but\nin the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or\nher life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the\npart with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the\nlight of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette,\nif their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or\nan indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would\nruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles\nwhich Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which\nhe himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers,\nwould sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended\nthose habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those\nactions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and\nshe were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather\nas she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some\nother man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have\nstruck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses,\nthat she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led\nthe crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of\nmortals--would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation\nof which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the\ndaily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor\nplace. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people\nmaliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making\nopportune use of some detail--insignificant but true--which he had\naccidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would\nallow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless\nother fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which\nhe carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was\nperfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor\nsuspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make\nalteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in\norder that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as\nhe used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might\nlove a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his\nmistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had\nnot improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which\nOdette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth\nfrom her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very\nfalsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every\nhuman creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much\nas did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less\negotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the\nthings that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust\nand, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be\nhumiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the\nlongest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist\nwithout being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an\ninvitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des\nLaumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being\nplayed, the sight of the title--_Les Filles de Marbre_, by Th�odore\nBarri�re,--struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively\nfrom it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of\nfootlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word\n'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it\npassed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once\nagain, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette\nhad told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at\nthe Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, \"Take\ncare, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of\nmarble.\" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had\nnot attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more\nconfidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter\nreferred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift\nhis eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to\nsee again the words, _Filles de Marbre_, and began to read mechanically\nthe news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel,\nand damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he\nrecoiled again in horror.\n\nThe name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the\nsame district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen,\na second name, to wit Br�aut�, which he had often seen on maps, but\nwithout ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that\nborne by his friend M. de Br�aut�, whom the anonymous letter accused of\nhaving been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Br�aut�,\nthere was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin\nwas concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette\ndid occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never,\nby any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations\nwith Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could\nrecognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their\ninexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby\ncertifying their own innocence), who--as, for instance, Odette,--would\nbe the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one\nanother. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she\nhad scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into\nbeing, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything\nthat he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at\nthat moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration\nwhich reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but\nan odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural\nlaw which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the\nfirst time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years\nbefore: \"Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me.\nI'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with\nher everywhere, and call her by her Christian name.\" So far from seeing\nin these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations,\nintended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since\nrepeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's\nwarm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her\naffection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory\nof her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his\nmind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a\ncertain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return,\nspoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat\ndown, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her,\nnot knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger\nthat a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love\nexpire. Suddenly he made up his mind.\n\n\"Odette, my darling,\" he began, \"I know, I am being simply odious, but I\nmust ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you\nand Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone\nelse, ever?\"\n\nShe shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people\ncommonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would\nbore them to go, when some one has asked, \"Are you coming to watch the\nprocession go by?\", or \"Will you be at the review?\". But this shake of\nthe head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in\nan event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of\nuncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past.\nFurthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than\nany definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette\nthus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it\nwas quite possibly true.\n\n\"I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,\" she added, seeming\nangry and uncomfortable.\n\n\"Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You\nknow quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any\nwoman.'\"\n\nShe repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she\nhoped, thereby, to be rid of him: \"I have never done anything of that\nsort with any woman.\"\n\n\"Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?\"\n\nSwann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that.\n\n\"Oh, you do make me so miserable,\" she cried, with a jerk of her body\nas though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. \"Have\nyou nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have\nmade up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you!\nLook, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice\ntime together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!\"\n\nHowever, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits\nfor a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not\nmake him abandon it.\n\n\"You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in\nthe world, Odette,\" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness.\n\"I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a\ngreat deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession\nwhat makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by\nother people. My anger with you is never due to your actions--I can\nand do forgive you everything because I love you--but to your\nuntruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in\ndenying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall\ncontinue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to\nme a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment\nwhich is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you\nshall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no,\nwhether you have ever done those things.\"\n\n\"How on earth can I tell?\" she was furious. \"Perhaps I have, ever so\nlong ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three\ntimes.\"\n\nSwann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must,\ntherefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities,\nany more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual\nmovement of the clouds overhead, since those words \"two or three times\"\ncarved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A\nstrange thing, indeed, that those words, \"two or three times,\" nothing\nmore than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so\nlacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken\na man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of\nthe remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: \"I have never\nseen anything to beat it since the table-turning.\" The agony that he now\nsuffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in\nthe hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined\nsuch a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that\noffence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular\nhorror which had escaped with the words \"perhaps two or three times,\"\nwas not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything\nthat he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first\ntime. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less\ndear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion\nas his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price\nof the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He\nwished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which\none discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that\nthe horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done \"two or three\ntimes\" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must\nwatch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the\nfaults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment\nto her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he\ndoes! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He\nmight perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any\none woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how\ninsane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when\nhe had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the\npossession--as if that were ever possible--of another person. Happily\nfor Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like\na conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older,\nmore placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ\nwhich at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles\nof a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These\nolder, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's\nstrength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives\none an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an\noperation. This time it was not so much--as it ordinarily was--in\nSwann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took\neffect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have\nonce existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more\nstirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon\nSwann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its\nown accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit\nevenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to\nthe Rue La P�rouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the\nemotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such\nemotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more\nthan a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart,\nto draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble\nhis torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his\njealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would\nhave incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly\nacquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy\nwas not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose\nhis bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was\ninspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not\nhis fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more\nsevere.\n\n\"My darling,\" he began again, \"it's all over now; was it with anyone I\nknow?\"\n\n\"No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really\nwent as far as that.\"\n\nHe smiled, and resumed with: \"Just as you like. It doesn't really\nmatter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were\nable to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking\nof her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't\nbother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a\nclear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what\none cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire\nyou. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have\ndone me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?\"\n\n\"Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long\nago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were\npositively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd\nbe a lot better off!\" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with\nintentional malice.\n\n\"I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only\nnatural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular\nevening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You\nunderstand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with\nwhom, Odette, my love.\"\n\n\"But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one\nevening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with\nthe Princesse des Laumes,\" she added, happy to be able to furnish him\nwith an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. \"At the next\ntable there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to\nme, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight\non the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired,\nand I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been\nanything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,'\nI said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.\" Odette\nnarrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it\nappeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was\nthereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed.\nBut, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:\n\n\"You are a fiend!\" she flung at him, \"you enjoy tormenting me, making me\ntell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.\"\n\nThis second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the\nfirst. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden\nfrom his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past\nwhich he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered,\nwhich he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself\nto have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now\nassumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty.\nIn the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on\nthe Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette\nhad the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the\nlittle scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for\nbreath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the \"rock there,\"... He\ncould hear her answer--alas, how lightheartedly--\"I've heard that tale\nbefore!\" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that\nno further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent\nfor a time, then said to her:\n\n\"My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you\ndreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.\"\n\nBut she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not\nknow, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his\nmemory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the\nnews of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he\nwas dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired\nthe habit of finding life interesting--of marvelling at the strange\ndiscoveries that there were to be made in it--that even while he was\nsuffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such\nagony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: \"Life is indeed\nastonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far\nmore common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom\nI had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any\ncase, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal\nand healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable\naccusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far\nmore than I could ever have suspected.\" But he could not confine himself\nto these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of\nthe importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he\nmight conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to\ndo them again. He repeated her words to himself: \"I knew quite well what\nshe was after.\" \"Two or three times.\" \"I've heard that tale before.\" But\nthey did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife\nwith which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man\nwho cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the\nmovement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself:\n\"I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,\" \"I've heard that tale before,\"\nbut the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed\nto find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly,\nhad dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to\nhim as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number\nof women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to\nexpect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to\nremain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always\nguided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile:\n\"You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!\"\nBy what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the\nold days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures)\nbeen precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not\nsee how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She\nwas but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother\nwho had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice,\nto a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained\nfor him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's _Journal d'un Po�te_ which\nhe had previously read without emotion: \"When one feels oneself smitten\nby love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her\nsurroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies\nin the answer.\" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt\nover in his mind as, \"I've heard that tale before,\" or \"I knew quite\nwell what she was after,\" could cause him so much pain. But he realised\nthat what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the\npanoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt\nwhile Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he\nnow was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,--indeed, it\nwas no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether\nforgiven the offence--whenever he repeated her words his old anguish\nrefashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant,\ntrustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might\nbe effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man\nwho does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story\nwould still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled\nat the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the\nweakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age\ncreeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments.\nBut, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make\nSwann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one\nof those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a\nnew sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with\nundiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with\nthe Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than\nthe centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it,\noverflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever\npoint in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that\nseason, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the\nIsland in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by\nslow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him\nwas neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be\ninflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all\nthe period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him,\na period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind,\nwas not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had\nconsisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete\nincidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past,\nnow colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an\nobscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued\nto refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from\nlaziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day,\nhe might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des\nLaumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain;\nmeanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him\nwith fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of\ndifferent events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed,\nwould make it break out again in another form.\n\nBut, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded,\nnow, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without\nthought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her\nvices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life\nwhich Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead,\nwas far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same\nair of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any\nsuspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which\nhe may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being\nimperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal\nways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind,\nwith the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann,\nher other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected\nby these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them,\nwithout their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself\nin which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was\noverwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed.\nOne day, he was trying--without hurting Odette--to discover from her\nwhether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a\nmatter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had\nput the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been\nreceived there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained\nthere, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden--a dead weight, but\nnone the less disturbing--of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now\nextirpate it for ever.\n\n\"Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,\"\nher smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it\nwas impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. \"There was one of them\nwaited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any\nmoney I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll\nkill myself if you don't bring her to me'--meaning me! They told her I'd\ngone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself\nand speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen\nthe way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told\nme I shouted fit to bring the house down:--'But when you hear me say\nthat I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all!\nI should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and\nwhere I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter\nhas orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of\ntown. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room\nwhile I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear.\nThere's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though\npeople do say such dreadful things about her.\"\n\nBesides, her very admissions--when she made any--of faults which she\nsupposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point\nfor fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions\nnever exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate\nher confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the\naccessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed\nhim anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his\njealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried\nthem along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like\ncorpses in a river. And they poisoned it.\n\nShe spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the\nday of the Paris-Murcie F�te. \"What! you knew him as long ago as that?\nOh, yes, of course you did,\" he corrected himself, so as not to shew\nthat he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble\nat the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie F�te, when he had\nreceived that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been\nhaving luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore\nthat she had not. \"Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or\nother which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,\" he pursued, hoping to\nfrighten her. \"Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I\ntold you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me\nat Pr�vost's,\" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a\nfirmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a\nfear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to\nconceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if\nshe chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a\nheadsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty,\nsince she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh,\nthough this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from\nthinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. \"It's quite true, I\nhadn't been to the Maison Dor�e. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I\nhad, really, been to Pr�vost's--that wasn't a story--and he met me there\nand asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came\nto see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I\nwas afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really,\ndon't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all\nabout it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight,\nthat I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie F�te, if it were\ntrue? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so\nwell as we do now, did we, dear?\"\n\nHe smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly\nspiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so,\neven in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because\nthey had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was\nalready lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which\nthey had \"done a cattleya\") when she had told him that she was coming\nfrom the Maison Dor�e, how many others must there have been, each\nof them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He\nrecalled how she had said to him once: \"I need only tell Mme. Verdurin\nthat my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always\nsome excuse.\" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly\nuttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the\nhour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his\nhaving the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had\nhad with some other man, some man to whom she had said: \"I need only\ntell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There\nis always some excuse.\" And beneath all his most pleasant memories,\nbeneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those\nold days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of\na Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him,\nbeneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du\nBois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that\ntemporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day\nhas been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding\nplace for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of\na possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that\nhad remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La P�rouse\nitself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours\nthan those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror\nthat had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to\nthe Maison Dor�e, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of\nNineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past....\nIf, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of\nthe Maison Dor�e it was because that name recalled to him, no longer,\nas, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good\nfortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now\nfirst aware. Then it befell the Maison Dor�e, as it had befallen the\nIsland in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him.\nFor what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them,\nsingle, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an\ninfinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is\nephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the\nimpression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's\nlove, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of\ninfidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which\nhad Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time\nwithout seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by\nothers. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart\nalternate seeds of love and suspicion.\n\nOn certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of\nwhich she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage,\nunder penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must\ninstantly accompany her home, to \"do a cattleya,\" and the desire\nwhich she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so\nimperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative\nand so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann\njust as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had\nthus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was\ninterspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to\nher habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he\nrose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage\nto return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering\nrage, broke a vase, with \"I never can do anything right with you,\nyou impossible person!\" And he was left uncertain whether she had not\nactually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had\nwished to wound, or else to inflame his senses.\n\nSometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about\nOdette, although he dared not mention her name. \"I have a little thing\nhere, you're sure to like,\" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he\nwould stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who\nsat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still\nquite young and attractive, said to him once, \"Of course, what I should\nlike would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain,\nI should never go with any other men again.\" \"Indeed, do you think it\npossible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with\nher, and never to be unfaithful to him?\" asked Swann anxiously. \"Why,\nsurely! It all depends on their characters!\" Swann could not help making\nthe same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse\ndes Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a\nsmile: \"But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with\nyour sash.\" \"And you too, you've got blue cuffs on.\" \"What a charming\nconversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring\nyou, am I; or keeping you?\" \"No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you\nbored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk.\" \"I am highly\nflattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?\" he asked the 'manageress,'\nwho had just looked in. \"Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to\nmyself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come\nto my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other\nday, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems\nthat, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal,\nI call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,\"\nshe ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue\neyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to\ninterest him. She did not know Odette.\n\nThe painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage;\nseveral of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could\nnot face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all\nhired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going\non a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann\nwould feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as\nthough this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance\nbetween them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he\ncould not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as\neveryone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series\nof temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything\nbeforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the\n'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to\nTunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been\nabsent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost\nhappy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and\nDr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them,\nand that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return\nto Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken\nout, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And\nthe painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of\nthese four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled\n'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and\nhad found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round\nof visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a\nplume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a\nparasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves\nfresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would,\nin fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same\nneighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would\nmake use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or\ntwo, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched\nsurface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether\nshe ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite\nnaturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which,\nevery now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the\nomnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would\nrepeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she\nclambered in the course of an afternoon.\n\n\"I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as\nyourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that\nthe whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it?\nWhose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the\nsame in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but\nMachard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you\naren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait.\"\n\nSwann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard\nwas afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to\nconfess the omission.\n\n\"Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite\nfrank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you\nhaven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well\nnow, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people\nwho find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think\nit's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow\nladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell\nyou, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I\nalways say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can\nquite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh,\ndear me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does,\nbut even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard!\nJust listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see\nat this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your\ncompany), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he\nis one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her\nportrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another\nfriend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched\nPhilistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of\npainting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important\nthing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand\nfrancs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know\nwhat I mean.\"\n\nHaving exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the\nloftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number\ninked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of\nspeaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they\nhad still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the\nRue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the\npromptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.\n\n\"Your ears must have been burning,\" she ventured, \"while we were on the\nyacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.\"\n\nSwann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never\nuttered in the Verdurins' presence.\n\n\"You see,\" Mme. Cottard went on, \"Mme. de Cr�cy was there; need I say\nmore? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking\nabout you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says.\nWhat! you don't believe me!\" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked\nsceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without\nputting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the\nsense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a\npair of friends: \"Why, she _adores_ you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would\nnever do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon\nbe taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at\na picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's\nthe man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one\nlike him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can\nhe be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too\ndreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.'\n(Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking\nof us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression\nwhich I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in\nthe world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?'\nAnd Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'\n\n\"No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a\ntrue friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you,\nbesides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme.\nVerdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks\nmore freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette\nisn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very\nlittle beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor\nstopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have\ngone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so\nvery kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?\"\n\nAnd Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a\nwhite-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an\natmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with\nthe harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself\noverflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and\nalmost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was\nno longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now,\nas love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with\nloving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte,\nher plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she\nclasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be\nseen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went.\n\nTo compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had\nfor Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever\nher husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal,\nfeelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make\nOdette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women\ncould inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final\ntransformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed\naffection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the\npainter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom\nSwann had calculated that he might live in happiness.\n\nIn former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come\nwhen he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to\nkeep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to\nescape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the\nfaintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in\nhis desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say\nbecome another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the\nself which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught\nhis eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been\nOdette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and,\ninasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from\nthat period in which he had so keenly suffered--though in it he had also\nknown a way of feeling so intensely happy--and that the accidents of his\ncourse might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily\nand at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything,\nan agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice\nbehind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that\nItaly and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this\nparticular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made\nan effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he\nmight, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was\ntoo late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be\na landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had\ndeparted, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete\nduality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling\nwhich one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering\nin his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would\ntake the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that\nhe would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough\nlater on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity,\nwith as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over\nhis eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing\nhim, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has\nlived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip\naway from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed,\nlike the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the\nfrontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close\nat hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's\nlover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now\nutterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the\nmoment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before\nkissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his\nmemory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was\naltered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have\nwished--in thought at least--to have been in a position to bid farewell,\nwhile she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and\njealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now\nhe would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see\nher once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the\ntwilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard,\na young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette,\nNapoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line\nof the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few\nfeet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the\nparty who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those\nwho were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing,\nand it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them.\nNow and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on\nhis cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off,\nbut he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well\nas because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness,\nthis might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished\ngaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change\nits shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy\nmoustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with\nlittle fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she\nlooked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach\nthemselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he\nloved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him\nat once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch,\nand said: \"I must go.\" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal\nmanner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were\nto meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked\nto follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction,\nto answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was\nfrantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly\nhave crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly,\nhave torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb\nwith Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from\nOdette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second\npassed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter\nremarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately\nafter Odette. \"They had obviously arranged it between them,\" he added;\n\"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they\nwouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his\nmistress.\" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to\nconsole him. \"After all, she is quite right,\" he said to the young man,\ndrying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more\nat ease. \"I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be\nso distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.\" So Swann\nreasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at\nfirst, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had\ndistributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the\n'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped\nwith a fez.\n\nAs for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association\nof ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy,\nand lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast,\nhad made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the\nperson who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was\nindeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images,\nSwann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time,\nsuch creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple\nact of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he\nfelt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he\nthought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of\nwhich he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes\nwhich, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite\npoints in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to\nstartle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum\nrang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses;\nhe could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own\nheart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast.\nSuddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a\nnausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at\nhim as he passed: \"Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night\nwith her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him\neverything. It was they that started the fire.\" It was his valet, come\nto awaken him, and saying:--\n\n\"Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to\ncall again in an hour.\"\n\nBut these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which\nSwann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing\nthat refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of\nwater, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of\nthe door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the\nclangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile\nthe scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes,\nheard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very\ndistant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the\nsting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose,\nand dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had\nwritten, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going,\nthat afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer--Mlle.\nLegrandin that had been--was spending a few days there. The association\nin his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country\nwhich he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction\nwhich had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the\ndifferent changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain\nother people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we\nare in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before\nlove has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest\nappearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us\npleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as\nan indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann\nhad often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in\nthe theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever\nseeing her again--and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de\nSaint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to\nMme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is\nnot uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness\nwhich does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations\nof a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might\nhave occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who,\nindeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening,\nsomewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to\nhim, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what\ndid seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place,\nand he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact\nthat he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that\nevening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention\nthat life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any\nlength of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be\nwished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he\nhad passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected,\nwhich were already being brought to birth,--the exact balance between\nwhich was too difficult to establish--were linked by a sort of\nconcatenation of necessity.\n\nBut while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions\nto the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become\ndisarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he\nsaw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid\ncomplexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all\nthe things which--in the course of those successive bursts of affection\nwhich had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the\nfirst impression that he had formed of her--he had ceased to observe\nafter the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless,\nwhile he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of\nthose things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared\nin him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time,\nthe average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: \"To think\nthat I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that\nthe greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did\nnot please me, who was not in my style!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLACE-NAMES: THE NAME\n\nAmong the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during\nmy long nights of sleeplessness, there was none that differed more\nutterly from the rooms at Combray, thickly powdered with the motes of an\natmosphere granular, pollenous, edible and instinct with piety, than\nmy room in the Grand H�tel de la Plage, at Balbec, the walls of which,\nwashed with ripolin, contained, like the polished sides of a basin in\nwhich the water glows with a blue, lurking fire, a finer air, pure,\nazure-tinted, saline. The Bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted\nwith the furnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration\nin different rooms, and in that which I found myself occupying had set\nagainst the walls, on three sides of it, a series of low book-cases\nwith glass fronts, in which, according to where they stood, by a law\nof nature which he had, perhaps, forgotten to take into account, was\nreflected this or that section of the ever-changing view of the sea, so\nthat the walls were lined with a frieze of seascapes, interrupted only\nby the polished mahogany of the actual shelves. And so effective was\nthis that the whole room had the appearance of one of those model\nbedrooms which you see nowadays in Housing Exhibitions, decorated with\nworks of art which are calculated by their designer to refresh the eyes\nof whoever may ultimately have to sleep in the rooms, the subjects being\nkept in some degree of harmony with the locality and surroundings of the\nhouses for which the rooms are planned.\n\nAnd yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real\nBalbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy\ndays, when the wind was so strong that Fran�oise, as she took me to\nthe Champs-Elys�es, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the\nstreet, or I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and\nwould recount to me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and\nshipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing\nmore than to behold a storm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as\na momentary revelation of the true life of nature; or rather there\nwere for me no mighty spectacles save those which I knew to be\nnot artificially composed for my entertainment, but necessary and\nunalterable,--the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art. I was\nnot curious, I did not thirst to know anything save what I believed\nto be more genuine than myself, what had for me the supreme merit of\nshewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius, or of the force\nor the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself,\nwithout human interference. Just as the lovely sound of her voice,\nreproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never console a\nman for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a storm\nwould have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the\nExhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine,\nthat the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an\nembankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by\nall the feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite\nthing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind The less she\nbore their imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my\nheart. And, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which\nLegrandin had cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst\nof \"that funereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed,\nfor six months in the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the\nwaves.\n\n\"You feel, there, below your feet still,\" he had told me, \"far more even\nthan at Finist�re (and even though hotels are now being superimposed\nupon it, without power, however, to modify that oldest bone in the\nearth's skeleton) you feel there that you are actually at the land's\nend of France, of Europe, of the Old World. And it is the ultimate\nencampment of the fishermen, precisely like the fishermen who have\nlived since the world's beginning, facing the everlasting kingdom of\nthe sea-fogs and shadows of the night.\" One day when, at Combray, I had\nspoken of this coast, this Balbec, before M. Swann, hoping to learn from\nhim whether it was the best point to select for seeing the most violent\nstorms, he had replied: \"I should think I did know Balbec! The church\nat Balbec, built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and still\nhalf romanesque, is perhaps the most curious example to be found of our\nNorman gothic, and so exceptional that one is tempted to describe it\nas Persian in its inspiration.\" And that region, which, until then, had\nseemed to me to be nothing else than a part of immemorial nature, that\nhad remained contemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology--and as\nremote from human history as the Ocean itself, or the Great Bear, with\nits wild race of fishermen for whom, no more than for their whales,\nhad there been any Middle Ages--it had been a great joy to me to see\nit suddenly take its place in the order of the centuries, with a stored\nconsciousness of the romanesque epoch, and to know that the gothic\ntrefoil had come to diversify those wild rocks also, at the appointed\nhour, like those frail but hardy plants which, in the Polar regions,\nwhen the spring returns, scatter their stars about the eternal snows.\nAnd if gothic art brought to those places and people a classification\nwhich, otherwise, they lacked, they too conferred one upon it in return.\nI tried to form a picture in my mind of how those fishermen had lived,\nthe timid and unsuspected essay towards social intercourse which they\nhad attempted there, clustered upon a promontory of the shores of Hell,\nat the foot of the cliffs of death; and gothic art seemed to me a more\nliving thing now that, detaching it from the towns in which, until then,\nI had always imagined it, I could see how, in a particular instance,\nupon a reef of savage rocks, it had taken root and grown until it\nflowered in a tapering spire. I was taken to see reproductions of the\nmost famous of the statues at Balbec,--shaggy, blunt-faced Apostles,\nthe Virgin from the porch,--and I could scarcely breathe for joy at the\nthought that I might myself, one day, see them take a solid form against\ntheir eternal background of salt fog. Thereafter, on dear, tempestuous\nFebruary nights, the wind--breathing into my heart, which it shook no\nless violently than the chimney of my bedroom, the project of a visit to\nBalbec--blended in me the desire for gothic architecture with that for a\nstorm upon the sea.\n\nI should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the generous\ntrain at one twenty-two, of which never without a palpitating heart\ncould I read, in the railway company's bills or in advertisements of\ncircular tours, the hour of departure: it seemed to me to cut, at\na precise point in every afternoon, a most fascinating groove, a\nmysterious mark, from which the diverted hours still led one on, of\ncourse, towards evening, towards to-morrow morning, but to an evening\nand morning which one would behold, not in Paris but in one of those\ntowns through which the train passed and among which it allowed one\nto choose; for it stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitr�, at\nQuestambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at\nBenodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and progressed magnificently\nsurcharged with names which it offered me, so that, among them all, I\ndid not know which to choose, so impossible was it to sacrifice any.\nBut even without waiting for the train next day, I could, by rising and\ndressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very evening, should\nmy parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread westward over the\nraging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek shelter in that church\nin the Persian manner. But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when\nmy parents had promised to let me spend them, for once, in the North\nof Italy, lo! in place of those dreams of tempests, by which I had been\nentirely possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in\nfrom all sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts,\nbeside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers\nthe sea-birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away\nall their charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could\nonly have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream\nof the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still\npricking with all the needle-points of the winter's frost, but that\nwhich already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole,\nand gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those in Fra\nAngelico's pictures. From that moment, only sunlight, perfumes, colours,\nseemed to me to have any value; for this alternation of images had\neffected a change of front in my desire, and--as abrupt as those that\noccur sometimes in music,--a complete change of tone in my sensibility.\nThus it came about that a mere atmospheric variation would be sufficient\nto provoke in me that modulation, without there being any need for me to\nawait the return of a season. For often we find a day, in one, that has\nstrayed from another season, and makes us live in that other, summons at\nonce into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and\ninterrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving, by inserting,\nout of its turn, too early or too late, this leaf, torn from another\nchapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon it happened\nthat, like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health\ncan derive but an accidental and all too modest benefit, until the day\nwhen science takes control of them, and, producing them at will, places\nin our hands the power to order their appearance, withdrawn from\nthe tutelage and independent of the consent of chance; similarly the\nproduction of these dreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend\nentirely upon the changes of the seasons and of the weather. I need\nonly, to make them reappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice,\nFlorence, within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the\nlonging inspired in me by the places for which they stood. Even in\nspring, to come in a book upon the name of Balbec sufficed to awaken\nin me the desire for storms at sea and for the Norman gothic; even on a\nstormy day the name of Florence or of Venice would awaken the desire for\nsunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and for Santa Maria\ndel Fiore.\n\nBut if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that I had formed\nof these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subordinating\nits reappearance in me to their own special laws; and in consequence of\nthis they made it more beautiful, but at the same time more different\nfrom anything that the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could in reality be,\nand, by increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination, aggravated\nthe disenchantment that was in store for me when I set out upon my\ntravels. They magnified the idea that I formed of certain points on the\nearth's surface, making them more special, and in consequence more\nreal. I did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic\nbuildings, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there\nof a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them\nas on an unknown thing, different from all the rest, a thing for which\nmy soul was athirst, by the knowledge of which it would benefit. How\nmuch more individual still was the character that they assumed from\nbeing designated by names, names that were only for themselves, proper\nnames such as people have. Words present to us little pictures of\nthings, lucid and normal, like the pictures that are hung on the walls\nof schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by\na carpenter's bench, a bird, an ant-hill; things chosen as typical of\neverything else of the same sort. But names present to us--of persons\nand of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual, as unique,\nlike persons--a confused picture, which draws from the names, from\nthe brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in which it is\nuniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely\nred, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the process used\nin their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer's part, are blue or\nred not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church and the\npeople in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I most\nlonged to visit, after reading the _Chartreuse_, seeming to me compact\nand glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such or\nsuch a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me the\npleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact\nand glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses\nin any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid\nof that heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air\nstirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness\nand the reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was\nof a town miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called\nthe City of the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As\nfor Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of\nNorman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which\nit was fashioned, one sees depicted still the representation of some\nlong-abolished custom, of some feudal right, of the former condition of\nsome place, of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language, which had\nshaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which I never doubted\nthat I should find spoken there at once, even by the inn-keeper who\nwould pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch\nthe turbulent sea, unchained, before the church; to whom I lent the\naspect, disputatious, solemn and mediaeval, of some character in one of\nthe old romances.\n\nHad my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if not\nactually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just once, so\nas to become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy\nor of Brittany, that one twenty-two train into which I had so often\nclambered in imagination, I should have preferred to stop, and to alight\nfrom it, at the most beautiful of its towns; but in vain might I\ncompare and contrast them; how was one to choose, any more than between\nindividual people, who are not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty\nin its noble coronet of rusty lace, whose highest point caught the light\nof the old gold of its second syllable; Vitr�, whose acute accent barred\nits ancient glass with wooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness\nranged from egg-shell yellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman\nCathedral, which its final consonants, rich and yellowing, crowned with\na tower of butter; Lannion with the rumble and buzz, in the silence of\nits village street, of the fly on the wheel of the coach; Questambert,\nPontorson, ridiculously silly and simple, white feathers and yellow\nbeaks strewn along the road to those well-watered and poetic spots;\nBenodet, a name scarcely moored that seemed to be striving to draw the\nriver down into the tangle of its seaweeds; Pont-Aven, the snowy, rosy\nflight of the wing of a lightly poised coif, tremulously reflected in\nthe greenish waters of a canal; Quimperl�, more firmly attached, this,\nand since the Middle Ages, among the rivulets with which it babbled,\nthreading their pearls upon a grey background, like the pattern made,\nthrough the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight changed into\nblunt points of tarnished silver?\n\nThese images were false for another reason also; namely, that they\nwere necessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my\nimagination aspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and\nwithout any immediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody\nof names; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams,\nthose names now magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very\ncomprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them\ntwo or three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would\nlie there side by side, without interval or partition; in the name of\nBalbec, as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which\none buys at sea-side places, I could distinguish waves surging round\na church built in the Persian manner. Perhaps, indeed, the enforced\nsimplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they\nhad over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we should go\nfor the Easter holidays to Florence and Venice, not finding room\nto introduce into the name of Florence the elements that ordinarily\nconstitute a town, I was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from\nthe impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what I supposed to be,\nin its essentials, the genius of Giotto. All the more--and because one\ncannot make a name extend much further in time than in space--like some\nof Giotto's paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments\nthe same person engaged in different actions, here lying on his bed,\nthere just about to mount his horse, the name of Florence was divided\ninto two compartments. In one, beneath an architectural dais, I gazed\nupon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight,\ndusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since\nI thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and\nenveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the life not yet\nlived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them, gave to the\nmost material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same attraction\nthat they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved swiftly--so as\nto arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was spread for me,\nwith fruit and a flask of Chianti--across a Ponte Vecchio heaped with\njonquils, narcissi and anemones. That (for all that I was still in\nParis) was what I saw, and not what was actually round about me. Even\nfrom the simplest, the most realistic point of view, the countries for\nwhich we long occupy, at any given moment, a far larger place in our\ntrue life than the country in which we may happen to be. Doubtless, if,\nat that time, I had paid more attention to what was in my mind when I\npronounced the words \"going to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice,\"\nI should have realised that what I saw was in no sense a town, but\nsomething as different from anything that I knew, something as delicious\nas might be for a human race whose whole existence had passed in a\nseries of late winter afternoons, that inconceivable marvel, a morning\nin spring. These images, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling all my\nnights and days, differentiated this period in my life from those which\nhad gone before it (and might easily have been confused with it by\nan observer who saw things only from without, that is to say, who saw\nnothing), as in an opera a fresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere\nwhich one could never have suspected if one had done no more than\nread the libretto, still less if one had remained outside the theatre,\ncounting only the minutes as they passed. And besides, even from the\npoint of view of mere quantity, in our life the days are not all equal.\nTo reach the end of a day, natures that are slightly nervous, as\nmine was, make use, like motor-cars, of different 'speeds.' There are\nmountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an infinite time to\npass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go at full tilt,\nsinging as one goes. During this month--in which I went laboriously\nover, as over a tune, though never to my satisfaction, these visions of\nFlorence, Venice, Pisa, from which the desire that they excited in me\ndrew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been\nlove, love for another person--I never ceased to believe that they\ncorresponded to a reality independent of myself, and they made me\nconscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a\nChristian in the primitive age of faith, on the eve of his entry into\nParadise. Moreover, without my paying any heed to the contradiction that\nthere was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense\nwhat had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by\nmy senses at all--though all the more tempting to them, in consequence,\nmore different from anything that they knew--it was that which recalled\nto me the reality of these visions, which inflamed my desire all the\nmore by seeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied.\nAnd for all that the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for\naesthetic enjoyments, the guide-books ministered even more to it than\nbooks on aesthetics, and, more again than the guide-books, the railway\ntime-tables. What moved me was the thought that this Florence which I\ncould see, so near and yet inaccessible, in my imagination, if the tract\nwhich separated it from me, in myself, was not one that I might cross,\ncould yet be reached by a circuit, by a digression, were I to take\nthe plain, terrestrial path. When I repeated to myself, giving thus a\nspecial value to what I was going to see, that Venice was the \"School of\nGiorgione, the home of Titian, the most complete museum of the domestic\narchitecture of the Middle Ages,\" I felt happy indeed. As I was even\nmore when, on one of my walks, as I stepped out briskly on account\nof the weather, which, after several days of a precocious spring, had\nrelapsed into winter (like the weather that we had invariably found\nawaiting us at Combray, in Holy Week),--seeing upon the boulevards that\nthe chestnut-trees, though plunged in a glacial atmosphere that soaked\nthrough them like a stream of water, were none the less beginning,\npunctual guests, arrayed already for the party, and admitting no\ndiscouragement, to shape and chisel and curve in its frozen lumps the\nirrepressible verdure whose steady growth the abortive power of the\ncold might hinder but could not succeed in restraining--I reflected that\nalready the Ponte Vecchio was heaped high with an abundance of hyacinths\nand anemones, and that the spring sunshine was already tinging the waves\nof the Grand Canal with so dusky an azure, with emeralds so splendid\nthat when they washed and were broken against the foot of one of\nTitian's paintings they could vie with it in the richness of their\ncolouring. I could no longer contain my joy when my father, in the\nintervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the cold, began\nto look out which were the best trains, and when I understood that by\nmaking one's way, after luncheon, into the coal-grimed laboratory, the\nwizard's cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of its\nsurroundings, one could awaken, next morning, in the city of marble\nand gold, in which \"the building of the wall was of jasper and the\nfoundation of the wall an emerald.\" So that it and the City of the\nLilies were not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my\npleasure in front of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain\ndistance from Paris which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to\nsee them, at their appointed place on the earth's surface, and at no\nother; in a word they were entirely real. They became even more real\nto me when my father, by saying: \"Well, you can stay in Venice from the\n20th to the 29th, and reach Florence on Easter morning,\" made them both\nemerge, no longer only from the abstraction of Space, but from that\nimaginary Time in which we place not one, merely, but several of\nour travels at once, which do not greatly tax us since they are but\npossibilities,--that Time which reconstructs itself so effectively that\none can spend it again in one town after one has already spent it in\nanother--and consecrated to them some of those actual, calendar days\nwhich are certificates of the genuineness of what one does on them, for\nthose unique days are consumed by being used, they do not return, one\ncannot live them again here when one has lived them elsewhere; I felt\nthat it was towards the week that would begin with the Monday on which\nthe laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that I had stained\nwith ink, that they were hastening to busy themselves with the duty\nof emerging from that ideal Time in which they did not, as yet, exist,\nthose two Queen Cities of which I was soon to be able, by the most\nabsorbing kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on a\npage of my own life. But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme\npinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the\nrevelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the\nlight reflected from Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite\nso many promptings, continued to imagine, the men \"majestic and terrible\nas the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds\nof their blood-red cloaks,\" who would be walking in Venice next week, on\nthe Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom,\nin an enlarged photograph of St. Mark's that had been lent to me, the\noperator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when\nI heard my father say: \"It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand\nCanal; whatever you do, don't forget to pack your winter greatcoat and\nyour thick suit.\" At these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy;\na thing that I had until then deemed impossible, I felt myself to be\npenetrating indeed between those \"rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the\nIndian Ocean\"; by a supreme muscular effort, a long way in excess of my\nreal strength, stripping myself, as of a shell that served no purpose,\nof the air in my own room which surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal\nquantity of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere, indescribable and\npeculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had\nsecreted in the name of Venice; I could feel at work within me a\nmiraculous disincarnation; it was at once accompanied by that vague\ndesire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat; and\nthey had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor\nnot only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to Florence and\nVenice was absolutely out of the question, but warned their that, even\nwhen I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a year,\ngive up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that was\nliable to excite me.\n\nAnd, alas, he forbade also, most categorically, my being allowed to go\nto the theatre, to hear Berma; the sublime artist, whose genius Bergotte\nhad proclaimed, might, by introducing me to something else that was,\nperhaps, as important and as beautiful, have consoled me for not having\nbeen to Florence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. My parents had\nto be content with sending me, every day, to the Champs-Elys�es, in\nthe custody of a person who would see that I did not tire myself; this\nperson was none other than Fran�oise, who had entered our service\nafter the death of my aunt L�onie. Going to the Champs-Elys�es I found\nunendurable. If only Bergotte had described the place in one of his\nbooks, I should, no doubt, have longed to see and to know it, like so\nmany things else of which a simulacrum had first found its way into\nmy imagination. That kept things warm, made them live, gave them\npersonality, and I sought then to find their counterpart in reality,\nbut in this public garden there was nothing that attached itself to my\ndreams.\n\n* * *\n\nOne day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses,\nFran�oise had taken me for an excursion--across the frontier guarded at\nregular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women--into\nthose neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the\npassers-by were strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had\ngone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to\na shrubbery of laurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad\nlawn, of meagre close-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated,\nat its far end, by a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a\nlittle girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from\nthe path, another little girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering\nup her battledore, called out sharply: \"Good-bye, Gilberte, I'm going\nhome now; don't forget, we're coming to you this evening, after dinner.\"\nThe name Gilberte passed close by me, evoking all the more forcibly her\nwhom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her, as one speaks\nof a man in his absence, but was directly addressed to her; it passed\nthus close by me, in action, so to speak, with a force that\nincreased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to\nits target;--carrying in its wake, I could feel, the knowledge, the\nimpression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged not to me but\nto the friend who called to her, everything that, while she uttered the\nwords, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her memory, of\ntheir daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each other, of\nthat unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all the more\npainful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable to this\nhappy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able to\npenetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted cry:\nletting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that message\nhad distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain invisible\npoints in Mlle. Swann's life, from the evening to come, as it would be,\nafter dinner, at her home,--forming, on its celestial passage through\nthe midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud,\nexquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin's\ngardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with\nchariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting,\nfinally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a\nscrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player,\nwho continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess,\nwith a blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little\nband of light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a\ncarpet on which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering\nfeet, nostalgic and profane, while Fran�oise shouted: \"Come on, button\nup your coat, look, and let's get away!\" and I remarked for the first\ntime how common her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather\nin her hat.\n\nOnly, would _she_ come again to the Champs-Elys�es? Next day she was\nnot there; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time\nrevolving round the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such\neffect that once, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a\nprisoner's base, she sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete\ntheir side, and from that day I played with her whenever she came.\nBut this did not happen every day; there were days when she had\nbeen prevented from coming by her lessons, by her catechism, by a\nluncheon-party, by the whole of that life, separated from my own, which\ntwice only, condensed into the name of Gilberte, I had felt pass so\npainfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane near Combray and on the\ngrass of the Champs-Elys�es. On such days she would have told us\nbeforehand that we should not see her; if it were because of her\nlessons, she would say: \"It is too tiresome, I sha'n't be able to come\nto-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me,\" with an\nair of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the other hand,\nshe had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this, asked her\nwhether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: \"Indeed I hope\nnot! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend's.\" But on these\ndays I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on others,\nwithout any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or some such\nthing, and next day she would say: \"Oh, yes! I went out with Mamma,\"\nas though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not the\ngreatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the days\nof bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of\nthe rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elys�es.\n\nAnd so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not\ncease to interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady\nopposite, just inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to\nmyself: \"That lady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which\none can go out. Why should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?\" But\nthe day grew dark. My mother said that it might clear again, that one\nburst of sunshine would be enough, but that more probably it would rain;\nand if it rained, of what use would it be to go to the Champs-Elys�es?\nAnd so, from breakfast-time, my anxious eyes never left the uncertain,\nclouded sky. It remained dark: Outside the window, the balcony was grey.\nSuddenly, on its sullen stone, I did not indeed see a less negative\ncolour, but I felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour,\nthe pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light.\nA moment later the balcony was as pale and luminous as a standing water\nat dawn, and a thousand shadows from the iron-work of its balustrade had\ncome to rest on it. A breath of wind dispersed them; the stone grew\ndark again, but, like tamed creatures, they returned; they began,\nimperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those continuous\ncrescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry a single\nnote to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through all the\nintermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable gold of\nfine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of the\nbalustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a\nfineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to\nindicate a deliberate application, an artist's satisfaction, and with so\nmuch relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre\nand happy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay\nreflected on that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges\nof happiness and peace of mind.\n\nBrief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the\nmost depressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate\nwindows; to me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared\nupon our balcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte,\nwho was perhaps already in the Champs-Elys�es, and as soon as I arrived\nthere would greet me with: \"Let's begin at once. You are on my side.\"\nFrail, swept away by a breath, but at the same time in harmony, not with\nthe season, with the hour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which\nthe day will deny or fulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate\npleasure, the pleasure of loving and of being loved; more soft,\nmore warm upon the stone than even moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine\nsufficing for its birth, and for the birth of joy, even in the heart of\nwinter.\n\nAnd on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the\nfine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees\nwere hidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but\nwhen the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte\nwould venture out, then suddenly--inspiring my mother to say: \"Look,\nit's quite fine now; I think you might perhaps try going to the\nChamps-Elys�es after all.\"--On the mantle of snow that swathed the\nbalcony, the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold, with\nembroidered patches of dark shadow. That day we found no one there, or\nelse a solitary girl, on the point of departure, who assured me that\nGilberte was not coming. The chairs, deserted by the imposing but\nuninspiring company of governesses, stood empty. Only, near the grass,\nwas sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers, dressed\nalways in an identical style, splendid and sombre, to make whose\nacquaintance I would have, at that period, sacrificed, had it lain in my\npower, all the greatest opportunities in my life to come. For Gilberte\nwent up every day to speak to her; she used to ask Gilberte for news of\nher \"dearest mother\" and it struck me that, if I had known her, I should\nhave been for Gilberte some one wholly different, some one who knew\npeople in her parents' world. While her grandchildren played together at\na little distance, she would sit and read the D�bats, which she called\n\"My old _D�bats_!\" as, with an aristocratic familiarity, she would say,\nspeaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the chairs, \"My\nold friend the police-sergeant,\" or \"The chair-keeper and I, who are old\nfriends.\"\n\nFran�oise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont\nde la Concorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even\nchildren, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded,\ndefenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elys�es;\nI was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and\nthe white lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had\nbeen cleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a\nlong pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady\nherself, having folded up her _D�bats_, asked a passing nursemaid\nthe time, thanking her with \"How very good of you!\" then begged the\nroad-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding\n\"A thousand thanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!\" Suddenly\nthe sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses,\nagainst the opening horizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign,\nMademoiselle's blue feather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed\ntowards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened\nby the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before\nshe reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her\nbalance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending\nthat she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly\nadvanced, as though to embrace me. \"Bravo! bravo! that's splendid;\n'topping,' I should say, like you--'sporting,' I suppose I ought to say,\nonly I'm a hundred-and-one, a woman of the old school,\" exclaimed the\nlady, uttering, on behalf of the voiceless Champs-Elys�es, their thanks\nto Gilberte for having come, without letting herself be frightened\naway by the weather. \"You are like me, faithful at all costs to our old\nChamps-Elys�es; we are two brave souls! You wouldn't believe me, I dare\nsay, if I told you that I love them, even like this. This snow (I know,\nyou'll laugh at me), it makes me think of ermine!\" And the old lady\nbegan to laugh herself.\n\nThe first of these days--to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that\nwere able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness\nof a day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because\nit changed the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary\nscene of our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in\ndust-sheets--that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of\nmy love, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share\nwith me. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to\nbe thus alone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but\nalso on her part--as though she had come there solely to please me, and\nin such weather--it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days\non which she had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order\nto come to me in the Champs-Elys�es; I acquired more confidence in the\nvitality, in the future of a friendship which could remain so much alive\namid the torpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while\nshe dropped pellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what\nseemed to me at once a predilection that she shewed for me in thus\ntolerating me as her travelling companion in this new, this wintry land,\nand a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times.\nPresently, one after another, like shyly bopping sparrows, her friends\narrived, black against the snow. We got ready to play and, since this\nday which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up,\nbefore the game started, to the friend with the sharp voice whom I had\nheard, that first day, calling Gilberte by name, she said to me: \"No,\nno, I'm sure you'd much rather be in Gilberte's camp; besides, look,\nshe's signalling to you.\" She was in fact summoning me to cross the\nsnowy lawn to her camp, to 'take the field,' which the sun, by casting\nover it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had\nturned into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.\n\nThis day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it\nhappened, one of the few on which I was not unduly wretched.\n\nFor, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a\nsingle day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my\ngrandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the\ninstinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street\nand killed, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the\nChamps-Elys�es; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone),\nyet those moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited\nwith so much impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered\nwith excitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the\nworld, were by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they\nwere the only moments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous,\nundistracted attention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom\nof pleasure. All the time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see\nher, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her,\nI was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my\nlove corresponded. Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me.\nFar from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom\nshe preferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was\nalways willing to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive\nenough to the game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent\ncoldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her\na creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a\nlove that Gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon\nthe love that I felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the\nassaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which\nI was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my\nfeelings with regard to her I had never yet ventured to express to her\nin words. Of course, on every page of my exercise-books, I wrote out,\nin endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those\nvague lines which I might trace, without her having to think, on that\naccount, of me, I felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of\nGilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire,\nwhich they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely\npersonal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. The most important thing\nwas that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and should have an\nopportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then,\nwould not officially (so to speak) have begun. Doubtless the various\nreasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less\nurgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in\nthe culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which\nwe derive from thinking of a woman, as I was thinking of Gilberte,\nwithout troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds\nto the reality,--and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to\nbe sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure\nof confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the\npassion that she has for us, like those Japanese gardeners who, to\nobtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. But at the period\nwhen I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really\nexist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount\nthe obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in\nwhich we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me\nthat if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of\na confession a pretence of indifference, I should not only have been\ndepriving myself of one of the joys of which I had most often dreamed,\nI should have been fabricating, of my own free will, a love that was\nartificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose\nmysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have been declining to\nfollow.\n\nBut when I arrived at the Champs-Elys�es,--and, as at first sight\nit appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it\nundergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent\ncause--as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the\nsight of whom I had counted to revive the images that my tired memory\nhad lost and could not find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I\nhad been playing the day before, and whom I had just been prompted to\ngreet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when\nwe are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time\nto think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the\nlittle girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people.\nIf, for instance, I had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes\nabove plump and rosy cheeks, Gilberte's face would now offer me (and\nwith emphasis) something that I distinctly had not remembered, a\ncertain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously\nassociating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the\nimportance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used\nto define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind\nthat have sharpened profiles. While I was making myself ready to take\nadvantage of this long expected moment, and to surrender myself to the\nimpression of Gilberte which I had prepared beforehand but could no\nlonger find in my head, to an extent which would enable me, during the\nlong hours which I must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed\nherself whom I had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that I\nwas gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it, she\nthrew me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes\naccount of the external world in the reality of which his intellect\ndeclines to believe, the same self which had made me salute her before I\nhad identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me\n(as though she had been a companion, with whom I had come to play, and\nnot a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be united), made me,\nout of politeness, until the time came when she had to I go, address\na thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both\nfrom keeping a silence in which I might at last have laid my hand upon\nthe indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might\nhave made that definite progress in the course of our love on which I\nwas always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. There was,\nhowever, an occasional development. One day, we had gone with Gilberte\nto the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly\nnice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send for his\ngingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial\neczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great\nquantity,--Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who\nwere like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's\nstorybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock because\nhe preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes,\nrefused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he\nfinally explained in passionate tones: \"I want the other plum; it's got\na worm in it!\" I purchased two ha'penny marbles. With admiring eyes I\nsaw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles\nwhich seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as\nlittle girls, and because they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was\ngiven a great deal more pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I\nthought the prettiest. They were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as\nlife itself. I would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them.\nI should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all.\nStill, I pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte\ntook it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it,\npaid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: \"Take it; it\nis for you, I give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me.\"\n\nAnother time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in\nclassic drama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet\nin which Bergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She\nhad told me to let her know the exact title of it, and that evening\nI had sent her a little telegram, writing on its envelope the name,\nGilberte Swann, which I had so often, traced in my exercise-books. Next\nday she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white\nwax, the pamphlet, a copy of which she had managed to find. \"You see, it\nis what you asked me for,\" she said, taking from her muff the telegram\nthat I had sent her. But in the address on the pneumatic message--which,\nonly yesterday, was nothing, was merely a 'little blue' that I had\nwritten, and, after a messenger had delivered it to Gilberte's porter\nand a servant had taken it to her in her room, had become a thing\nwithout value or distinction, one of the 'little blues' that she had\nreceived in the course of the day--I had difficulty in recognising\nthe futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles\nstamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil by\na postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world,\nviolet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to\nespouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.\n\nAnd there was another day on which she said to me: \"You know, you may\ncall me 'Gilberte'; in any case, I'm going to call you by your first\nname. It's too silly not to.\" Yet she continued for a while to address\nme by the more formal '_vous_,' and, when I drew her attention to this,\nsmiled, and composing, constructing a phrase like those that are put\ninto the grammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to\nteach us to make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And\nwhen I recalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish\nthe impression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself,\nnaked, without, any longer, any of the social qualifications which\nbelonged equally to her other companions and, when she used my surname,\nto my parents, accessories of which her lips--by the effort that she\nmade, a little after her father's manner, to articulate the words to\nwhich she wished to give a special value--had the air of stripping, of\ndivesting me, as one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going\nto put only the pulp into one's mouth, while her glance, adapting itself\nto the same new degree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more\ndirectly, not without testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure,\neven the gratitude that it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.\n\nBut at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of\nthese new pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I\nloved, to me who loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to\nplay, to my other self, who possessed neither the memory of the true\nGilberte, nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value\nof a happiness for which it alone had longed. Even after I had returned\nhome I did not taste them, since, every day, the necessity which made\nme hope that on the morrow I should arrive at the clear, calm, happy\ncontemplation of Gilberte, that she would at last confess her love\nfor me, explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged,\nhitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity forced me to regard the\npast as of no account, to look ahead of me only, to consider the little\nadvantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were\nself-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which I might\nset my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step further and\nfinally to attain the happiness which I had not yet encountered.\n\nIf, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled\nme also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often\non the very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my\nhopes. I was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elys�es, and\nI felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great\nhappiness when--going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss\nMamma, who was already dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair\nelaborately built up, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant\nstill with soap--I had been apprised, by seeing a column of dust\nstanding by itself in the air above the piano, and by hearing a\nbarrel-organ playing, beneath the window, _En revenant de la revue_,\nthat the winter had received, until nightfall, an unexpected, radiant\nvisit from a day of spring. While we sat at luncheon, by opening her\nwindow, the lady opposite had sent packing, in the twinkling of an eye,\nfrom beside my chair--to sweep in a single stride over the whole width\nof our dining-room--a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday\nrest and returned to continue it there a moment later. At school, during\nthe one o'clock lesson, the sun made me sick with impatience and boredom\nas it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge of my desk, like\nan invitation to the feast at which I could not myself arrive before\nthree o'clock, until the moment when Fran�oise came to fetch me at the\nschool-gate, and we made our way towards the Champs-Elys�es through\nstreets decorated with sunlight, dense with people, over which the\nbalconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to float in\nfront of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the Champs-Elys�es\nI found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless, on the lawn\nnurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled to a flame\nthe point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon\nit had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick\nhad heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with my eyes fixed\non the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the form of\nGilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that\nseemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which\nglistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the\nsun. The old lady who read the D�bats was sitting on her chair, in her\ninvariable place, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly\nwave of her hands towards him as she exclaimed \"What a lovely day!\" And\nwhen the chair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of\nsmirks and affectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove,\nas though it had been a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in\ngratitude to the donor, the most becoming place upon her person. When\nshe had found it, she performed a circular movement with her neck,\nstraightened her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed\nher the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist, the\nbewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man, pointing to her\nbosom: \"You see, I'm wearing your roses!\"\n\nI dragged Fran�oise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc\nde Triomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn\nconvinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden\nhorses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me:\n\"Quick, quick, Gilberte's been here a quarter of an hour. She's just\ngoing. We've been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner's base.\"\n\nWhile I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elys�es, Gilberte had\narrived by the Rue Boissy-d'Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage\nof the fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was\ncoming to fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to\nhave strayed from the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what\ndirection Gilberte would appear, whether she would be early or late, and\nthis perpetual tension succeeded in making more impressive not only the\nChamps-Elys�es in their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon,\nlike a vast expanse of space and time, on every point and at every\nmoment of which it was possible that the form of Gilberte might appear,\nbut also that form itself, since behind its appearance I felt that there\nlay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart\nat four o'clock instead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat,\nfor paying calls, instead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the\nAmbassadeurs and not between the two puppet-shows; I divined one of\nthose occupations in which I might not follow Gilberte, occupations\nthat forced her to go out or to stay at home, I was in contact with the\nmystery of her unknown life. It was this mystery, too, which troubled\nme when, running at the sharp-voiced girl's bidding, so as to begin our\ngame without more delay, I saw Gilberte, so quick and informal with\nus, make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the _D�bats_ (who\nacknowledged it with \"What a lovely sun! You'd think there was a fire\nburning.\") speaking to her with a shy smile, with an air of constraint\nwhich called to my mind the other little girl that Gilberte must be when\nat home with her parents, or with friends of her parents, paying\nvisits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her existence. But of that\nexistence no one gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who\ncame a little later to fetch his daughter. That was because he and Mme.\nSwann--inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as her lessons,\nher games, her friendships depended upon them--contained for me, like\nGilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects that had\nan all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source, an\nundefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm. Everything that\nconcerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation\nthat the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had seen so\noften, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he\nwas still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the\nChamps-Elys�es, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited\nby the appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the\nsight of him still impressed me as might that of an historic personage,\nupon whom one had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest\ndetails of whose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with\nthe Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray,\nseemed to me unimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous,\nas if no one else had ever known the House of Orleans; they set him\nin vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians\nof different classes, who encumbered that particular path in the\nChamps-Elys�es, in the midst of whom I admired his condescending to\nfigure without claiming any special deference, which as it happened none\nof them dreamed of paying him, so profound was the incognito in which he\nwas wrapped.\n\nHe responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte's companions, even\nto mine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family,\nbut without appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had\nconstantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but\nkept out of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had\nbecome to me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann;\nas the ideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different\nfrom the ideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which\nI utilised not at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had\nbecome a new, another person; still I attached him by an artificial\nthread, secondary and transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing\nhad any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love\nmight profit by it, it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not\nbeing able to erase them from my memory that I recaptured the years in\nwhich, in the eyes of this same Swann who was at this moment before me\nin the Champs-Elys�es, and to whom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps\nnot mentioned my name, I had so often, in the evenings, made myself\nridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to come upstairs to my room to say\ngood-night to me, while she was drinking coffee with him and my father\nand my grandparents at the table in the garden.) He told Gilberte that\nshe might play one game; he could wait for a quarter of an hour; and,\nsitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron chair, paid for his\nticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often held in his own,\nwhile we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the pigeons, whose\nbeautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and, surely, the lilacs\nof the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many sanctuaries, one on\nthe great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it disappeared below the\nrim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of offering to the bird in\nabundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared to be pecking, another\non the head of the statue, which it seemed to crown with one of those\nenamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain classical works\nthe monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which, when the goddess\nbears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes of her, as a\ndifferent Christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity.\n\nOn one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, I had not\nthe courage to conceal my disappointment from Gilberte.\n\n\"I had ever so many things to ask you,\" I said to her; \"I thought that\nto-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. And no sooner have\nyou come than you go away! Try to come early to-morrow, so that I can\ntalk to you.\"\n\nHer face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: \"Tomorrow,\nyou may make up your mind, my dear friend, I sha'n't come!\n\n\"First of all I've a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon I\nam going to a friend's house to see King Theodosius arrive from her\nwindows; won't that be splendid?--and then, next day, I'm going to\n_Michel Strogoff_, and after that it will soon be Christmas, and the New\nYear holidays! Perhaps they'll take me south, to the Riviera; won't that\nbe nice? Though I should miss the Christmas-tree here; anyhow, if I do\nstay in Paris, I sha'n't be coming here, because I shall be out paying\ncalls with Mamma. Good-bye--there's Papa calling me.\"\n\nI returned home with Fran�oise through streets that were still gay with\nsunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. I\ncould scarcely drag my legs along.\n\n\"I'm not surprised;\" said Fran�oise, \"it's not the right weather for the\ntime of year; it's much too warm. Oh dear, oh dear, to think of all\nthe poor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up\nthere, too, everything's got out of order.\"\n\nI repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had\ngiven utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a\nlong time, to the Champs-Elys�es. But already the charm with which, by\nthe mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of\nher, the privileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which\nI was inevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a\nscar in my mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference\nsomething romantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape\nthemselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And\nwhen the time came for the postman I said to myself, that evening as on\nevery other: \"I am going to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to\ntell me, at last, that she has never ceased to love me, and to explain\nto me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her\nlove from me until now, to put on the appearance of being able to be\nhappy without seeing me; the reason for which she has assumed the form\nof the other Gilberte, who is simply a companion.\"\n\nEvery evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter,\nbelieving that I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences\nin turn. Suddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was\nto receive a letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this\nletter, since it was I myself who had just composed it. And from that\nmoment I would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I\nshould have liked her to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting\nthem myself, I should be excluding just those identical words,--the\ndearest, the most desired--from the field of possible events. Even if,\nby an almost impossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter\nof my invention that Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord,\nrecognising my own work in it I should not have had the impression that\nI was receiving something that had not originated in myself, something\nreal, something new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my\nwill, a gift indeed from love.\n\nWhile I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been\nwritten to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that\npage by Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine\ndrew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within\nreach. I was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book\nfor me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion,\nso much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves\nqualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are\nworthy to excite a man's love, that he assimilates them by imitation\nand makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these\nqualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would\nhave sought, so long as it was spontaneous--as Swann, before my day, had\nsought to establish the aesthetic basis of Odette's beauty--I, who had\nat first loved Gilberte, in Combray days, on account of all the unknown\nelement in her life into which I would fain have plunged headlong, have\nundergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing\nthat no longer mattered, I thought now, as of an inestimable advantage,\nthat of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence\nGilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the\ncomforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work,\nwould collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that\ninfinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom I had first,\nbefore I had even seen her, loved Gilberte, now it was for Gilberte's\nsake, chiefly, that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages that\nhe had written about Racine, I studied the wrapper, folded under great\nseals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she\nhad brought those pages to me. I kissed the agate marble, which was\nthe better part of my love's heart, the part that was not frivolous but\nfaithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of\nGilberte's life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my\nbed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages\nof Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of my love for\nGilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have\nany existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I perceived,\nanterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements\nhad been determined by the writer's talent, or by geological laws,\nbefore ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have\nbeen different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing,\nconsequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness.\nAnd while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a\nconfession of Gilberte's love for me, destroyed, unravelled every\nevening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being\nwas an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed\nthreads, but collected and rearranged them, without any thought of\npleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order\nwhich she gave to all her handiwork. Without any special interest in my\nlove, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she placed, side by\nside, those of Gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and\nher faults which I had excused. Then, one with another, they took on\na meaning. It seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when I saw\nGilberte, instead of coming to me in the Champs-Elys�es, going to a\nparty, or on errands with her governess, when I saw her prepared for\nan absence that would extend over the New Year holidays, I was wrong in\nthinking, in saying: \"It is because she is frivolous,\" or \"easily lead.\"\nFor she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she\nhad been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in\nher heart that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It shewed me\nfurther, this new arrangement, that I ought, after all, to know what\nit was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it drew my attention to the\nconstant anxiety that I had to 'shew off' before her, by reason of which\nI tried to persuade my mother to get for Fran�oise a waterproof coat and\na hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to\nthe Champs-Elys�es an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen (to all\nof which my mother replied that I was not fair to Fran�oise, that\nshe was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole,\nexclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that, months in\nadvance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she\nwould be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the most\nattractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she\nwere not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever\nin Paris, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elys�es; and it had\nlittle difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my\nneed could be justified by anything in Gilberte's conduct. She, on the\ncontrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself\nover what I might choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to\nher not to come to the Champs-Elys�es if she had to go shopping with\nMademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother.\nAnd even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my\nholidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing\nthat place she considered her parents' wishes, a thousand different\namusements of which she had been told, and not at all that it should be\nthe place to which my family were proposing to send me. When she assured\nme (as sometimes happened) that she liked me less than some other of\nher friends, less than she had liked me the day before, because by my\nclumsiness I had made her side lose a game, I would beg her pardon, I\nwould beg her to tell me what I must do in order that she should begin\nagain to like me as much as, or more than the rest; I hoped to hear her\nsay that that was already my position; I besought her; as though she had\nbeen able to modify her affection for me as she or I chose, to give me\npleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as my good or bad\nconduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt,\nmyself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires?\n\nIt shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver,\nthat, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has\nhitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed\nin their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a\nlight to which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what\nwill be that person's actions on the morrow.\n\nThese new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it\nthat the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone\nbefore; that Gilberte's feeling for me, too long established now to\nbe capable of alteration, was indifference; that in my friendship with\nGilberte, it was I alone who loved. \"That is true,\" my love responded,\n\"there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter\nnow.\" And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public\nholiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year,\nperhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time\nstarts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its\nlegacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and\nto join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.\n\n* * *\n\nI had always, within reach, a plan of Paris, which, because I could see\ndrawn on it the street in which M. and Mme. Swann lived, seemed to me to\ncontain a secret treasure. And to please myself, as well as by a sort\nof chivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, I\nwould repeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like\nmy mother and grandmother, in the secret of my love, would ask: \"But\nwhy are you always talking about that street? There's nothing wonderful\nabout it. It is an admirable street to live in because it's only a few\nminutes' walk from the Bois, but there are a dozen other streets just\nthe same.\"\n\nI made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation\nwith my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it;\nbut I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself\nplay that chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice\nme. Moreover, that name of Swann, with which I had for so long been\nfamiliar, was to me now (as happens at times to people suffering from\naphasia, in the case of the most ordinary words) the name of something\nnew. It was for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow\naccustomed to it. I analysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me\nas a surprise. And with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its\ninnocence. The pleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to\nbe so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my\nthoughts, and would change the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it\nin that direction. I fell back upon subjects which still brought me into\ntouch with Gilberte, I eternally repeated the same words, and it was no\nuse my knowing that they were but words--words uttered in her absence,\nwhich she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating\nwhat were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them--for still\nit seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way\neverything that had reference to Gilberte, I might perhaps make emerge\nfrom it something that would bring me happiness. I told my parents again\nthat Gilberte was very fond of her governess, as if the statement, when\nrepeated for the hundredth time, would at last have the effect of making\nGilberte suddenly burst into the room, come to live with us for ever.\nI had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the _D�bats_\n(I had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an Ambassador's\nwidow, if not actually a Highness) and I continued to descant on her\nbeauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the day on which I mentioned\nthat, by what I had heard Gilberte call her, she appeared to be a Mme.\nBlatin.\n\n\"Oh, now I know whom you mean,\" cried my mother, while I felt myself\ngrow red all over with shame. \"On guard! on guard!--as your grandfather\nsays. And so it's she that you think so wonderful? Why, she's perfectly\nhorrible, and always has been. She's the widow of a bailiff. You can't\nremember, when you were little, all the trouble I used to have to avoid\nher at your gymnastic lessons, where she was always trying to get hold\nof me--I didn't know the woman, of course--to tell me that you were\n'much too nice-looking for a boy.' She has always had an insane desire\nto get to know people, and she must be quite insane, as I have always\nthought, if she really does know Mme. Swann. For even if she does come\nof very common people, I have never heard anything said against her\ncharacter. But she must always be forcing herself upon strangers. She\nis, really, a horrible woman, frightfully vulgar, and besides, she is\nalways creating awkward situations.\"\n\nAs for Swann, in my attempts to resemble him, I spent the whole time,\nwhen I was at table, in drawing my finger along my nose and in rubbing\nmy eyes. My father would exclaim: \"The child's a perfect idiot, he's\nbecoming quite impossible.\" More than all else I should have liked to\nbe as bald as Swann. He appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary\nthat I found it impossible to believe that people whom I knew and often\nsaw knew him also, and that in the course of the day anyone might run\nagainst him. And once my mother, while she was telling us, as she did\nevery evening at dinner, where she had been and what she had done that\nafternoon, merely by the words: \"By the way, guess whom I saw at the\nTrois Quartiers--at the umbrella counter--Swann!\" caused to burst open\nin the midst of her narrative (an arid desert to me) a mystic blossom.\nWhat a melancholy satisfaction to learn that, that very afternoon,\nthreading through the crowd his supernatural form, Swann had gone to\nbuy an umbrella. Among the events of the day, great and small, but\nall equally unimportant, that one alone aroused in me those peculiar\nvibrations by which my love for Gilberte was invariably stirred. My\nfather complained that I took no interest in anything, because I did not\nlisten while he was speaking of the political developments that might\nfollow the visit of King Theodosius, at that moment in France as\nthe nation's guest and (it was hinted) ally. And yet how intensely\ninterested I was to know whether Swann had been wearing his hooded cape!\n\n\"Did you speak to him?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, of course I did,\" answered my mother, who always seemed afraid\nlest, were she to admit that we were not on the warmest of terms with\nSwann, people would seek to reconcile us more than she cared for, in\nview of the existence of Mme. Swann, whom she did not wish to know. \"It\nwas he who came up and spoke to me. I hadn't seen him.\"\n\n\"Then you haven't quarrelled?\"\n\n\"Quarrelled? What on earth made you think that we had quarrelled?\"\nshe briskly parried, as though I had cast doubt on the fiction of her\nfriendly relations with Swann, and was planning an attempt to 'bring\nthem together.'\n\n\"He might be cross with you for never asking him here.\"\n\n\"One isn't obliged to ask everyone to one's house, you know; has he ever\nasked me to his? I don't know his wife.\"\n\n\"But he used often to come, at Combray.\"\n\n\"I should think he did! He used to come at Combray, and now, in Paris,\nhe has something better to do, and so have I. But I can promise you, we\ndidn't look in the least like people who had quarrelled. We were kept\nwaiting there for some time, while they brought him his parcel. He\nasked after you; he told me you had been playing with his daughter--\"\nmy mother went on, amazing me with the portentous revelation of my own\nexistence in Swann's mind; far more than that, of my existence in so\ncomplete, so material a form that when I stood before him, trembling\nwith love, in the Champs-Elys�es, he had known my name, and who my\nmother was, and had been able to blend with my quality as his daughter's\nplaymate certain facts with regard to my grandparents and their\nconnections, the place in which we lived, certain details of our past\nlife, all of which I myself perhaps did not know. But my mother did not\nseem to have noticed anything particularly attractive in that counter at\nthe Trois Quartiers where she had represented to Swann, at the moment\nin which he caught sight of her, a definite person with whom he had\nsufficient memories in common to impel him to come up to her and to\nspeak.\n\nNor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention\nSwann's family, the grandparents of Gilberte, nor to use the title of\nstockbroker, topics than which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure.\nMy imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a\ncertain family, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a\ncertain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its\nwindows precious. But these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as\nmy father and mother looked upon the house in which Swann lived as one\nthat closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the\nneighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann's family seemed to them to be in the\nsame category as many other families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was\nmore or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in\nquestion shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe,\nand there was about it nothing that they could call unique. What, on the\nother hand, they did appreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if\nnot in greater measure elsewhere. And so, after admitting that the house\nwas in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house\nthat was in a better, but had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of\nfinanciers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they\nhad appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake\nwhich was very soon corrected. For in order to distinguish in all\nGilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale\nof emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a\nsupplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the\ntime being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked.\n\nOn the days when Gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to\nthe Champs-Elys�es, I would try to arrange my walks so that I should\nbe brought into some kind of contact with her. Sometimes I would lead\nFran�oise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the Swanns lived, making\nher repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess\nwith regard to Mme. Swann. \"It seems, she puts great faith in medals.\nShe would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an\nowl hoot, or the death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat\nat midnight, or if the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she's a most\nreligious lady, she is!\" I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if,\non our way, I caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my\nemotion would bring me to a standstill, I would fasten on his white\nwhiskers eyes that melted with passion. And Fran�oise would rouse me\nwith: \"What's wrong with you now, child?\" and we would continue on our\nway until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every\nother porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his\nlivery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt to be latent in\nthe name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that I was one\nof those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from\npenetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty\nto guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of\nbeing protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly\nsweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the\nworld than to Gilberte's glancing eyes. On other days we would go along\nthe boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue Duphot;\nI had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way\nto the dentist's; and my imagination so far differentiated Gilberte's\nfather from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd\nof real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even\nbefore we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at\nthe thought that I was approaching a street from which that supernatural\napparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares.\n\nBut most often of all, on days when I was not to see Gilberte, as I\nhad heard that Mme. Swann walked almost every day along the All�e des\nAcacias, round the big lake, and in the All�e de la Reine Marguerite, I\nwould guide Fran�oise in the direction of the Bois de Boulogne. It was\nto me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled\ntogether a variety of flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where\nfrom a hill one passes to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench,\nanother hill, a marsh, but knows that they are there only to enable\nthe hippopotamus, zebra, crocodile, rabbit, bear and heron to disport\nthemselves in a natural or a picturesque setting; this, the Bois,\nequally complex, uniting a multitude of little worlds, distinct and\nseparate--placing a stage set with red trees, American oaks, like an\nexperimental forest in Virginia, next to a fir-wood by the edge of the\nlake, or to a forest grove from which would suddenly emerge, in her\nlissom covering of furs, with the large, appealing eyes of a dumb\nanimal, a hastening walker--was the Garden of Woman; and like the\nmyrtle-alley in the Aeneid, planted for their delight with trees of one\nkind only, the All�e des Acacias was thronged by the famous Beauties\nof the day. As, from a long way off, the sight of the jutting crag from\nwhich it dives into the pool thrills with joy the children who know\nthat they are going to behold the seal, long before I reached the\nacacia-alley, their fragrance, scattered abroad, would make me feel that\nI was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable personality,\nstrong and tender; then, as I drew near, the sight of their topmost\nbranches, their lightly tossing foliage, in its easy grace, its\ncoquettish outline, its delicate fabric, over which hundreds of flowers\nwere laid, like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects; and\nfinally their name itself, feminine, indolent and seductive, made my\nheart beat, but with a social longing, like those waltzes which remind\nus only of the names of the fair dancers, called aloud as they entered\nthe ball-room. I had been told that I should see in the alley certain\nwomen of fashion, who, in spite of their not all having husbands, were\nconstantly mentioned in conjunction with Mme. Swann, but most often by\ntheir professional names;--their new names, when they had any, being\nbut a sort of incognito, a veil which those who would speak of them were\ncareful to draw aside, so as to make themselves understood. Thinking\nthat Beauty--in the order of feminine elegance--was governed by occult\nlaws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they\nhad the power to realise it, I accepted before seeing them, like the\ntruth of a coming revelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their\ncarriages and horses, of a thousand details among which I placed my\nfaith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to\nthat ephemeral and changing pageant. But it was Mme. Swann whom I wished\nto see, and I waited for her to go past, as deeply moved as though\nshe were Gilberte, whose parents, saturated, like everything in her\nenvironment, with her own special charm, excited in me as keen a passion\nas she did herself, indeed a still more painful disturbance (since their\npoint of contact with her was that intimate, that internal part of\nher life which was hidden from me), and furthermore, for I very soon\nlearned, as we shall see in due course, that they did not like my\nplaying with her, that feeling of veneration which we always have for\nthose who hold, and exercise without restraint, the power to do us an\ninjury.\n\nI assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of\nsocial grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a\n'polonaise' of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a\npheasant's wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the\nAll�e des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her\nown house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the\ngentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were\nraising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never\nanyone so well turned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to\nostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled\nFran�oise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs\nwere 'giving' beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another\nhour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for\nme a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as\nno real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of\ntheir power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience--borne\nalong by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as\none sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an\nenormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive\ngroom, like Toby, \"the late Beaudenord's tiger,\" I saw--or rather I\nfelt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab--a\nmatchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme\nmodernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down\nin which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with\none grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from\nwhich floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips\nan ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension\nof Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the\ncourtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her.\nThat smile was, in reality, saying to one: \"Oh yes, I do remember, quite\nwell; it was wonderful!\" to another: \"How I should have loved to! We\nwere unfortunate!\", to a third: \"Yes, if you like! I must just keep in\nthe line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will break away.\" When\nstrangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy\nsmile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which made them\nsay: \"What a lovely woman!\". And for certain men only she had a sour,\nstrained, shy, cold smile which meant: \"Yes, you old goat, I know\nthat you've got a tongue like a viper, that you can't keep quiet for a\nmoment. But do you suppose that I care what you say?\" Coquelin passed,\ntalking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of\nhis hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But\nI thought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her,\nfor I knew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would\ntell her coachman to 'break away' and to stop the carriage, so that she\nmight come back on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage\nto pass close by her I would drag Fran�oise off in that direction; until\nthe moment came when I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long\ntrain of her lilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be\ndressed, in rich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering\nher eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant\nattention to the passers-by, as though the important thing for her, her\none object in being there, was to take exercise, without thinking that\nshe was seen, and that every head was turned towards her. Sometimes,\nhowever, when she had looked back to call her dog to her, she would\ncast, almost imperceptibly, a sweeping glance round about.\n\nThose even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional,\nsomething beyond the normal in her--or perhaps by a telepathic\nsuggestion such as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of\napplause when Berma was 'sublime'--that she must be some one well-known.\nThey would ask one another, \"Who is she?\", or sometimes would\ninterrogate a passing stranger, or would make a mental note of how she\nwas dressed so as to fix her identity, later, in the mind of a friend\nbetter informed than themselves, who would at once enlighten them.\nAnother pair, half-stopping in their walk, would exchange:\n\n\"You know who that is? Mme. Swann! That conveys nothing to you? Odette\nde Cr�cy, then?\"\n\n\"Odette de Cr�cy! Why, I thought as much. Those great, sad eyes... But I\nsay, you know, she can't be as young as she was once, eh? I remember, I\nhad her on the day that MacMahon went.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't remind her of it, if I were you. She is now Mme. Swann, the\nwife of a gentleman in the Jockey Club, a friend of the Prince of Wales.\nApart from that, though, she is wonderful still.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you ought to have known her then; Gad, she was lovely!\nShe lived in a very odd little house with a lot of Chinese stuff.\nI remember, we were bothered all the time by the newsboys, shouting\noutside; in the end she made me get up and go.\"\n\nWithout listening to these memories, I could feel all about her the\nindistinct murmur of fame. My heart leaped with impatience when I\nthought that a few seconds must still elapse before all these people,\namong whom I was dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who (or\nso I felt) had a contempt for me, were to see the unknown youth, to\nwhom they had not, so far, been paying the slightest attention, salute\n(without knowing her, it was true, but I thought that I had sufficient\nauthority since my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter's\nplaymate) this woman whose reputation for beauty, for misconduct, and\nfor elegance was universal. But I was now close to Mme. Swann; I pulled\noff my hat with so lavish, so prolonged a gesture that she could not\nrepress a smile. People laughed. As for her, she had never seen me with\nGilberte, she did not know my name, but I was for her--like one of the\nkeepers in the Bois, like the boatman, or the ducks on the lake, to\nwhich she threw scraps of bread--one of the minor personages, familiar,\nnameless, as devoid of individual character as a stage-hand in a\ntheatre, of her daily walks abroad.\n\nOn certain days when I had missed her in the All�e des Acacias I would\nbe so fortunate as to meet her in the All�e de la Reine Marguerite,\nwhere women went who wished to be alone, or to appear to be wishing to\nbe alone; she would not be alone for long, being soon overtaken by some\nman or other, often in a grey 'tile' hat, whom I did not know, and\nwho would talk to her for some time, while their two carriages crawled\nbehind.\n\n* * *\n\nThat sense of the complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which made it an\nartificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the\nword, a Garden, I captured again, this year, as I crossed it on my way\nto Trianon, on one of those mornings, early in November, when in Paris,\nif we stay indoors, being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the\ntransformation scene of autumn, which is drawing so rapidly to a close\nwithout our assistance, we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that\nbecomes a fever, and may even keep us awake at night. Into my closed\nroom they had been drifting already for a month, summoned there by\nmy desire to see them, slipping between my thoughts and the object,\nwhatever it might be, upon which I was trying to concentrate them,\nwhirling in front of me like those brown spots that sometimes, whatever\nwe may be looking at, will seem to be dancing or swimming before our\neyes. And on that morning, not hearing the splash of the rain as on the\nprevious days, seeing the smile of fine weather at the corners of my\ndrawn curtains, as from the corners of closed lips may escape the secret\nof their happiness, I had felt that I could actually see those yellow\nleaves, with the light shining through them, in their supreme beauty;\nand being no more able to restrain myself from going to look at the\ntrees than, in my childhood's days, when the wind howled in the chimney,\nI had been able to resist the longing to visit the sea, I had risen and\nleft the house to go to Trianon, passing through the Bois de Boulogne.\nIt was the hour and the season in which the Bois seems, perhaps, most\nmultiform, not only because it is then most divided, but because it\nis divided in a different way. Even in the unwooded parts, where the\nhorizon is large, here and there against the background of a dark\nand distant mass of trees, now leafless or still keeping their summer\nfoliage unchanged, a double row of orange-red chestnuts seemed, as in a\npicture just begun, to be the only thing painted, so far, by an artist\nwho had not yet laid any colour on the rest, and to be offering their\ncloister, in full daylight, for the casual exercise of the human figures\nthat would be added to the picture later on.\n\nFarther off, at a place where the trees were still all green, one alone,\nsmall, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance, was tossing\nin the breeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again, might be seen\nthe first awakening of this Maytime of the leaves, and those of an\nampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter,\nhad that very morning all 'come out,' so to speak, in blossom. And the\nBois had the temporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden\nor a park in which, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation\nfor a festival, there have been embedded among the trees of commoner\ngrowth, which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a\nfew rare specimens, with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing\nall round themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing\nlight. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne\ndisplays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct elements\nin a composite whole than at any other. It was also the time of day.\nIn places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to have\nundergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they\nwere touched by the sun's light, still, at this hour in the morning,\nalmost horizontal, as it would be again, a few hours later, at the\nmoment when, just as dusk began, it would flame up like a lamp, project\nafar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow, and set ablaze the few\ntopmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre\nincombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the\nlight grew solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian\nmasonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of\nthe chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which\nthey stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the trunk\nof a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and brought to\nblossom, too dazzling to be clearly distinguished, an enormous posy,\nof red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of carnation. The\ndifferent parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in summer in the\ndensity and monotony of their universal green, were now clearly divided.\nA patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of\nthem, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an\noriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville, the\nPr� Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here and\nthere would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for\nwhich the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne\nupon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the\nBois was not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the\nlife of its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration\nof the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which\nthe heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause, without\nunderstanding that it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed\nat the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and,\nwithout my knowledge, directed itself towards that masterpiece of\nbeautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every\nday. I walked towards the All�e des Acacias. I passed through forest\ngroves in which the morning light, breaking them into new sections,\nlopped and trimmed the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made\nnosegays of their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of\ntrees; making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would\ncut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and, weaving\ntogether the two halves that remained, would make of them either a\nsingle pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light, or a single\nluminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour was encompassed\nin a network of inky shadows. When a ray of sunshine gilded the highest\nbranches, they seemed, soaked and still dripping with a sparkling\nmoisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid, emerald-green\natmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the\nsea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality, and when\nthey had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more brightly still\nfrom the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or in the white\nenamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to\nthe topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in\nMichelangelo's 'Creation.' But, forced for so many years now, by a sort\nof grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they called\nto my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly walking,\nbrightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as she\npassed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves\nacknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy\ndays when I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the\nspots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few\nmoments beneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty\nfor which the firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long,\nmore disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of\nTrianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself\nin the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a little\ntemple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves\nribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as\nthe pigeon-shooting ground. The idea of perfection which I had within me\nI had bestowed, in that other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon\nthe raking thinness of those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon\nthe wing, with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which\nnow, smitten by a desire to see again what I had once loved, as ardent\nas the desire that had driven me, many years before, along the same\npaths, I wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme.\nSwann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his\nfist, and as infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to\ncurb the ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they\nthundered along the ground. Alas! there was nothing now but motor-cars\ndriven each by a moustached mechanic, with a tall footman towering by\nhis side. I wished to hold before my bodily eyes, that I might know\nwhether they were indeed as charming as they appeared to the eyes of\nmemory, little hats, so low-crowned as to seem no more than garlands\nabout the brows of women. All the hats now were immense; covered with\nfruits and flowers and all manner of birds. In place of the lovely gowns\nin which Mme. Swann walked like a Queen, appeared Greco-Saxon tunics,\nwith Tanagra folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire style, 'Liberty\nchiffons' sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper. On the heads\nof the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with Mme. Swann\nin the All�e de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey 'tile' hats\nof old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois bare-headed. And seeing\nall these new elements of the spectacle, I had no longer the faith\nwhich, applied to them, would have given them consistency, unity,\nlife; they passed in a scattered sequence before me, at random, without\nreality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have\nendeavoured as in the old days, to extract from them and to compose in\na picture. They were just women, in whose elegance I had no belief,\nand whose clothes seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes,\nthere survives it--more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence\nof the power, now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena--an\nidolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did\nonce animate, as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the\ndivine spark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a contingent\ncause--the death of the gods.\n\n\"Oh, horrible!\" I exclaimed to myself: \"Does anyone really imagine that\nthese motor-cars are as smart as the old carriage-and-pair? I dare say.\nI am too old now--but I was not intended for a world in which women\nshackle themselves in garments that are not even made of cloth. To what\npurpose shall I walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of\nthe assembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening\nleaves, if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing\nthat once their branches framed? Oh, horrible! My consolation is to\nthink of the women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is\nno standard left of elegance. But how can the people who watch these\ndreadful creatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped\nthe spoils of aviary or garden-bed,--how can they imagine the charm that\nthere was in the sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac\nbonnet, or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a\nsingle iris?\" Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that\nI used to feel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an\notter-skin coat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like\npartridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial\nwarmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the\nbunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue\nagainst the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same\ncharming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting,\nand of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this\nwoman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the\nblazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked\nout through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have\nsufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as\nin those distant years. Because of the solidarity that binds together\nthe different parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps\nin a balanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to\ndecline any fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest\nof the day with one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house\nwith dark-painted walls (as Mme. Swann's were still in the year after\nthat in which the first part of this story ends) against which would\nglow the orange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering\nof her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments\nsimilar to those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to\ndiscover the pleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led\nto nothing, those moments struck me as having been charming enough in\nthemselves. I sought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas!\nthere was nothing now but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all\nwhite paint, with hortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not\nreturn to Paris, now, until much later. Mme. Swann would have written to\nme, from a country house, that she would not be in town before February,\nhad I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which\nI felt to belong to a distant era, to a date in time towards which it\nwas forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope, the elements of that\nlonging which had become, itself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that\nit had once vainly pursued. And I should have required also that they\nbe the same women, those whose costume interested me because, at a time\nwhen I still had faith, my imagination had individualised them and had\nprovided each of them with a legend. Alas! in the acacia-avenue--the\nmyrtle-alley--I did see some of them again, grown old, no more now\nthan grim spectres of what once they had been, wandering to and fro, in\ndesperate search of heaven knew what, through the Virgilian groves. They\nhad long fled, and still I stood vainly questioning the deserted paths.\nThe sun's face was hidden. Nature began again to reign over the Bois,\nfrom which had vanished all trace of the idea that it was the Elysian\nGarden of Woman; above the gimcrack windmill the real sky was grey; the\nwind wrinkled the surface of the Grand Lac in little wavelets, like\na real lake; large birds passed swiftly over the Bois, as over a real\nwood, and with shrill cries perched, one after another, on the great\noaks which, beneath their Druidical crown, and with Dodonaic majesty,\nseemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this estranged forest, and\nhelped me to understand how paradoxical it is to seek in reality for the\npictures that are stored in one's memory, which must inevitably lose\nthe charm that comes to them from memory itself and from their not\nbeing apprehended by the senses. The reality that I had known no longer\nexisted. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in the same attire\nand at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be altered. The places\nthat we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which\nwe map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a\nthin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our\nlife at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a\nparticular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as\nthe years.", "title": "Swann's Way"}
