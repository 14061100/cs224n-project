{"summary": "Ethan Frome is set in the fictional New England town of Starkfield, where a visiting engineer tells the story of his encounter with Ethan Frome, a man with a history of thwarted dreams and desires. The accumulated longing of Frome ends in an ironic turn of events. His initial impressions are based on his observations of Frome going about his mundane tasks in Starkfield, and something about him catches the eye and curiosity of the visitor, but no one in the town seems interested in revealing many details about the man or his history - or perhaps they are not able to. The narrator ultimately finds himself in the position of staying overnight at Frome's house in order to escape a winter storm, and from there he observes Frome and his private circumstances, which he shares and which triggers other people in town to be more forthcoming with their own knowledge and impressions.\nThe novel is framed by the literary device of an extended flashback. The prologue, which is neither named as such nor numbered, opens with an unnamed male narrator spending a winter in Starkfield while in the area on business. He spots a limping, quiet man around the village, who is somehow compelling in his demeanor and carriage. This is Ethan Frome, who is a local fixture of the community, having been a lifelong resident. Frome is described as \"the most striking figure in Starkfield\", \"the ruin of a man\" with a \"careless powerful look…in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain\". Curious, the narrator sets out to learn about him. He learns that Frome's limp arose from having been injured in a \"smash-up\" twenty-four years before, but further details are not forthcoming, and the narrator fails to learn much more from Frome's fellow townspeople other than that Ethan's attempt at higher education decades before was thwarted by the sudden illness of his father following an injury, forcing his return to the farm to assist his parents, never to leave again. Because people seem to not wish to speak other than in vague and general terms about Frome's past, the narrator's curiosity grows, but he learns little more.\nChance circumstances arise that allow the narrator to hire Frome as his driver for a week. A severe snowstorm during one of their journeys forces Frome to allow the narrator to shelter at his home one night. Just as the two are entering Frome's house, the prologue ends. We then embark on the \"first\" chapter (Chapter I), which takes place twenty-four years prior. The narration switches from the first-person narrator of the prologue to a limited third-person narrator.\n\nIn Chapter I, Ethan is waiting outside a church dance for Mattie, his wife’s cousin, who has for a year lived with Ethan and his sickly wife, Zeena (Zenobia), in order to help out around the house and farm. Mattie is given the occasional night off to entertain herself in town as partial recompense for helping care for the Fromes, and Ethan has the duty of walking her home. It is quickly clear that Ethan has deep feelings for Mattie. Passing the graveyard, he thinks in an intense moment of foreshadowing that, \"We'll always go on living here together, and some day she'll lie there beside me.\" It also becomes clear that Zeena has observed enough to understand that he has these feelings and, understandably, she resents them.\nWhen Zeena leaves for an overnight visit to seek treatment for her various complaints and symptoms in a neighboring town, Ethan is excited to have an evening alone with Mattie. During this evening, the narrator reveals small actions that show that they each have feelings for the other, including a lingering of touching hands on the milk jug, although neither openly declares their love. Mattie makes supper and retrieves from a high shelf Zeena's treasured pickle dish, which Zeena, in a symbol of her stingy nature, never uses, in order to protect it. Mattie uses it to present Ethan with a simple supper, and disaster ensues when the Frome's cat jumps on the table and knocks it off, shattering it beyond repair. Ethan tries to help by setting the dish's pieces neatly in the cupboard, presenting the false impression of wholeness if not examined closely, with plans to purchase some glue and fix it as soon as he can.\nIn the morning Ethan’s hopes for more private time with Mattie are foiled by the presence of his hired man. Ethan then goes into town to buy glue for the broken pickle dish, and upon his return finds that Zeena has also come home. Zeena retreats upstairs, proclaiming her illness, and refusing supper because she is not hungry. There, she informs Ethan that she plans to send Mattie away and has already hired another girl to replace her, claiming that she needs someone more efficient because her health is failing more rapidly than ever.\nEthan is angry and frustrated to the point of panic by the thought of losing Mattie, and he is also worried for Mattie, who has no other place to go and no way to support herself in the world. He returns to the kitchen and joins Mattie, and tries to eat, but he is distraught and suddenly blurts out Zeena’s plans to send Mattie away. Mattie reacts with shock but rapid acceptance, trying to calm Ethan, while Ethan becomes more agitated and begins to insist that he will not let her go. At this moment, they are interrupted by Zeena, who has decided that she is hungry after all. After supper, Zeena discovers the broken pickle dish and is heartbroken and enraged; this betrayal cements her determination to send Mattie away.\nEthan, miserable at the thought of losing Mattie and worried sick about her fate, considers running away with Mattie, but he lacks the money to do so. He feels that he cannot abandon Zeena because he knows that she would neither be able to run the farm nor sell it (the poor quality of the place has been discussed at several points in the story already). Every plan he thinks of is impossible to carry out, and he remains in despair and frantically trying to think of a way to change this one more turn of events against his ability to have a happy life.\nThe next morning, Zeena describes her specific and imminent plans for sending Mattie on her way. Panicked, Ethan rushes into town to try to get a cash advance from a customer for a load of lumber in order to have the money with which to elope with Mattie. His plan is unhinged by guilt, however, when his customer’s wife expresses compassion, understanding, and empathy for Ethan's lot, which has involved the repeated duty to care for others, first his parents, then his sickly wife. He realizes that, of all people, he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of money, since she is one of the only people who have ever seemed to have seen or openly acknowledged Ethan's lifelong plight, as well as his honor in fulfilling his duties.\nEthan returns to the farm and picks up Mattie to take her to the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as a way of delaying their sad parting, after which they anticipate never seeing each other again. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. Ethan first refuses to go through with the plan, but in his despair that mirrors Mattie's, he ultimately agrees, and they get on the sled, clutching each other. On the way down, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash headlong and at high speed into the elm tree. Ethan regains consciousness after the accident but Mattie lies beside him, \"cheeping\" in pain like a small wounded animal. Ethan is also injured, and the reader is left to understand that this was the \"smash-up\" that left Ethan with a permanent limp.\nThe final chapter or epilogue (again unnumbered like the prologue), switches back to the first-person narrator point of view of the prologue, as Frome and his visitor, the narrator, enter the Frome household two decades later. The narrator hears a complaining female voice, and it is easy to assume that it belongs to the never-happy Zeena, but in the final twist of the story, it emerges that it is in fact Mattie, who now lives with the Fromes due to having been paralyzed in the accident. Her misery over her plight and dependence has embittered and \"soured\" her, and, with roles reversed, Zeena is now forced to care for her as well as Ethan. Further illustrating the psychosomatic nature of most of Zeena's previous complaints, she has now found the strength through necessity to be the caregiver rather than being the invalid. In an agonizing irony, Ethan and Mattie have gotten their wish to stay together, but in mutual unhappiness and discontent, with Mattie helpless and paralyzed, and with Zeena as a constant presence between the two of them. True to the foreshadowing, \"We'll always go on living here together, and some day she'll lie there beside me,\" they are in a kind of living hell until they all die and are laid to rest in the graveyard that prompted this thought of his 24 years ago.\n\nEthan Frome was written while Edith Wharton was living at The Mount, her home in Lenox, Massachusetts. Wharton likely based the story on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox, Massachusetts. Five people total were involved in the real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at the Lenox Library. The story of Ethan Frome had initially begun as a French-language composition that Wharton had to write while studying the language in Paris. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting. The novel also incorporates a frame narrative, the telling of a story within another story. The audience is first introduced to the narrator's story of meeting Ethan Frome and is later told the story of the accident and events surrounding it in a flashback.\nLenox is also where Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with one of the victims of the accident. Ethan and Mattie cannot escape their dreary life in Starkfield. The connection between the land and the people is a recurring theme of the novel. The narrator is amazed by the harshness of the Starkfield winters and through his experience of the winter he comes to understand the character of the people. In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the \"outcropping granite\" of New England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. The connection between land and people is very much a part of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield's winters.\n\n", "full_text": "ETHAN FROME\n\n\nBy Edith Wharton\n\n\n\n\nETHAN FROME\n\n\n\nI had the story, bit by bit, from various people, and, as generally\nhappens in such cases, each time it was a different story.\n\nIf you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post-office. If you\nknow the post-office you must have seen Ethan Frome drive up to it, drop\nthe reins on his hollow-backed bay and drag himself across the brick\npavement to the white colonnade; and you must have asked who he was.\n\nIt was there that, several years ago, I saw him for the first time; and\nthe sight pulled me up sharp. Even then he was the most striking figure\nin Starkfield, though he was but the ruin of a man. It was not so much\nhis great height that marked him, for the \"natives\" were easily singled\nout by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: it was the\ncareless powerful look he had, in spite of a lameness checking each step\nlike the jerk of a chain. There was something bleak and unapproachable\nin his face, and he was so stiffened and grizzled that I took him for an\nold man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two.\nI had this from Harmon Gow, who had driven the stage from Bettsbridge\nto Starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the\nfamilies on his line.\n\n\"He's looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; and that's\ntwenty-four years ago come next February,\" Harmon threw out between\nreminiscent pauses.\n\nThe \"smash-up\" it was--I gathered from the same informant--which, besides\ndrawing the red gash across Ethan Frome's forehead, had so shortened and\nwarped his right side that it cost him a visible effort to take the few\nsteps from his buggy to the post-office window. He used to drive in\nfrom his farm every day at about noon, and as that was my own hour for\nfetching my mail I often passed him in the porch or stood beside him\nwhile we waited on the motions of the distributing hand behind the\ngrating. I noticed that, though he came so punctually, he seldom\nreceived anything but a copy of the Bettsbridge Eagle, which he put\nwithout a glance into his sagging pocket. At intervals, however, the\npost-master would hand him an envelope addressed to Mrs. Zenobia--or Mrs.\nZeena--Frome, and usually bearing conspicuously in the upper left-hand\ncorner the address of some manufacturer of patent medicine and the name\nof his specific. These documents my neighbour would also pocket without\na glance, as if too much used to them to wonder at their number and\nvariety, and would then turn away with a silent nod to the post-master.\n\nEvery one in Starkfield knew him and gave him a greeting tempered to\nhis own grave mien; but his taciturnity was respected and it was only on\nrare occasions that one of the older men of the place detained him for\na word. When this happened he would listen quietly, his blue eyes on the\nspeaker's face, and answer in so low a tone that his words never reached\nme; then he would climb stiffly into his buggy, gather up the reins in\nhis left hand and drive slowly away in the direction of his farm.\n\n\"It was a pretty bad smash-up?\" I questioned Harmon, looking after\nFrome's retreating figure, and thinking how gallantly his lean brown\nhead, with its shock of light hair, must have sat on his strong\nshoulders before they were bent out of shape.\n\n\"Wust kind,\" my informant assented. \"More'n enough to kill most men. But\nthe Fromes are tough. Ethan'll likely touch a hundred.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" I exclaimed. At the moment Ethan Frome, after climbing to\nhis seat, had leaned over to assure himself of the security of a wooden\nbox--also with a druggist's label on it--which he had placed in the back\nof the buggy, and I saw his face as it probably looked when he thought\nhimself alone. \"That man touch a hundred? He looks as if he was dead and\nin hell now!\"\n\nHarmon drew a slab of tobacco from his pocket, cut off a wedge and\npressed it into the leather pouch of his cheek. \"Guess he's been in\nStarkfield too many winters. Most of the smart ones get away.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he?\"\n\n\"Somebody had to stay and care for the folks. There warn't ever anybody\nbut Ethan. Fust his father--then his mother--then his wife.\"\n\n\"And then the smash-up?\"\n\nHarmon chuckled sardonically. \"That's so. He had to stay then.\"\n\n\"I see. And since then they've had to care for him?\"\n\nHarmon thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek. \"Oh, as to\nthat: I guess it's always Ethan done the caring.\"\n\nThough Harmon Gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moral\nreach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts, and I had\nthe sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps. But\none phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which I\ngrouped my subsequent inferences: \"Guess he's been in Starkfield too\nmany winters.\"\n\nBefore my own time there was up I had learned to know what that meant.\nYet I had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural\ndelivery, when communication was easy between the scattered mountain\nvillages, and the bigger towns in the valleys, such as Bettsbridge and\nShadd's Falls, had libraries, theatres and Y. M. C. A. halls to which\nthe youth of the hills could descend for recreation. But when winter\nshut down on Starkfield and the village lay under a sheet of snow\nperpetually renewed from the pale skies, I began to see what life\nthere--or rather its negation--must have been in Ethan Frome's young\nmanhood.\n\nI had been sent up by my employers on a job connected with the big\npower-house at Corbury Junction, and a long-drawn carpenters' strike\nhad so delayed the work that I found myself anchored at Starkfield--the\nnearest habitable spot--for the best part of the winter. I chafed at\nfirst, and then, under the hypnotising effect of routine, gradually\nbegan to find a grim satisfaction in the life. During the early part of\nmy stay I had been struck by the contrast between the vitality of\nthe climate and the deadness of the community. Day by day, after the\nDecember snows were over, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents\nof light and air on the white landscape, which gave them back in an\nintenser glitter. One would have supposed that such an atmosphere must\nquicken the emotions as well as the blood; but it seemed to produce\nno change except that of retarding still more the sluggish pulse of\nStarkfield. When I had been there a little longer, and had seen this\nphase of crystal clearness followed by long stretches of sunless cold;\nwhen the storms of February had pitched their white tents about the\ndevoted village and the wild cavalry of March winds had charged down to\ntheir support; I began to understand why Starkfield emerged from its\nsix months' siege like a starved garrison capitulating without quarter.\nTwenty years earlier the means of resistance must have been far fewer,\nand the enemy in command of almost all the lines of access between the\nbeleaguered villages; and, considering these things, I felt the sinister\nforce of Harmon's phrase: \"Most of the smart ones get away.\" But if that\nwere the case, how could any combination of obstacles have hindered the\nflight of a man like Ethan Frome?\n\nDuring my stay at Starkfield I lodged with a middle-aged widow\ncolloquially known as Mrs. Ned Hale. Mrs. Hale's father had been the\nvillage lawyer of the previous generation, and \"lawyer Varnum's house,\"\nwhere my landlady still lived with her mother, was the most considerable\nmansion in the village. It stood at one end of the main street, its\nclassic portico and small-paned windows looking down a flagged path\nbetween Norway spruces to the slim white steeple of the Congregational\nchurch. It was clear that the Varnum fortunes were at the ebb, but the\ntwo women did what they could to preserve a decent dignity; and Mrs.\nHale, in particular, had a certain wan refinement not out of keeping\nwith her pale old-fashioned house.\n\nIn the \"best parlour,\" with its black horse-hair and mahogany weakly\nilluminated by a gurgling Carcel lamp, I listened every evening to\nanother and more delicately shaded version of the Starkfield chronicle.\nIt was not that Mrs. Ned Hale felt, or affected, any social superiority\nto the people about her; it was only that the accident of a finer\nsensibility and a little more education had put just enough distance\nbetween herself and her neighbours to enable her to judge them with\ndetachment. She was not unwilling to exercise this faculty, and I had\ngreat hopes of getting from her the missing facts of Ethan Frome's\nstory, or rather such a key to his character as should co-ordinate the\nfacts I knew. Her mind was a store-house of innocuous anecdote and any\nquestion about her acquaintances brought forth a volume of detail; but\non the subject of Ethan Frome I found her unexpectedly reticent. There\nwas no hint of disapproval in her reserve; I merely felt in her an\ninsurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low \"Yes, I\nknew them both... it was awful...\" seeming to be the utmost concession\nthat her distress could make to my curiosity.\n\nSo marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation\ndid it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, I put the case\nanew to my village oracle, Harmon Gow; but got for my pains only an\nuncomprehending grunt.\n\n\"Ruth Varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it,\nshe was the first one to see 'em after they was picked up. It happened\nright below lawyer Varnum's, down at the bend of the Corbury road, just\nround about the time that Ruth got engaged to Ned Hale. The young folks\nwas all friends, and I guess she just can't bear to talk about it. She's\nhad troubles enough of her own.\"\n\nAll the dwellers in Starkfield, as in more notable communities, had had\ntroubles enough of their own to make them comparatively indifferent to\nthose of their neighbours; and though all conceded that Ethan Frome's\nhad been beyond the common measure, no one gave me an explanation of the\nlook in his face which, as I persisted in thinking, neither poverty\nnor physical suffering could have put there. Nevertheless, I might have\ncontented myself with the story pieced together from these hints had\nit not been for the provocation of Mrs. Hale's silence, and--a little\nlater--for the accident of personal contact with the man.\n\nOn my arrival at Starkfield, Denis Eady, the rich Irish grocer, who was\nthe proprietor of Starkfield's nearest approach to a livery stable, had\nentered into an agreement to send me over daily to Corbury Flats, where\nI had to pick up my train for the Junction. But about the middle of the\nwinter Eady's horses fell ill of a local epidemic. The illness spread\nto the other Starkfield stables and for a day or two I was put to it to\nfind a means of transport. Then Harmon Gow suggested that Ethan Frome's\nbay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive me\nover.\n\nI stared at the suggestion. \"Ethan Frome? But I've never even spoken to\nhim. Why on earth should he put himself out for me?\"\n\nHarmon's answer surprised me still more. \"I don't know as he would; but\nI know he wouldn't be sorry to earn a dollar.\"\n\nI had been told that Frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the arid\nacres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his household through\nthe winter; but I had not supposed him to be in such want as Harmon's\nwords implied, and I expressed my wonder.\n\n\"Well, matters ain't gone any too well with him,\" Harmon said. \"When a\nman's been setting round like a hulk for twenty years or more, seeing\nthings that want doing, it eats inter him, and he loses his grit. That\nFrome farm was always 'bout as bare's a milkpan when the cat's been\nround; and you know what one of them old water-mills is wuth nowadays.\nWhen Ethan could sweat over 'em both from sunup to dark he kinder choked\na living out of 'em; but his folks ate up most everything, even then,\nand I don't see how he makes out now. Fust his father got a kick, out\nhaying, and went soft in the brain, and gave away money like Bible texts\nafore he died. Then his mother got queer and dragged along for years as\nweak as a baby; and his wife Zeena, she's always been the greatest hand\nat doctoring in the county. Sickness and trouble: that's what Ethan's\nhad his plate full up with, ever since the very first helping.\"\n\nThe next morning, when I looked out, I saw the hollow-backed bay between\nthe Varnum spruces, and Ethan Frome, throwing back his worn bearskin,\nmade room for me in the sleigh at his side. After that, for a week, he\ndrove me over every morning to Corbury Flats, and on my return in the\nafternoon met me again and carried me back through the icy night to\nStarkfield. The distance each way was barely three miles, but the old\nbay's pace was slow, and even with firm snow under the runners we were\nnearly an hour on the way. Ethan Frome drove in silence, the reins\nloosely held in his left hand, his brown seamed profile, under the\nhelmet-like peak of the cap, relieved against the banks of snow like the\nbronze image of a hero. He never turned his face to mine, or\nanswered, except in monosyllables, the questions I put, or such slight\npleasantries as I ventured. He seemed a part of the mute melancholy\nlandscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm\nand sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing\nunfriendly in his silence. I simply felt that he lived in a depth of\nmoral isolation too remote for casual access, and I had the sense that\nhis loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragic\nas I guessed that to be, but had in it, as Harmon Gow had hinted, the\nprofound accumulated cold of many Starkfield winters.\n\nOnly once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment;\nand the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more. Once I\nhappened to speak of an engineering job I had been on the previous year\nin Florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about us\nand that in which I had found myself the year before; and to my surprise\nFrome said suddenly: \"Yes: I was down there once, and for a good while\nafterward I could call up the sight of it in winter. But now it's all\nsnowed under.\"\n\nHe said no more, and I had to guess the rest from the inflection of his\nvoice and his sharp relapse into silence.\n\nAnother day, on getting into my train at the Flats, I missed a volume\nof popular science--I think it was on some recent discoveries in\nbio-chemistry--which I had carried with me to read on the way. I thought\nno more about it till I got into the sleigh again that evening, and saw\nthe book in Frome's hand.\n\n\"I found it after you were gone,\" he said.\n\nI put the volume into my pocket and we dropped back into our usual\nsilence; but as we began to crawl up the long hill from Corbury Flats to\nthe Starkfield ridge I became aware in the dusk that he had turned his\nface to mine.\n\n\"There are things in that book that I didn't know the first word about,\"\nhe said.\n\nI wondered less at his words than at the queer note of resentment in\nhis voice. He was evidently surprised and slightly aggrieved at his own\nignorance.\n\n\"Does that sort of thing interest you?\" I asked.\n\n\"It used to.\"\n\n\"There are one or two rather new things in the book: there have been\nsome big strides lately in that particular line of research.\" I waited\na moment for an answer that did not come; then I said: \"If you'd like to\nlook the book through I'd be glad to leave it with you.\"\n\nHe hesitated, and I had the impression that he felt himself about to\nyield to a stealing tide of inertia; then, \"Thank you--I'll take it,\" he\nanswered shortly.\n\nI hoped that this incident might set up some more direct communication\nbetween us. Frome was so simple and straightforward that I was sure his\ncuriosity about the book was based on a genuine interest in its subject.\nSuch tastes and acquirements in a man of his condition made the contrast\nmore poignant between his outer situation and his inner needs, and I\nhoped that the chance of giving expression to the latter might at least\nunseal his lips. But something in his past history, or in his present\nway of living, had apparently driven him too deeply into himself for any\ncasual impulse to draw him back to his kind. At our next meeting he made\nno allusion to the book, and our intercourse seemed fated to remain as\nnegative and one-sided as if there had been no break in his reserve.\n\nFrome had been driving me over to the Flats for about a week when one\nmorning I looked out of my window into a thick snow-fall. The height of\nthe white waves massed against the garden-fence and along the wall of\nthe church showed that the storm must have been going on all night,\nand that the drifts were likely to be heavy in the open. I thought\nit probable that my train would be delayed; but I had to be at the\npower-house for an hour or two that afternoon, and I decided, if Frome\nturned up, to push through to the Flats and wait there till my train\ncame in. I don't know why I put it in the conditional, however, for I\nnever doubted that Frome would appear. He was not the kind of man to be\nturned from his business by any commotion of the elements; and at\nthe appointed hour his sleigh glided up through the snow like a\nstage-apparition behind thickening veils of gauze.\n\nI was getting to know him too well to express either wonder or gratitude\nat his keeping his appointment; but I exclaimed in surprise as I saw him\nturn his horse in a direction opposite to that of the Corbury road.\n\n\"The railroad's blocked by a freight-train that got stuck in a drift\nbelow the Flats,\" he explained, as we jogged off into the stinging\nwhiteness.\n\n\"But look here--where are you taking me, then?\"\n\n\"Straight to the Junction, by the shortest way,\" he answered, pointing\nup School House Hill with his whip.\n\n\"To the Junction--in this storm? Why, it's a good ten miles!\"\n\n\"The bay'll do it if you give him time. You said you had some business\nthere this afternoon. I'll see you get there.\"\n\nHe said it so quietly that I could only answer: \"You're doing me the\nbiggest kind of a favour.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" he rejoined.\n\nAbreast of the schoolhouse the road forked, and we dipped down a lane\nto the left, between hemlock boughs bent inward to their trunks by the\nweight of the snow. I had often walked that way on Sundays, and knew\nthat the solitary roof showing through bare branches near the bottom of\nthe hill was that of Frome's saw-mill. It looked exanimate enough, with\nits idle wheel looming above the black stream dashed with yellow-white\nspume, and its cluster of sheds sagging under their white load. Frome\ndid not even turn his head as we drove by, and still in silence we began\nto mount the next slope. About a mile farther, on a road I had never\ntravelled, we came to an orchard of starved apple-trees writhing over\na hillside among outcroppings of slate that nuzzled up through the snow\nlike animals pushing out their noses to breathe. Beyond the orchard\nlay a field or two, their boundaries lost under drifts; and above the\nfields, huddled against the white immensities of land and sky, one of\nthose lonely New England farm-houses that make the landscape lonelier.\n\n\"That's my place,\" said Frome, with a sideway jerk of his lame elbow;\nand in the distress and oppression of the scene I did not know what to\nanswer. The snow had ceased, and a flash of watery sunlight exposed the\nhouse on the slope above us in all its plaintive ugliness. The black\nwraith of a deciduous creeper flapped from the porch, and the thin\nwooden walls, under their worn coat of paint, seemed to shiver in the\nwind that had risen with the ceasing of the snow.\n\n\"The house was bigger in my father's time: I had to take down the 'L,'\na while back,\" Frome continued, checking with a twitch of the left rein\nthe bay's evident intention of turning in through the broken-down gate.\n\nI saw then that the unusually forlorn and stunted look of the house was\npartly due to the loss of what is known in New England as the \"L\":\nthat long deep-roofed adjunct usually built at right angles to the main\nhouse, and connecting it, by way of storerooms and tool-house, with the\nwood-shed and cow-barn. Whether because of its symbolic sense, the image\nit presents of a life linked with the soil, and enclosing in itself the\nchief sources of warmth and nourishment, or whether merely because\nof the consolatory thought that it enables the dwellers in that harsh\nclimate to get to their morning's work without facing the weather, it\nis certain that the \"L\" rather than the house itself seems to be the\ncentre, the actual hearth-stone of the New England farm. Perhaps this\nconnection of ideas, which had often occurred to me in my rambles about\nStarkfield, caused me to hear a wistful note in Frome's words, and to\nsee in the diminished dwelling the image of his own shrunken body.\n\n\"We're kinder side-tracked here now,\" he added, \"but there was\nconsiderable passing before the railroad was carried through to the\nFlats.\" He roused the lagging bay with another twitch; then, as if the\nmere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence for\nany farther pretence of reserve, he went on slowly: \"I've always set\ndown the worst of mother's trouble to that. When she got the rheumatism\nso bad she couldn't move around she used to sit up there and watch the\nroad by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending the\nBettsbridge pike after the floods, and Harmon Gow had to bring his stage\nround this way, she picked up so that she used to get down to the gate\nmost days to see him. But after the trains begun running nobody ever\ncome by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her head\nwhat had happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died.\"\n\nAs we turned into the Corbury road the snow began to fall again, cutting\noff our last glimpse of the house; and Frome's silence fell with it,\nletting down between us the old veil of reticence. This time the wind\ndid not cease with the return of the snow. Instead, it sprang up to\na gale which now and then, from a tattered sky, flung pale sweeps of\nsunlight over a landscape chaotically tossed. But the bay was as good\nas Frome's word, and we pushed on to the Junction through the wild white\nscene.\n\nIn the afternoon the storm held off, and the clearness in the west\nseemed to my inexperienced eye the pledge of a fair evening. I finished\nmy business as quickly as possible, and we set out for Starkfield with\na good chance of getting there for supper. But at sunset the clouds\ngathered again, bringing an earlier night, and the snow began to fall\nstraight and steadily from a sky without wind, in a soft universal\ndiffusion more confusing than the gusts and eddies of the morning. It\nseemed to be a part of the thickening darkness, to be the winter night\nitself descending on us layer by layer.\n\nThe small ray of Frome's lantern was soon lost in this smothering\nmedium, in which even his sense of direction, and the bay's homing\ninstinct, finally ceased to serve us. Two or three times some ghostly\nlandmark sprang up to warn us that we were astray, and then was sucked\nback into the mist; and when we finally regained our road the old horse\nbegan to show signs of exhaustion. I felt myself to blame for having\naccepted Frome's offer, and after a short discussion I persuaded him\nto let me get out of the sleigh and walk along through the snow at the\nbay's side. In this way we struggled on for another mile or two, and\nat last reached a point where Frome, peering into what seemed to me\nformless night, said: \"That's my gate down yonder.\"\n\nThe last stretch had been the hardest part of the way. The bitter cold\nand the heavy going had nearly knocked the wind out of me, and I could\nfeel the horse's side ticking like a clock under my hand.\n\n\"Look here, Frome,\" I began, \"there's no earthly use in your going any\nfarther--\" but he interrupted me: \"Nor you neither. There's been about\nenough of this for anybody.\"\n\nI understood that he was offering me a night's shelter at the farm, and\nwithout answering I turned into the gate at his side, and followed him\nto the barn, where I helped him to unharness and bed down the tired\nhorse. When this was done he unhooked the lantern from the sleigh,\nstepped out again into the night, and called to me over his shoulder:\n\"This way.\"\n\nFar off above us a square of light trembled through the screen of snow.\nStaggering along in Frome's wake I floundered toward it, and in the\ndarkness almost fell into one of the deep drifts against the front of\nthe house. Frome scrambled up the slippery steps of the porch, digging\na way through the snow with his heavily booted foot. Then he lifted his\nlantern, found the latch, and led the way into the house. I went\nafter him into a low unlit passage, at the back of which a ladder-like\nstaircase rose into obscurity. On our right a line of light marked the\ndoor of the room which had sent its ray across the night; and behind the\ndoor I heard a woman's voice droning querulously.\n\nFrome stamped on the worn oil-cloth to shake the snow from his boots,\nand set down his lantern on a kitchen chair which was the only piece of\nfurniture in the hall. Then he opened the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said; and as he spoke the droning voice grew still...\n\nIt was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put\ntogether this vision of his story.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe village lay under two feet of snow, with drifts at the windy\ncorners. In a sky of iron the points of the Dipper hung like icicles\nand Orion flashed his cold fires. The moon had set, but the night was\nso transparent that the white house-fronts between the elms looked gray\nagainst the snow, clumps of bushes made black stains on it, and the\nbasement windows of the church sent shafts of yellow light far across\nthe endless undulations.\n\nYoung Ethan Frome walked at a quick pace along the deserted street, past\nthe bank and Michael Eady's new brick store and Lawyer Varnum's house\nwith the two black Norway spruces at the gate. Opposite the Varnum gate,\nwhere the road fell away toward the Corbury valley, the church reared\nits slim white steeple and narrow peristyle. As the young man walked\ntoward it the upper windows drew a black arcade along the side wall of\nthe building, but from the lower openings, on the side where the ground\nsloped steeply down to the Corbury road, the light shot its long bars,\nilluminating many fresh furrows in the track leading to the basement\ndoor, and showing, under an adjoining shed, a line of sleighs with\nheavily blanketed horses.\n\nThe night was perfectly still, and the air so dry and pure that it gave\nlittle sensation of cold. The effect produced on Frome was rather of\na complete absence of atmosphere, as though nothing less tenuous than\nether intervened between the white earth under his feet and the metallic\ndome overhead. \"It's like being in an exhausted receiver,\" he\nthought. Four or five years earlier he had taken a year's course at a\ntechnological college at Worcester, and dabbled in the laboratory with\na friendly professor of physics; and the images supplied by that\nexperience still cropped up, at unexpected moments, through the totally\ndifferent associations of thought in which he had since been living. His\nfather's death, and the misfortunes following it, had put a premature\nend to Ethan's studies; but though they had not gone far enough to be\nof much practical use they had fed his fancy and made him aware of huge\ncloudy meanings behind the daily face of things.\n\nAs he strode along through the snow the sense of such meanings glowed in\nhis brain and mingled with the bodily flush produced by his sharp tramp.\nAt the end of the village he paused before the darkened front of the\nchurch. He stood there a moment, breathing quickly, and looking up and\ndown the street, in which not another figure moved. The pitch of\nthe Corbury road, below lawyer Varnum's spruces, was the favourite\ncoasting-ground of Starkfield, and on clear evenings the church corner\nrang till late with the shouts of the coasters; but to-night not a sled\ndarkened the whiteness of the long declivity. The hush of midnight lay\non the village, and all its waking life was gathered behind the church\nwindows, from which strains of dance-music flowed with the broad bands\nof yellow light.\n\nThe young man, skirting the side of the building, went down the slope\ntoward the basement door. To keep out of range of the revealing rays\nfrom within he made a circuit through the untrodden snow and gradually\napproached the farther angle of the basement wall. Thence, still hugging\nthe shadow, he edged his way cautiously forward to the nearest window,\nholding back his straight spare body and craning his neck till he got a\nglimpse of the room.\n\nSeen thus, from the pure and frosty darkness in which he stood, it\nseemed to be seething in a mist of heat. The metal reflectors of the\ngas-jets sent crude waves of light against the whitewashed walls, and\nthe iron flanks of the stove at the end of the hall looked as though\nthey were heaving with volcanic fires. The floor was thronged with\ngirls and young men. Down the side wall facing the window stood a row of\nkitchen chairs from which the older women had just risen. By this time\nthe music had stopped, and the musicians--a fiddler, and the young lady\nwho played the harmonium on Sundays--were hastily refreshing themselves\nat one corner of the supper-table which aligned its devastated\npie-dishes and ice-cream saucers on the platform at the end of the hall.\nThe guests were preparing to leave, and the tide had already set toward\nthe passage where coats and wraps were hung, when a young man with a\nsprightly foot and a shock of black hair shot into the middle of\nthe floor and clapped his hands. The signal took instant effect.\nThe musicians hurried to their instruments, the dancers--some already\nhalf-muffled for departure--fell into line down each side of the room,\nthe older spectators slipped back to their chairs, and the lively young\nman, after diving about here and there in the throng, drew forth a girl\nwho had already wound a cherry-coloured \"fascinator\" about her head,\nand, leading her up to the end of the floor, whirled her down its length\nto the bounding tune of a Virginia reel.\n\nFrome's heart was beating fast. He had been straining for a glimpse\nof the dark head under the cherry-coloured scarf and it vexed him that\nanother eye should have been quicker than his. The leader of the reel,\nwho looked as if he had Irish blood in his veins, danced well, and his\npartner caught his fire. As she passed down the line, her light figure\nswinging from hand to hand in circles of increasing swiftness, the scarf\nflew off her head and stood out behind her shoulders, and Frome, at each\nturn, caught sight of her laughing panting lips, the cloud of dark hair\nabout her forehead, and the dark eyes which seemed the only fixed points\nin a maze of flying lines.\n\nThe dancers were going faster and faster, and the musicians, to keep\nup with them, belaboured their instruments like jockeys lashing their\nmounts on the home-stretch; yet it seemed to the young man at the window\nthat the reel would never end. Now and then he turned his eyes from the\ngirl's face to that of her partner, which, in the exhilaration of the\ndance, had taken on a look of almost impudent ownership. Denis Eady was\nthe son of Michael Eady, the ambitious Irish grocer, whose suppleness\nand effrontery had given Starkfield its first notion of \"smart\" business\nmethods, and whose new brick store testified to the success of the\nattempt. His son seemed likely to follow in his steps, and was meanwhile\napplying the same arts to the conquest of the Starkfield maidenhood.\nHitherto Ethan Frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but\nnow he positively invited a horse-whipping. It was strange that the\ngirl did not seem aware of it: that she could lift her rapt face to her\ndancer's, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel the\noffence of his look and touch.\n\nFrome was in the habit of walking into Starkfield to fetch home his\nwife's cousin, Mattie Silver, on the rare evenings when some chance of\namusement drew her to the village. It was his wife who had suggested,\nwhen the girl came to live with them, that such opportunities should be\nput in her way. Mattie Silver came from Stamford, and when she entered\nthe Fromes' household to act as her cousin Zeena's aid it was thought\nbest, as she came without pay, not to let her feel too sharp a contrast\nbetween the life she had left and the isolation of a Starkfield farm.\nBut for this--as Frome sardonically reflected--it would hardly have\noccurred to Zeena to take any thought for the girl's amusement.\n\nWhen his wife first proposed that they should give Mattie an occasional\nevening out he had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two miles\nto the village and back after his hard day on the farm; but not long\nafterward he had reached the point of wishing that Starkfield might give\nall its nights to revelry.\n\nMattie Silver had lived under his roof for a year, and from early\nmorning till they met at supper he had frequent chances of seeing her;\nbut no moments in her company were comparable to those when, her arm in\nhis, and her light step flying to keep time with his long stride, they\nwalked back through the night to the farm. He had taken to the girl from\nthe first day, when he had driven over to the Flats to meet her, and\nshe had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out, \"You must be\nEthan!\" as she jumped down with her bundles, while he reflected, looking\nover her slight person: \"She don't look much on housework, but she ain't\na fretter, anyhow.\" But it was not only that the coming to his house of\na bit of hopeful young life was like the lighting of a fire on a cold\nhearth. The girl was more than the bright serviceable creature he had\nthought her. She had an eye to see and an ear to hear: he could show her\nthings and tell her things, and taste the bliss of feeling that all he\nimparted left long reverberations and echoes he could wake at will.\n\nIt was during their night walks back to the farm that he felt most\nintensely the sweetness of this communion. He had always been more\nsensitive than the people about him to the appeal of natural beauty. His\nunfinished studies had given form to this sensibility and even in his\nunhappiest moments field and sky spoke to him with a deep and powerful\npersuasion. But hitherto the emotion had remained in him as a silent\nache, veiling with sadness the beauty that evoked it. He did not even\nknow whether any one else in the world felt as he did, or whether he\nwas the sole victim of this mournful privilege. Then he learned that\none other spirit had trembled with the same touch of wonder: that at his\nside, living under his roof and eating his bread, was a creature to whom\nhe could say: \"That's Orion down yonder; the big fellow to the right is\nAldebaran, and the bunch of little ones--like bees swarming--they're the\nPleiades...\" or whom he could hold entranced before a ledge of granite\nthrusting up through the fern while he unrolled the huge panorama of the\nice age, and the long dim stretches of succeeding time. The fact that\nadmiration for his learning mingled with Mattie's wonder at what he\ntaught was not the least part of his pleasure. And there were other\nsensations, less definable but more exquisite, which drew them together\nwith a shock of silent joy: the cold red of sunset behind winter\nhills, the flight of cloud-flocks over slopes of golden stubble, or the\nintensely blue shadows of hemlocks on sunlit snow. When she said to him\nonce: \"It looks just as if it was painted!\" it seemed to Ethan that the\nart of definition could go no farther, and that words had at last been\nfound to utter his secret soul....\n\nAs he stood in the darkness outside the church these memories came back\nwith the poignancy of vanished things. Watching Mattie whirl down the\nfloor from hand to hand he wondered how he could ever have thought\nthat his dull talk interested her. To him, who was never gay but in her\npresence, her gaiety seemed plain proof of indifference. The face she\nlifted to her dancers was the same which, when she saw him, always\nlooked like a window that has caught the sunset. He even noticed two or\nthree gestures which, in his fatuity, he had thought she kept for him:\na way of throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her\nlaugh before she let it out, and a trick of sinking her lids slowly when\nanything charmed or moved her.\n\nThe sight made him unhappy, and his unhappiness roused his latent fears.\nHis wife had never shown any jealousy of Mattie, but of late she had\ngrumbled increasingly over the house-work and found oblique ways of\nattracting attention to the girl's inefficiency. Zeena had always been\nwhat Starkfield called \"sickly,\" and Frome had to admit that, if she\nwere as ailing as she believed, she needed the help of a stronger arm\nthan the one which lay so lightly in his during the night walks to the\nfarm. Mattie had no natural turn for housekeeping, and her training had\ndone nothing to remedy the defect. She was quick to learn, but forgetful\nand dreamy, and not disposed to take the matter seriously. Ethan had\nan idea that if she were to marry a man she was fond of the dormant\ninstinct would wake, and her pies and biscuits become the pride of the\ncounty; but domesticity in the abstract did not interest her. At first\nshe was so awkward that he could not help laughing at her; but she\nlaughed with him and that made them better friends. He did his best to\nsupplement her unskilled efforts, getting up earlier than usual to light\nthe kitchen fire, carrying in the wood overnight, and neglecting the\nmill for the farm that he might help her about the house during the day.\nHe even crept down on Saturday nights to scrub the kitchen floor after\nthe women had gone to bed; and Zeena, one day, had surprised him at the\nchurn and had turned away silently, with one of her queer looks.\n\nOf late there had been other signs of her disfavour, as intangible but\nmore disquieting. One cold winter morning, as he dressed in the dark,\nhis candle flickering in the draught of the ill-fitting window, he had\nheard her speak from the bed behind him.\n\n\"The doctor don't want I should be left without anybody to do for me,\"\nshe said in her flat whine.\n\nHe had supposed her to be asleep, and the sound of her voice had\nstartled him, though she was given to abrupt explosions of speech after\nlong intervals of secretive silence.\n\nHe turned and looked at her where she lay indistinctly outlined under\nthe dark calico quilt, her high-boned face taking a grayish tinge from\nthe whiteness of the pillow.\n\n\"Nobody to do for you?\" he repeated.\n\n\"If you say you can't afford a hired girl when Mattie goes.\"\n\nFrome turned away again, and taking up his razor stooped to catch the\nreflection of his stretched cheek in the blotched looking-glass above\nthe wash-stand.\n\n\"Why on earth should Mattie go?\"\n\n\"Well, when she gets married, I mean,\" his wife's drawl came from behind\nhim.\n\n\"Oh, she'd never leave us as long as you needed her,\" he returned,\nscraping hard at his chin.\n\n\"I wouldn't ever have it said that I stood in the way of a poor girl\nlike Mattie marrying a smart fellow like Denis Eady,\" Zeena answered in\na tone of plaintive self-effacement.\n\nEthan, glaring at his face in the glass, threw his head back to draw\nthe razor from ear to chin. His hand was steady, but the attitude was an\nexcuse for not making an immediate reply.\n\n\"And the doctor don't want I should be left without anybody,\" Zeena\ncontinued. \"He wanted I should speak to you about a girl he's heard\nabout, that might come--\"\n\nEthan laid down the razor and straightened himself with a laugh.\n\n\"Denis Eady! If that's all, I guess there's no such hurry to look round\nfor a girl.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to talk to you about it,\" said Zeena obstinately.\n\nHe was getting into his clothes in fumbling haste. \"All right. But I\nhaven't got the time now; I'm late as it is,\" he returned, holding his\nold silver turnip-watch to the candle.\n\nZeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him in silence\nwhile he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his arms\ninto his coat; but as he went toward the door she said, suddenly and\nincisively: \"I guess you're always late, now you shave every morning.\"\n\nThat thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations about\nDenis Eady. It was a fact that since Mattie Silver's coming he had taken\nto shaving every day; but his wife always seemed to be asleep when he\nleft her side in the winter darkness, and he had stupidly assumed that\nshe would not notice any change in his appearance. Once or twice in the\npast he had been faintly disquieted by Zenobia's way of letting things\nhappen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, in\na casual phrase, revealing that she had all along taken her notes and\ndrawn her inferences. Of late, however, there had been no room in his\nthoughts for such vague apprehensions. Zeena herself, from an oppressive\nreality, had faded into an insubstantial shade. All his life was lived\nin the sight and sound of Mattie Silver, and he could no longer conceive\nof its being otherwise. But now, as he stood outside the church, and saw\nMattie spinning down the floor with Denis Eady, a throng of disregarded\nhints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain....\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nAs the dancers poured out of the hall Frome, drawing back behind the\nprojecting storm-door, watched the segregation of the grotesquely\nmuffled groups, in which a moving lantern ray now and then lit up a\nface flushed with food and dancing. The villagers, being afoot, were\nthe first to climb the slope to the main street, while the country\nneighbours packed themselves more slowly into the sleighs under the\nshed.\n\n\"Ain't you riding, Mattie?\" a woman's voice called back from the throng\nabout the shed, and Ethan's heart gave a jump. From where he stood he\ncould not see the persons coming out of the hall till they had advanced\na few steps beyond the wooden sides of the storm-door; but through its\ncracks he heard a clear voice answer: \"Mercy no! Not on such a night.\"\n\nShe was there, then, close to him, only a thin board between. In another\nmoment she would step forth into the night, and his eyes, accustomed\nto the obscurity, would discern her as clearly as though she stood in\ndaylight. A wave of shyness pulled him back into the dark angle of the\nwall, and he stood there in silence instead of making his presence known\nto her. It had been one of the wonders of their intercourse that from\nthe first, she, the quicker, finer, more expressive, instead of crushing\nhim by the contrast, had given him something of her own ease and\nfreedom; but now he felt as heavy and loutish as in his student days,\nwhen he had tried to \"jolly\" the Worcester girls at a picnic.\n\nHe hung back, and she came out alone and paused within a few yards of\nhim. She was almost the last to leave the hall, and she stood looking\nuncertainly about her as if wondering why he did not show himself.\nThen a man's figure approached, coming so close to her that under their\nformless wrappings they seemed merged in one dim outline.\n\n\"Gentleman friend gone back on you? Say, Matt, that's tough! No, I\nwouldn't be mean enough to tell the other girls. I ain't as low-down as\nthat.\" (How Frome hated his cheap banter!) \"But look at here, ain't it\nlucky I got the old man's cutter down there waiting for us?\"\n\nFrome heard the girl's voice, gaily incredulous: \"What on earth's your\nfather's cutter doin' down there?\"\n\n\"Why, waiting for me to take a ride. I got the roan colt too. I kinder\nknew I'd want to take a ride to-night,\" Eady, in his triumph, tried to\nput a sentimental note into his bragging voice.\n\nThe girl seemed to waver, and Frome saw her twirl the end of her scarf\nirresolutely about her fingers. Not for the world would he have made\na sign to her, though it seemed to him that his life hung on her next\ngesture.\n\n\"Hold on a minute while I unhitch the colt,\" Denis called to her,\nspringing toward the shed.\n\nShe stood perfectly still, looking after him, in an attitude of tranquil\nexpectancy torturing to the hidden watcher. Frome noticed that she no\nlonger turned her head from side to side, as though peering through the\nnight for another figure. She let Denis Eady lead out the horse, climb\ninto the cutter and fling back the bearskin to make room for her at his\nside; then, with a swift motion of flight, she turned about and darted\nup the slope toward the front of the church.\n\n\"Good-bye! Hope you'll have a lovely ride!\" she called back to him over\nher shoulder.\n\nDenis laughed, and gave the horse a cut that brought him quickly abreast\nof her retreating figure.\n\n\"Come along! Get in quick! It's as slippery as thunder on this turn,\" he\ncried, leaning over to reach out a hand to her.\n\nShe laughed back at him: \"Good-night! I'm not getting in.\"\n\nBy this time they had passed beyond Frome's earshot and he could only\nfollow the shadowy pantomime of their silhouettes as they continued\nto move along the crest of the slope above him. He saw Eady, after a\nmoment, jump from the cutter and go toward the girl with the reins over\none arm. The other he tried to slip through hers; but she eluded him\nnimbly, and Frome's heart, which had swung out over a black void,\ntrembled back to safety. A moment later he heard the jingle of departing\nsleigh bells and discerned a figure advancing alone toward the empty\nexpanse of snow before the church.\n\nIn the black shade of the Varnum spruces he caught up with her and she\nturned with a quick \"Oh!\"\n\n\"Think I'd forgotten you, Matt?\" he asked with sheepish glee.\n\nShe answered seriously: \"I thought maybe you couldn't come back for me.\"\n\n\"Couldn't? What on earth could stop me?\"\n\n\"I knew Zeena wasn't feeling any too good to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, she's in bed long ago.\" He paused, a question struggling in him.\n\"Then you meant to walk home all alone?\"\n\n\"Oh, I ain't afraid!\" she laughed.\n\nThey stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world\nglimmering about them wide and grey under the stars. He brought his\nquestion out.\n\n\"If you thought I hadn't come, why didn't you ride back with Denis\nEady?\"\n\n\"Why, where were you? How did you know? I never saw you!\"\n\nHer wonder and his laughter ran together like spring rills in a thaw.\nEthan had the sense of having done something arch and ingenious. To\nprolong the effect he groped for a dazzling phrase, and brought out, in\na growl of rapture: \"Come along.\"\n\nHe slipped an arm through hers, as Eady had done, and fancied it was\nfaintly pressed against her side, but neither of them moved. It was so\ndark under the spruces that he could barely see the shape of her head\nbeside his shoulder. He longed to stoop his cheek and rub it against\nher scarf. He would have liked to stand there with her all night in the\nblackness. She moved forward a step or two and then paused again above\nthe dip of the Corbury road. Its icy slope, scored by innumerable\nrunners, looked like a mirror scratched by travellers at an inn.\n\n\"There was a whole lot of them coasting before the moon set,\" she said.\n\n\"Would you like to come in and coast with them some night?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, would you, Ethan? It would be lovely!\"\n\n\"We'll come to-morrow if there's a moon.\"\n\nShe lingered, pressing closer to his side. \"Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum\ncame just as near running into the big elm at the bottom. We were all\nsure they were killed.\" Her shiver ran down his arm. \"Wouldn't it have\nbeen too awful? They're so happy!\"\n\n\"Oh, Ned ain't much at steering. I guess I can take you down all right!\"\nhe said disdainfully.\n\nHe was aware that he was \"talking big,\" like Denis Eady; but his\nreaction of joy had unsteadied him, and the inflection with which she\nhad said of the engaged couple \"They're so happy!\" made the words sound\nas if she had been thinking of herself and him.\n\n\"The elm is dangerous, though. It ought to be cut down,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Would you be afraid of it, with me?\"\n\n\"I told you I ain't the kind to be afraid\" she tossed back, almost\nindifferently; and suddenly she began to walk on with a rapid step.\n\nThese alterations of mood were the despair and joy of Ethan Frome. The\nmotions of her mind were as incalculable as the flit of a bird in the\nbranches. The fact that he had no right to show his feelings, and thus\nprovoke the expression of hers, made him attach a fantastic importance\nto every change in her look and tone. Now he thought she understood him,\nand feared; now he was sure she did not, and despaired. To-night the\npressure of accumulated misgivings sent the scale drooping toward\ndespair, and her indifference was the more chilling after the flush of\njoy into which she had plunged him by dismissing Denis Eady. He mounted\nSchool House Hill at her side and walked on in silence till they\nreached the lane leading to the saw-mill; then the need of some definite\nassurance grew too strong for him.\n\n\"You'd have found me right off if you hadn't gone back to have that last\nreel with Denis,\" he brought out awkwardly. He could not pronounce the\nname without a stiffening of the muscles of his throat.\n\n\"Why, Ethan, how could I tell you were there?\"\n\n\"I suppose what folks say is true,\" he jerked out at her, instead of\nanswering.\n\nShe stopped short, and he felt, in the darkness, that her face was\nlifted quickly to his. \"Why, what do folks say?\"\n\n\"It's natural enough you should be leaving us\" he floundered on,\nfollowing his thought.\n\n\"Is that what they say?\" she mocked back at him; then, with a sudden\ndrop of her sweet treble: \"You mean that Zeena--ain't suited with me any\nmore?\" she faltered.\n\nTheir arms had slipped apart and they stood motionless, each seeking to\ndistinguish the other's face.\n\n\"I know I ain't anything like as smart as I ought to be,\" she went on,\nwhile he vainly struggled for expression. \"There's lots of things a\nhired girl could do that come awkward to me still--and I haven't got much\nstrength in my arms. But if she'd only tell me I'd try. You know she\nhardly ever says anything, and sometimes I can see she ain't suited,\nand yet I don't know why.\" She turned on him with a sudden flash of\nindignation. \"You'd ought to tell me, Ethan Frome--you'd ought to! Unless\nyou want me to go too--\"\n\nUnless he wanted her to go too! The cry was balm to his raw wound. The\niron heavens seemed to melt and rain down sweetness. Again he struggled\nfor the all-expressive word, and again, his arm in hers, found only a\ndeep \"Come along.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence through the blackness of the hemlock-shaded\nlane, where Ethan's sawmill gloomed through the night, and out again\ninto the comparative clearness of the fields. On the farther side of the\nhemlock belt the open country rolled away before them grey and lonely\nunder the stars. Sometimes their way led them under the shade of an\noverhanging bank or through the thin obscurity of a clump of leafless\ntrees. Here and there a farmhouse stood far back among the fields, mute\nand cold as a grave-stone. The night was so still that they heard the\nfrozen snow crackle under their feet. The crash of a loaded branch\nfalling far off in the woods reverberated like a musket-shot, and once a\nfox barked, and Mattie shrank closer to Ethan, and quickened her steps.\n\nAt length they sighted the group of larches at Ethan's gate, and as they\ndrew near it the sense that the walk was over brought back his words.\n\n\"Then you don't want to leave us, Matt?\"\n\nHe had to stoop his head to catch her stifled whisper: \"Where'd I go, if\nI did?\"\n\nThe answer sent a pang through him but the tone suffused him with joy.\nHe forgot what else he had meant to say and pressed her against him so\nclosely that he seemed to feel her warmth in his veins.\n\n\"You ain't crying are you, Matt?\"\n\n\"No, of course I'm not,\" she quavered.\n\nThey turned in at the gate and passed under the shaded knoll where,\nenclosed in a low fence, the Frome grave-stones slanted at crazy angles\nthrough the snow. Ethan looked at them curiously. For years that quiet\ncompany had mocked his restlessness, his desire for change and freedom.\n\"We never got away--how should you?\" seemed to be written on every\nheadstone; and whenever he went in or out of his gate he thought with a\nshiver: \"I shall just go on living here till I join them.\" But now all\ndesire for change had vanished, and the sight of the little enclosure\ngave him a warm sense of continuance and stability.\n\n\"I guess we'll never let you go, Matt,\" he whispered, as though even the\ndead, lovers once, must conspire with him to keep her; and brushing by\nthe graves, he thought: \"We'll always go on living here together, and\nsome day she'll lie there beside me.\"\n\nHe let the vision possess him as they climbed the hill to the house.\nHe was never so happy with her as when he abandoned himself to these\ndreams. Half-way up the slope Mattie stumbled against some unseen\nobstruction and clutched his sleeve to steady herself. The wave of\nwarmth that went through him was like the prolongation of his vision.\nFor the first time he stole his arm about her, and she did not resist.\nThey walked on as if they were floating on a summer stream.\n\nZeena always went to bed as soon as she had had her supper, and the\nshutterless windows of the house were dark. A dead cucumber-vine dangled\nfrom the porch like the crape streamer tied to the door for a death, and\nthe thought flashed through Ethan's brain: \"If it was there for Zeena--\"\nThen he had a distinct sight of his wife lying in their bedroom asleep,\nher mouth slightly open, her false teeth in a tumbler by the bed...\n\nThey walked around to the back of the house, between the rigid\ngooseberry bushes. It was Zeena's habit, when they came back late from\nthe village, to leave the key of the kitchen door under the mat. Ethan\nstood before the door, his head heavy with dreams, his arm still about\nMattie. \"Matt--\" he began, not knowing what he meant to say.\n\nShe slipped out of his hold without speaking, and he stooped down and\nfelt for the key.\n\n\"It's not there!\" he said, straightening himself with a start.\n\nThey strained their eyes at each other through the icy darkness. Such a\nthing had never happened before.\n\n\"Maybe she's forgotten it,\" Mattie said in a tremulous whisper; but both\nof them knew that it was not like Zeena to forget.\n\n\"It might have fallen off into the snow,\" Mattie continued, after a\npause during which they had stood intently listening.\n\n\"It must have been pushed off, then,\" he rejoined in the same tone.\nAnother wild thought tore through him. What if tramps had been\nthere--what if...\n\nAgain he listened, fancying he heard a distant sound in the house; then\nhe felt in his pocket for a match, and kneeling down, passed its light\nslowly over the rough edges of snow about the doorstep.\n\nHe was still kneeling when his eyes, on a level with the lower panel of\nthe door, caught a faint ray beneath it. Who could be stirring in that\nsilent house? He heard a step on the stairs, and again for an instant\nthe thought of tramps tore through him. Then the door opened and he saw\nhis wife.\n\nAgainst the dark background of the kitchen she stood up tall and\nangular, one hand drawing a quilted counterpane to her flat breast,\nwhile the other held a lamp. The light, on a level with her chin, drew\nout of the darkness her puckered throat and the projecting wrist of the\nhand that clutched the quilt, and deepened fantastically the hollows and\nprominences of her high-boned face under its ring of crimping-pins. To\nEthan, still in the rosy haze of his hour with Mattie, the sight came\nwith the intense precision of the last dream before waking. He felt as\nif he had never before known what his wife looked like.\n\nShe drew aside without speaking, and Mattie and Ethan passed into the\nkitchen, which had the deadly chill of a vault after the dry cold of the\nnight.\n\n\"Guess you forgot about us, Zeena,\" Ethan joked, stamping the snow from\nhis boots.\n\n\"No. I just felt so mean I couldn't sleep.\"\n\nMattie came forward, unwinding her wraps, the colour of the cherry scarf\nin her fresh lips and cheeks. \"I'm so sorry, Zeena! Isn't there anything\nI can do?\"\n\n\"No; there's nothing.\" Zeena turned away from her. \"You might 'a' shook\noff that snow outside,\" she said to her husband.\n\nShe walked out of the kitchen ahead of them and pausing in the hall\nraised the lamp at arm's-length, as if to light them up the stairs.\n\nEthan paused also, affecting to fumble for the peg on which he hung his\ncoat and cap. The doors of the two bedrooms faced each other across the\nnarrow upper landing, and to-night it was peculiarly repugnant to him\nthat Mattie should see him follow Zeena.\n\n\"I guess I won't come up yet awhile,\" he said, turning as if to go back\nto the kitchen.\n\nZeena stopped short and looked at him. \"For the land's sake--what you\ngoing to do down here?\"\n\n\"I've got the mill accounts to go over.\"\n\nShe continued to stare at him, the flame of the unshaded lamp bringing\nout with microscopic cruelty the fretful lines of her face.\n\n\"At this time o' night? You'll ketch your death. The fire's out long\nago.\"\n\nWithout answering he moved away toward the kitchen. As he did so his\nglance crossed Mattie's and he fancied that a fugitive warning gleamed\nthrough her lashes. The next moment they sank to her flushed cheeks and\nshe began to mount the stairs ahead of Zeena.\n\n\"That's so. It is powerful cold down here,\" Ethan assented; and with\nlowered head he went up in his wife's wake, and followed her across the\nthreshold of their room.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThere was some hauling to be done at the lower end of the wood-lot, and\nEthan was out early the next day.\n\nThe winter morning was as clear as crystal. The sunrise burned red in a\npure sky, the shadows on the rim of the wood-lot were darkly blue, and\nbeyond the white and scintillating fields patches of far-off forest hung\nlike smoke.\n\nIt was in the early morning stillness, when his muscles were swinging\nto their familiar task and his lungs expanding with long draughts of\nmountain air, that Ethan did his clearest thinking. He and Zeena had not\nexchanged a word after the door of their room had closed on them. She\nhad measured out some drops from a medicine-bottle on a chair by the bed\nand, after swallowing them, and wrapping her head in a piece of yellow\nflannel, had lain down with her face turned away. Ethan undressed\nhurriedly and blew out the light so that he should not see her when he\ntook his place at her side. As he lay there he could hear Mattie moving\nabout in her room, and her candle, sending its small ray across the\nlanding, drew a scarcely perceptible line of light under his door. He\nkept his eyes fixed on the light till it vanished. Then the room grew\nperfectly black, and not a sound was audible but Zeena's asthmatic\nbreathing. Ethan felt confusedly that there were many things he ought\nto think about, but through his tingling veins and tired brain only one\nsensation throbbed: the warmth of Mattie's shoulder against his. Why had\nhe not kissed her when he held her there? A few hours earlier he would\nnot have asked himself the question. Even a few minutes earlier, when\nthey had stood alone outside the house, he would not have dared to think\nof kissing her. But since he had seen her lips in the lamplight he felt\nthat they were his.\n\nNow, in the bright morning air, her face was still before him. It was\npart of the sun's red and of the pure glitter on the snow. How the\ngirl had changed since she had come to Starkfield! He remembered what a\ncolourless slip of a thing she had looked the day he had met her at the\nstation. And all the first winter, how she had shivered with cold when\nthe northerly gales shook the thin clapboards and the snow beat like\nhail against the loose-hung windows!\n\nHe had been afraid that she would hate the hard life, the cold and\nloneliness; but not a sign of discontent escaped her. Zeena took the\nview that Mattie was bound to make the best of Starkfield since she\nhadn't any other place to go to; but this did not strike Ethan as\nconclusive. Zeena, at any rate, did not apply the principle in her own\ncase.\n\nHe felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had, in\na sense, indentured her to them. Mattie Silver was the daughter of\na cousin of Zenobia Frome's, who had inflamed his clan with mingled\nsentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to\nConnecticut, where he had married a Stamford girl and succeeded to\nher father's thriving \"drug\" business. Unhappily Orin Silver, a man of\nfar-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the\nmeans. His accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and these\nwere such that it was fortunate for his wife and daughter that his books\nwere examined only after his impressive funeral. His wife died of the\ndisclosure, and Mattie, at twenty, was left alone to make her way on the\nfifty dollars obtained from the sale of her piano. For this purpose her\nequipment, though varied, was inadequate. She could trim a hat, make\nmolasses candy, recite \"Curfew shall not ring to-night,\" and play \"The\nLost Chord\" and a pot-pourri from \"Carmen.\" When she tried to extend the\nfield of her activities in the direction of stenography and book-keeping\nher health broke down, and six months on her feet behind the counter of\na department store did not tend to restore it. Her nearest relations had\nbeen induced to place their savings in her father's hands, and though,\nafter his death, they ungrudgingly acquitted themselves of the Christian\nduty of returning good for evil by giving his daughter all the advice\nat their disposal, they could hardly be expected to supplement it by\nmaterial aid. But when Zenobia's doctor recommended her looking about\nfor some one to help her with the house-work the clan instantly saw the\nchance of exacting a compensation from Mattie. Zenobia, though doubtful\nof the girl's efficiency, was tempted by the freedom to find fault\nwithout much risk of losing her; and so Mattie came to Starkfield.\n\nZenobia's fault-finding was of the silent kind, but not the less\npenetrating for that. During the first months Ethan alternately burned\nwith the desire to see Mattie defy her and trembled with fear of the\nresult. Then the situation grew less strained. The pure air, and the\nlong summer hours in the open, gave back life and elasticity to Mattie,\nand Zeena, with more leisure to devote to her complex ailments, grew\nless watchful of the girl's omissions; so that Ethan, struggling on\nunder the burden of his barren farm and failing saw-mill, could at least\nimagine that peace reigned in his house.\n\nThere was really, even now, no tangible evidence to the contrary; but\nsince the previous night a vague dread had hung on his sky-line. It was\nformed of Zeena's obstinate silence, of Mattie's sudden look of warning,\nof the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which\ntold him, on certain stainless mornings, that before night there would\nbe rain.\n\nHis dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty.\nThe hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be\ndelivered to Andrew Hale, the Starkfield builder, it was really easier\nfor Ethan to send Jotham Powell, the hired man, back to the farm on\nfoot, and drive the load down to the village himself. He had scrambled\nup on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggy\ngrays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had a\nvision of the warning look that Mattie had given him the night before.\n\n\"If there's going to be any trouble I want to be there,\" was his vague\nreflection, as he threw to Jotham the unexpected order to unhitch the\nteam and lead them back to the barn.\n\nIt was a slow trudge home through the heavy fields, and when the two\nmen entered the kitchen Mattie was lifting the coffee from the stove and\nZeena was already at the table. Her husband stopped short at sight of\nher. Instead of her usual calico wrapper and knitted shawl she wore her\nbest dress of brown merino, and above her thin strands of hair, which\nstill preserved the tight undulations of the crimping-pins, rose a hard\nperpendicular bonnet, as to which Ethan's clearest notion was that he\nhad to pay five dollars for it at the Bettsbridge Emporium. On the floor\nbeside her stood his old valise and a bandbox wrapped in newspapers.\n\n\"Why, where are you going, Zeena?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I've got my shooting pains so bad that I'm going over to Bettsbridge\nto spend the night with Aunt Martha Pierce and see that new doctor,\" she\nanswered in a matter-of-fact tone, as if she had said she was going into\nthe store-room to take a look at the preserves, or up to the attic to go\nover the blankets.\n\nIn spite of her sedentary habits such abrupt decisions were not without\nprecedent in Zeena's history. Twice or thrice before she had suddenly\npacked Ethan's valise and started off to Bettsbridge, or even\nSpringfield, to seek the advice of some new doctor, and her husband had\ngrown to dread these expeditions because of their cost. Zeena always\ncame back laden with expensive remedies, and her last visit to\nSpringfield had been commemorated by her paying twenty dollars for an\nelectric battery of which she had never been able to learn the use. But\nfor the moment his sense of relief was so great as to preclude all other\nfeelings. He had now no doubt that Zeena had spoken the truth in saying,\nthe night before, that she had sat up because she felt \"too mean\" to\nsleep: her abrupt resolve to seek medical advice showed that, as usual,\nshe was wholly absorbed in her health.\n\nAs if expecting a protest, she continued plaintively; \"If you're too\nbusy with the hauling I presume you can let Jotham Powell drive me over\nwith the sorrel in time to ketch the train at the Flats.\"\n\nHer husband hardly heard what she was saying. During the winter months\nthere was no stage between Starkfield and Bettsbridge, and the trains\nwhich stopped at Corbury Flats were slow and infrequent. A rapid\ncalculation showed Ethan that Zeena could not be back at the farm before\nthe following evening....\n\n\"If I'd supposed you'd 'a' made any objection to Jotham Powell's driving\nme over--\" she began again, as though his silence had implied refusal. On\nthe brink of departure she was always seized with a flux of words. \"All\nI know is,\" she continued, \"I can't go on the way I am much longer.\nThe pains are clear away down to my ankles now, or I'd 'a' walked in to\nStarkfield on my own feet, sooner'n put you out, and asked Michael Eady\nto let me ride over on his wagon to the Flats, when he sends to meet the\ntrain that brings his groceries. I'd 'a' had two hours to wait in the\nstation, but I'd sooner 'a' done it, even with this cold, than to have\nyou say--\"\n\n\"Of course Jotham'll drive you over,\" Ethan roused himself to answer.\nHe became suddenly conscious that he was looking at Mattie while Zeena\ntalked to him, and with an effort he turned his eyes to his wife. She\nsat opposite the window, and the pale light reflected from the banks of\nsnow made her face look more than usually drawn and bloodless, sharpened\nthe three parallel creases between ear and cheek, and drew querulous\nlines from her thin nose to the corners of her mouth. Though she was but\nseven years her husband's senior, and he was only twenty-eight, she was\nalready an old woman.\n\nEthan tried to say something befitting the occasion, but there was only\none thought in his mind: the fact that, for the first time since\nMattie had come to live with them, Zeena was to be away for a night. He\nwondered if the girl were thinking of it too....\n\nHe knew that Zeena must be wondering why he did not offer to drive her\nto the Flats and let Jotham Powell take the lumber to Starkfield, and\nat first he could not think of a pretext for not doing so; then he said:\n\"I'd take you over myself, only I've got to collect the cash for the\nlumber.\"\n\nAs soon as the words were spoken he regretted them, not only because\nthey were untrue--there being no prospect of his receiving cash payment\nfrom Hale--but also because he knew from experience the imprudence of\nletting Zeena think he was in funds on the eve of one of her therapeutic\nexcursions. At the moment, however, his one desire was to avoid the long\ndrive with her behind the ancient sorrel who never went out of a walk.\n\nZeena made no reply: she did not seem to hear what he had said. She had\nalready pushed her plate aside, and was measuring out a draught from a\nlarge bottle at her elbow.\n\n\"It ain't done me a speck of good, but I guess I might as well use it\nup,\" she remarked; adding, as she pushed the empty bottle toward Mattie:\n\"If you can get the taste out it'll do for pickles.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAs soon as his wife had driven off Ethan took his coat and cap from the\npeg. Mattie was washing up the dishes, humming one of the dance tunes\nof the night before. He said \"So long, Matt,\" and she answered gaily \"So\nlong, Ethan\"; and that was all.\n\nIt was warm and bright in the kitchen. The sun slanted through the south\nwindow on the girl's moving figure, on the cat dozing in a chair, and on\nthe geraniums brought in from the door-way, where Ethan had planted\nthem in the summer to \"make a garden\" for Mattie. He would have liked to\nlinger on, watching her tidy up and then settle down to her sewing; but\nhe wanted still more to get the hauling done and be back at the farm\nbefore night.\n\nAll the way down to the village he continued to think of his return to\nMattie. The kitchen was a poor place, not \"spruce\" and shining as his\nmother had kept it in his boyhood; but it was surprising what a homelike\nlook the mere fact of Zeena's absence gave it. And he pictured what it\nwould be like that evening, when he and Mattie were there after supper.\nFor the first time they would be alone together indoors, and they would\nsit there, one on each side of the stove, like a married couple, he in\nhis stocking feet and smoking his pipe, she laughing and talking in that\nfunny way she had, which was always as new to him as if he had never\nheard her before.\n\nThe sweetness of the picture, and the relief of knowing that his fears\nof \"trouble\" with Zeena were unfounded, sent up his spirits with a rush,\nand he, who was usually so silent, whistled and sang aloud as he\ndrove through the snowy fields. There was in him a slumbering spark of\nsociability which the long Starkfield winters had not yet extinguished.\nBy nature grave and inarticulate, he admired recklessness and gaiety in\nothers and was warmed to the marrow by friendly human intercourse. At\nWorcester, though he had the name of keeping to himself and not being\nmuch of a hand at a good time, he had secretly gloried in being clapped\non the back and hailed as \"Old Ethe\" or \"Old Stiff\"; and the cessation\nof such familiarities had increased the chill of his return to\nStarkfield.\n\nThere the silence had deepened about him year by year. Left alone, after\nhis father's accident, to carry the burden of farm and mill, he had had\nno time for convivial loiterings in the village; and when his mother\nfell ill the loneliness of the house grew more oppressive than that\nof the fields. His mother had been a talker in her day, but after her\n\"trouble\" the sound of her voice was seldom heard, though she had not\nlost the power of speech. Sometimes, in the long winter evenings, when\nin desperation her son asked her why she didn't \"say something,\" she\nwould lift a finger and answer: \"Because I'm listening\"; and on stormy\nnights, when the loud wind was about the house, she would complain, if\nhe spoke to her: \"They're talking so out there that I can't hear you.\"\n\nIt was only when she drew toward her last illness, and his cousin\nZenobia Pierce came over from the next valley to help him nurse her,\nthat human speech was heard again in the house. After the mortal silence\nof his long imprisonment Zeena's volubility was music in his ears. He\nfelt that he might have \"gone like his mother\" if the sound of a new\nvoice had not come to steady him. Zeena seemed to understand his case\nat a glance. She laughed at him for not knowing the simplest sick-bed\nduties and told him to \"go right along out\" and leave her to see to\nthings. The mere fact of obeying her orders, of feeling free to go about\nhis business again and talk with other men, restored his shaken balance\nand magnified his sense of what he owed her. Her efficiency shamed and\ndazzled him. She seemed to possess by instinct all the household wisdom\nthat his long apprenticeship had not instilled in him. When the end came\nit was she who had to tell him to hitch up and go for the undertaker,\nand she thought it \"funny\" that he had not settled beforehand who was\nto have his mother's clothes and the sewing-machine. After the funeral,\nwhen he saw her preparing to go away, he was seized with an unreasoning\ndread of being left alone on the farm; and before he knew what he was\ndoing he had asked her to stay there with him. He had often thought\nsince that it would not have happened if his mother had died in spring\ninstead of winter...\n\nWhen they married it was agreed that, as soon as he could straighten out\nthe difficulties resulting from Mrs. Frome's long illness, they would\nsell the farm and saw-mill and try their luck in a large town. Ethan's\nlove of nature did not take the form of a taste for agriculture. He had\nalways wanted to be an engineer, and to live in towns, where there\nwere lectures and big libraries and \"fellows doing things.\" A slight\nengineering job in Florida, put in his way during his period of study at\nWorcester, increased his faith in his ability as well as his eagerness\nto see the world; and he felt sure that, with a \"smart\" wife like Zeena,\nit would not be long before he had made himself a place in it.\n\nZeena's native village was slightly larger and nearer to the railway\nthan Starkfield, and she had let her husband see from the first that\nlife on an isolated farm was not what she had expected when she married.\nBut purchasers were slow in coming, and while he waited for them Ethan\nlearned the impossibility of transplanting her. She chose to look down\non Starkfield, but she could not have lived in a place which looked\ndown on her. Even Bettsbridge or Shadd's Falls would not have been\nsufficiently aware of her, and in the greater cities which attracted\nEthan she would have suffered a complete loss of identity. And within\na year of their marriage she developed the \"sickliness\" which had since\nmade her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances.\nWhen she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to Ethan like\nthe very genius of health, but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse had\nbeen acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms.\n\nThen she too fell silent. Perhaps it was the inevitable effect of life\non the farm, or perhaps, as she sometimes said, it was because Ethan\n\"never listened.\" The charge was not wholly unfounded. When she spoke\nit was only to complain, and to complain of things not in his power to\nremedy; and to check a tendency to impatient retort he had first formed\nthe habit of not answering her, and finally of thinking of other things\nwhile she talked. Of late, however, since he had reasons for observing\nher more closely, her silence had begun to trouble him. He recalled his\nmother's growing taciturnity, and wondered if Zeena were also turning\n\"queer.\" Women did, he knew. Zeena, who had at her fingers' ends the\npathological chart of the whole region, had cited many cases of the kind\nwhile she was nursing his mother; and he himself knew of certain lonely\nfarm-houses in the neighbourhood where stricken creatures pined, and\nof others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence. At times,\nlooking at Zeena's shut face, he felt the chill of such forebodings.\nAt other times her silence seemed deliberately assumed to conceal\nfar-reaching intentions, mysterious conclusions drawn from suspicions\nand resentments impossible to guess. That supposition was even more\ndisturbing than the other; and it was the one which had come to him the\nnight before, when he had seen her standing in the kitchen door.\n\nNow her departure for Bettsbridge had once more eased his mind, and all\nhis thoughts were on the prospect of his evening with Mattie. Only one\nthing weighed on him, and that was his having told Zeena that he was to\nreceive cash for the lumber. He foresaw so clearly the consequences\nof this imprudence that with considerable reluctance he decided to ask\nAndrew Hale for a small advance on his load.\n\nWhen Ethan drove into Hale's yard the builder was just getting out of\nhis sleigh.\n\n\"Hello, Ethe!\" he said. \"This comes handy.\"\n\nAndrew Hale was a ruddy man with a big gray moustache and a stubbly\ndouble-chin unconstrained by a collar; but his scrupulously clean shirt\nwas always fastened by a small diamond stud. This display of opulence\nwas misleading, for though he did a fairly good business it was known\nthat his easygoing habits and the demands of his large family frequently\nkept him what Starkfield called \"behind.\" He was an old friend of\nEthan's family, and his house one of the few to which Zeena occasionally\nwent, drawn there by the fact that Mrs. Hale, in her youth, had done\nmore \"doctoring\" than any other woman in Starkfield, and was still a\nrecognised authority on symptoms and treatment.\n\nHale went up to the grays and patted their sweating flanks.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"you keep them two as if they was pets.\"\n\nEthan set about unloading the logs and when he had finished his job he\npushed open the glazed door of the shed which the builder used as his\noffice. Hale sat with his feet up on the stove, his back propped against\na battered desk strewn with papers: the place, like the man, was warm,\ngenial and untidy.\n\n\"Sit right down and thaw out,\" he greeted Ethan.\n\nThe latter did not know how to begin, but at length he managed to bring\nout his request for an advance of fifty dollars. The blood rushed to his\nthin skin under the sting of Hale's astonishment. It was the builder's\ncustom to pay at the end of three months, and there was no precedent\nbetween the two men for a cash settlement.\n\nEthan felt that if he had pleaded an urgent need Hale might have made\nshift to pay him; but pride, and an instinctive prudence, kept him from\nresorting to this argument. After his father's death it had taken time\nto get his head above water, and he did not want Andrew Hale, or any one\nelse in Starkfield, to think he was going under again. Besides, he hated\nlying; if he wanted the money he wanted it, and it was nobody's business\nto ask why. He therefore made his demand with the awkwardness of a proud\nman who will not admit to himself that he is stooping; and he was not\nmuch surprised at Hale's refusal.\n\nThe builder refused genially, as he did everything else: he treated the\nmatter as something in the nature of a practical joke, and wanted to\nknow if Ethan meditated buying a grand piano or adding a \"cupolo\" to his\nhouse; offering, in the latter case, to give his services free of cost.\n\nEthan's arts were soon exhausted, and after an embarrassed pause he\nwished Hale good day and opened the door of the office. As he passed out\nthe builder suddenly called after him: \"See here--you ain't in a tight\nplace, are you?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" Ethan's pride retorted before his reason had time to\nintervene.\n\n\"Well, that's good! Because I am, a shade. Fact is, I was going to ask\nyou to give me a little extra time on that payment. Business is pretty\nslack, to begin with, and then I'm fixing up a little house for Ned and\nRuth when they're married. I'm glad to do it for 'em, but it costs.\" His\nlook appealed to Ethan for sympathy. \"The young people like things nice.\nYou know how it is yourself: it's not so long ago since you fixed up\nyour own place for Zeena.\"\n\nEthan left the grays in Hale's stable and went about some other business\nin the village. As he walked away the builder's last phrase lingered in\nhis ears, and he reflected grimly that his seven years with Zeena seemed\nto Starkfield \"not so long.\"\n\nThe afternoon was drawing to an end, and here and there a lighted pane\nspangled the cold gray dusk and made the snow look whiter. The bitter\nweather had driven every one indoors and Ethan had the long rural street\nto himself. Suddenly he heard the brisk play of sleigh-bells and a\ncutter passed him, drawn by a free-going horse. Ethan recognised Michael\nEady's roan colt, and young Denis Eady, in a handsome new fur cap,\nleaned forward and waved a greeting. \"Hello, Ethe!\" he shouted and spun\non.\n\nThe cutter was going in the direction of the Frome farm, and Ethan's\nheart contracted as he listened to the dwindling bells. What more likely\nthan that Denis Eady had heard of Zeena's departure for Bettsbridge, and\nwas profiting by the opportunity to spend an hour with Mattie? Ethan was\nashamed of the storm of jealousy in his breast. It seemed unworthy of\nthe girl that his thoughts of her should be so violent.\n\nHe walked on to the church corner and entered the shade of the Varnum\nspruces, where he had stood with her the night before. As he passed\ninto their gloom he saw an indistinct outline just ahead of him. At\nhis approach it melted for an instant into two separate shapes and then\nconjoined again, and he heard a kiss, and a half-laughing \"Oh!\" provoked\nby the discovery of his presence. Again the outline hastily disunited\nand the Varnum gate slammed on one half while the other hurried on ahead\nof him. Ethan smiled at the discomfiture he had caused. What did it\nmatter to Ned Hale and Ruth Varnum if they were caught kissing each\nother? Everybody in Starkfield knew they were engaged. It pleased Ethan\nto have surprised a pair of lovers on the spot where he and Mattie had\nstood with such a thirst for each other in their hearts; but he felt a\npang at the thought that these two need not hide their happiness.\n\nHe fetched the grays from Hale's stable and started on his long climb\nback to the farm. The cold was less sharp than earlier in the day and a\nthick fleecy sky threatened snow for the morrow. Here and there a star\npricked through, showing behind it a deep well of blue. In an hour\nor two the moon would push over the ridge behind the farm, burn a\ngold-edged rent in the clouds, and then be swallowed by them. A mournful\npeace hung on the fields, as though they felt the relaxing grasp of the\ncold and stretched themselves in their long winter sleep.\n\nEthan's ears were alert for the jingle of sleigh-bells, but not a sound\nbroke the silence of the lonely road. As he drew near the farm he saw,\nthrough the thin screen of larches at the gate, a light twinkling in\nthe house above him. \"She's up in her room,\" he said to himself, \"fixing\nherself up for supper\"; and he remembered Zeena's sarcastic stare when\nMattie, on the evening of her arrival, had come down to supper with\nsmoothed hair and a ribbon at her neck.\n\nHe passed by the graves on the knoll and turned his head to glance at\none of the older headstones, which had interested him deeply as a boy\nbecause it bore his name.\n\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF\n\nETHAN FROME AND ENDURANCE HIS WIFE,\n\nWHO DWELLED TOGETHER IN PEACE\n\nFOR FIFTY YEARS.\n\nHe used to think that fifty years sounded like a long time to live\ntogether; but now it seemed to him that they might pass in a flash.\nThen, with a sudden dart of irony, he wondered if, when their turn came,\nthe same epitaph would be written over him and Zeena.\n\nHe opened the barn-door and craned his head into the obscurity,\nhalf-fearing to discover Denis Eady's roan colt in the stall beside\nthe sorrel. But the old horse was there alone, mumbling his crib with\ntoothless jaws, and Ethan whistled cheerfully while he bedded down the\ngrays and shook an extra measure of oats into their mangers. His was not\na tuneful throat--but harsh melodies burst from it as he locked the barn\nand sprang up the hill to the house. He reached the kitchen-porch and\nturned the door-handle; but the door did not yield to his touch.\n\nStartled at finding it locked he rattled the handle violently; then\nhe reflected that Mattie was alone and that it was natural she should\nbarricade herself at nightfall. He stood in the darkness expecting to\nhear her step. It did not come, and after vainly straining his ears he\ncalled out in a voice that shook with joy: \"Hello, Matt!\"\n\nSilence answered; but in a minute or two he caught a sound on the stairs\nand saw a line of light about the door-frame, as he had seen it the\nnight before. So strange was the precision with which the incidents of\nthe previous evening were repeating themselves that he half expected,\nwhen he heard the key turn, to see his wife before him on the threshold;\nbut the door opened, and Mattie faced him.\n\nShe stood just as Zeena had stood, a lifted lamp in her hand, against\nthe black background of the kitchen. She held the light at the same\nlevel, and it drew out with the same distinctness her slim young throat\nand the brown wrist no bigger than a child's. Then, striking upward, it\nthrew a lustrous fleck on her lips, edged her eyes with velvet shade,\nand laid a milky whiteness above the black curve of her brows.\n\nShe wore her usual dress of darkish stuff, and there was no bow at her\nneck; but through her hair she had run a streak of crimson ribbon. This\ntribute to the unusual transformed and glorified her. She seemed to\nEthan taller, fuller, more womanly in shape and motion. She stood aside,\nsmiling silently, while he entered, and then moved away from him with\nsomething soft and flowing in her gait. She set the lamp on the table,\nand he saw that it was carefully laid for supper, with fresh dough-nuts,\nstewed blueberries and his favourite pickles in a dish of gay red glass.\nA bright fire glowed in the stove and the cat lay stretched before it,\nwatching the table with a drowsy eye.\n\nEthan was suffocated with the sense of well-being. He went out into the\npassage to hang up his coat and pull off his wet boots. When he came\nback Mattie had set the teapot on the table and the cat was rubbing\nitself persuasively against her ankles.\n\n\"Why, Puss! I nearly tripped over you,\" she cried, the laughter\nsparkling through her lashes.\n\nAgain Ethan felt a sudden twinge of jealousy. Could it be his coming\nthat gave her such a kindled face?\n\n\"Well, Matt, any visitors?\" he threw off, stooping down carelessly to\nexamine the fastening of the stove.\n\nShe nodded and laughed \"Yes, one,\" and he felt a blackness settling on\nhis brows.\n\n\"Who was that?\" he questioned, raising himself up to slant a glance at\nher beneath his scowl.\n\nHer eyes danced with malice. \"Why, Jotham Powell. He came in after he\ngot back, and asked for a drop of coffee before he went down home.\"\n\nThe blackness lifted and light flooded Ethan's brain. \"That all? Well,\nI hope you made out to let him have it.\" And after a pause he felt it\nright to add: \"I suppose he got Zeena over to the Flats all right?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; in plenty of time.\"\n\nThe name threw a chill between them, and they stood a moment looking\nsideways at each other before Mattie said with a shy laugh. \"I guess\nit's about time for supper.\"\n\nThey drew their seats up to the table, and the cat, unbidden, jumped\nbetween them into Zeena's empty chair. \"Oh, Puss!\" said Mattie, and they\nlaughed again.\n\nEthan, a moment earlier, had felt himself on the brink of eloquence;\nbut the mention of Zeena had paralysed him. Mattie seemed to feel the\ncontagion of his embarrassment, and sat with downcast lids, sipping her\ntea, while he feigned an insatiable appetite for dough-nuts and sweet\npickles. At last, after casting about for an effective opening, he took\na long gulp of tea, cleared his throat, and said: \"Looks as if there'd\nbe more snow.\"\n\nShe feigned great interest. \"Is that so? Do you suppose it'll interfere\nwith Zeena's getting back?\" She flushed red as the question escaped her,\nand hastily set down the cup she was lifting.\n\nEthan reached over for another helping of pickles. \"You never can tell,\nthis time of year, it drifts so bad on the Flats.\" The name had benumbed\nhim again, and once more he felt as if Zeena were in the room between\nthem.\n\n\"Oh, Puss, you're too greedy!\" Mattie cried.\n\nThe cat, unnoticed, had crept up on muffled paws from Zeena's seat to\nthe table, and was stealthily elongating its body in the direction\nof the milk-jug, which stood between Ethan and Mattie. The two leaned\nforward at the same moment and their hands met on the handle of the jug.\nMattie's hand was underneath, and Ethan kept his clasped on it a\nmoment longer than was necessary. The cat, profiting by this unusual\ndemonstration, tried to effect an unnoticed retreat, and in doing so\nbacked into the pickle-dish, which fell to the floor with a crash.\n\nMattie, in an instant, had sprung from her chair and was down on her\nknees by the fragments.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan--it's all to pieces! What will Zeena say?\"\n\nBut this time his courage was up. \"Well, she'll have to say it to the\ncat, any way!\" he rejoined with a laugh, kneeling down at Mattie's side\nto scrape up the swimming pickles.\n\nShe lifted stricken eyes to him. \"Yes, but, you see, she never meant it\nshould be used, not even when there was company; and I had to get up on\nthe step-ladder to reach it down from the top shelf of the china-closet,\nwhere she keeps it with all her best things, and of course she'll want\nto know why I did it--\"\n\nThe case was so serious that it called forth all of Ethan's latent\nresolution.\n\n\"She needn't know anything about it if you keep quiet. I'll get another\njust like it to-morrow. Where did it come from? I'll go to Shadd's Falls\nfor it if I have to!\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll never get another even there! It was a wedding present--don't\nyou remember? It came all the way from Philadelphia, from Zeena's aunt\nthat married the minister. That's why she wouldn't ever use it. Oh,\nEthan, Ethan, what in the world shall I do?\"\n\nShe began to cry, and he felt as if every one of her tears were pouring\nover him like burning lead. \"Don't, Matt, don't--oh, don't!\" he implored\nher.\n\nShe struggled to her feet, and he rose and followed her helplessly while\nshe spread out the pieces of glass on the kitchen dresser. It seemed to\nhim as if the shattered fragments of their evening lay there.\n\n\"Here, give them to me,\" he said in a voice of sudden authority.\n\nShe drew aside, instinctively obeying his tone. \"Oh, Ethan, what are you\ngoing to do?\"\n\nWithout replying he gathered the pieces of glass into his broad palm\nand walked out of the kitchen to the passage. There he lit a candle-end,\nopened the china-closet, and, reaching his long arm up to the highest\nshelf, laid the pieces together with such accuracy of touch that a close\ninspection convinced him of the impossibility of detecting from below\nthat the dish was broken. If he glued it together the next morning\nmonths might elapse before his wife noticed what had happened, and\nmeanwhile he might after all be able to match the dish at Shadd's Falls\nor Bettsbridge. Having satisfied himself that there was no risk of\nimmediate discovery he went back to the kitchen with a lighter step, and\nfound Mattie disconsolately removing the last scraps of pickle from the\nfloor.\n\n\"It's all right, Matt. Come back and finish supper,\" he commanded her.\n\nCompletely reassured, she shone on him through tear-hung lashes, and his\nsoul swelled with pride as he saw how his tone subdued her. She did not\neven ask what he had done. Except when he was steering a big log down\nthe mountain to his mill he had never known such a thrilling sense of\nmastery.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThey finished supper, and while Mattie cleared the table Ethan went to\nlook at the cows and then took a last turn about the house. The earth\nlay dark under a muffled sky and the air was so still that now and then\nhe heard a lump of snow come thumping down from a tree far off on the\nedge of the wood-lot.\n\nWhen he returned to the kitchen Mattie had pushed up his chair to the\nstove and seated herself near the lamp with a bit of sewing. The scene\nwas just as he had dreamed of it that morning. He sat down, drew his\npipe from his pocket and stretched his feet to the glow. His hard day's\nwork in the keen air made him feel at once lazy and light of mood, and\nhe had a confused sense of being in another world, where all was warmth\nand harmony and time could bring no change. The only drawback to his\ncomplete well-being was the fact that he could not see Mattie from where\nhe sat; but he was too indolent to move and after a moment he said:\n\"Come over here and sit by the stove.\"\n\nZeena's empty rocking-chair stood facing him. Mattie rose obediently,\nand seated herself in it. As her young brown head detached itself\nagainst the patch-work cushion that habitually framed his wife's gaunt\ncountenance, Ethan had a momentary shock. It was almost as if the other\nface, the face of the superseded woman, had obliterated that of the\nintruder. After a moment Mattie seemed to be affected by the same sense\nof constraint. She changed her position, leaning forward to bend her\nhead above her work, so that he saw only the foreshortened tip of her\nnose and the streak of red in her hair; then she slipped to her feet,\nsaying \"I can't see to sew,\" and went back to her chair by the lamp.\n\nEthan made a pretext of getting up to replenish the stove, and when he\nreturned to his seat he pushed it sideways that he might get a view of\nher profile and of the lamplight falling on her hands. The cat, who\nhad been a puzzled observer of these unusual movements, jumped up into\nZeena's chair, rolled itself into a ball, and lay watching them with\nnarrowed eyes.\n\nDeep quiet sank on the room. The clock ticked above the dresser, a piece\nof charred wood fell now and then in the stove, and the faint sharp\nscent of the geraniums mingled with the odour of Ethan's smoke, which\nbegan to throw a blue haze about the lamp and to hang its greyish\ncobwebs in the shadowy corners of the room.\n\nAll constraint had vanished between the two, and they began to talk\neasily and simply. They spoke of every-day things, of the prospect\nof snow, of the next church sociable, of the loves and quarrels of\nStarkfield. The commonplace nature of what they said produced in Ethan\nan illusion of long-established intimacy which no outburst of emotion\ncould have given, and he set his imagination adrift on the fiction that\nthey had always spent their evenings thus and would always go on doing\nso...\n\n\"This is the night we were to have gone coasting, Matt,\" he said at\nlength, with the rich sense, as he spoke, that they could go on any\nother night they chose, since they had all time before them.\n\nShe smiled back at him. \"I guess you forgot!\"\n\n\"No, I didn't forget; but it's as dark as Egypt outdoors. We might go\nto-morrow if there's a moon.\"\n\nShe laughed with pleasure, her head tilted back, the lamplight sparkling\non her lips and teeth. \"That would be lovely, Ethan!\"\n\nHe kept his eyes fixed on her, marvelling at the way her face changed\nwith each turn of their talk, like a wheat-field under a summer breeze.\nIt was intoxicating to find such magic in his clumsy words, and he\nlonged to try new ways of using it.\n\n\"Would you be scared to go down the Corbury road with me on a night like\nthis?\" he asked.\n\nHer cheeks burned redder. \"I ain't any more scared than you are!\"\n\n\"Well, I'd be scared, then; I wouldn't do it. That's an ugly corner down\nby the big elm. If a fellow didn't keep his eyes open he'd go plumb into\nit.\" He luxuriated in the sense of protection and authority which his\nwords conveyed. To prolong and intensify the feeling he added: \"I guess\nwe're well enough here.\"\n\nShe let her lids sink slowly, in the way he loved. \"Yes, we're well\nenough here,\" she sighed.\n\nHer tone was so sweet that he took the pipe from his mouth and drew his\nchair up to the table. Leaning forward, he touched the farther end of\nthe strip of brown stuff that she was hemming. \"Say, Matt,\" he began\nwith a smile, \"what do you think I saw under the Varnum spruces, coming\nalong home just now? I saw a friend of yours getting kissed.\"\n\nThe words had been on his tongue all the evening, but now that he had\nspoken them they struck him as inexpressibly vulgar and out of place.\n\nMattie blushed to the roots of her hair and pulled her needle rapidly\ntwice or thrice through her work, insensibly drawing the end of it away\nfrom him. \"I suppose it was Ruth and Ned,\" she said in a low voice, as\nthough he had suddenly touched on something grave.\n\nEthan had imagined that his allusion might open the way to the accepted\npleasantries, and these perhaps in turn to a harmless caress, if only\na mere touch on her hand. But now he felt as if her blush had set a\nflaming guard about her. He supposed it was his natural awkwardness that\nmade him feel so. He knew that most young men made nothing at all of\ngiving a pretty girl a kiss, and he remembered that the night before,\nwhen he had put his arm about Mattie, she had not resisted. But that had\nbeen out-of-doors, under the open irresponsible night. Now, in the warm\nlamplit room, with all its ancient implications of conformity and order,\nshe seemed infinitely farther away from him and more unapproachable.\n\nTo ease his constraint he said: \"I suppose they'll be setting a date\nbefore long.\"\n\n\"Yes. I shouldn't wonder if they got married some time along in the\nsummer.\" She pronounced the word married as if her voice caressed it.\nIt seemed a rustling covert leading to enchanted glades. A pang shot\nthrough Ethan, and he said, twisting away from her in his chair: \"It'll\nbe your turn next, I wouldn't wonder.\"\n\nShe laughed a little uncertainly. \"Why do you keep on saying that?\"\n\nHe echoed her laugh. \"I guess I do it to get used to the idea.\"\n\nHe drew up to the table again and she sewed on in silence, with dropped\nlashes, while he sat in fascinated contemplation of the way in which her\nhands went up and down above the strip of stuff, just as he had seen\na pair of birds make short perpendicular flights over a nest they were\nbuilding. At length, without turning her head or lifting her lids, she\nsaid in a low tone: \"It's not because you think Zeena's got anything\nagainst me, is it?\"\n\nHis former dread started up full-armed at the suggestion. \"Why, what do\nyou mean?\" he stammered.\n\nShe raised distressed eyes to his, her work dropping on the table\nbetween them. \"I don't know. I thought last night she seemed to have.\"\n\n\"I'd like to know what,\" he growled.\n\n\"Nobody can tell with Zeena.\" It was the first time they had ever spoken\nso openly of her attitude toward Mattie, and the repetition of the name\nseemed to carry it to the farther corners of the room and send it back\nto them in long repercussions of sound. Mattie waited, as if to give the\necho time to drop, and then went on: \"She hasn't said anything to you?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No, not a word.\"\n\nShe tossed the hair back from her forehead with a laugh. \"I guess I'm\njust nervous, then. I'm not going to think about it any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, no--don't let's think about it, Matt!\"\n\nThe sudden heat of his tone made her colour mount again, not with\na rush, but gradually, delicately, like the reflection of a thought\nstealing slowly across her heart. She sat silent, her hands clasped on\nher work, and it seemed to him that a warm current flowed toward\nhim along the strip of stuff that still lay unrolled between them.\nCautiously he slid his hand palm-downward along the table till his\nfinger-tips touched the end of the stuff. A faint vibration of her\nlashes seemed to show that she was aware of his gesture, and that it had\nsent a counter-current back to her; and she let her hands lie motionless\non the other end of the strip.\n\nAs they sat thus he heard a sound behind him and turned his head. The\ncat had jumped from Zeena's chair to dart at a mouse in the wainscot,\nand as a result of the sudden movement the empty chair had set up a\nspectral rocking.\n\n\"She'll be rocking in it herself this time to-morrow,\" Ethan thought.\n\"I've been in a dream, and this is the only evening we'll ever have\ntogether.\" The return to reality was as painful as the return to\nconsciousness after taking an anaesthetic. His body and brain ached with\nindescribable weariness, and he could think of nothing to say or to do\nthat should arrest the mad flight of the moments.\n\nHis alteration of mood seemed to have communicated itself to Mattie. She\nlooked up at him languidly, as though her lids were weighted with sleep\nand it cost her an effort to raise them. Her glance fell on his hand,\nwhich now completely covered the end of her work and grasped it as if it\nwere a part of herself. He saw a scarcely perceptible tremor cross her\nface, and without knowing what he did he stooped his head and kissed\nthe bit of stuff in his hold. As his lips rested on it he felt it glide\nslowly from beneath them, and saw that Mattie had risen and was silently\nrolling up her work. She fastened it with a pin, and then, finding\nher thimble and scissors, put them with the roll of stuff into the\nbox covered with fancy paper which he had once brought to her from\nBettsbridge.\n\nHe stood up also, looking vaguely about the room. The clock above the\ndresser struck eleven.\n\n\"Is the fire all right?\" she asked in a low voice.\n\nHe opened the door of the stove and poked aimlessly at the embers. When\nhe raised himself again he saw that she was dragging toward the stove\nthe old soap-box lined with carpet in which the cat made its bed. Then\nshe recrossed the floor and lifted two of the geranium pots in her arms,\nmoving them away from the cold window. He followed her and brought the\nother geraniums, the hyacinth bulbs in a cracked custard bowl and the\nGerman ivy trained over an old croquet hoop.\n\nWhen these nightly duties were performed there was nothing left to do\nbut to bring in the tin candlestick from the passage, light the candle\nand blow out the lamp. Ethan put the candlestick in Mattie's hand and\nshe went out of the kitchen ahead of him, the light that she carried\nbefore her making her dark hair look like a drift of mist on the moon.\n\n\"Good night, Matt,\" he said as she put her foot on the first step of the\nstairs.\n\nShe turned and looked at him a moment. \"Good night, Ethan,\" she\nanswered, and went up.\n\nWhen the door of her room had closed on her he remembered that he had\nnot even touched her hand.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe next morning at breakfast Jotham Powell was between them, and Ethan\ntried to hide his joy under an air of exaggerated indifference, lounging\nback in his chair to throw scraps to the cat, growling at the weather,\nand not so much as offering to help Mattie when she rose to clear away\nthe dishes.\n\nHe did not know why he was so irrationally happy, for nothing was\nchanged in his life or hers. He had not even touched the tip of her\nfingers or looked her full in the eyes. But their evening together had\ngiven him a vision of what life at her side might be, and he was glad\nnow that he had done nothing to trouble the sweetness of the picture. He\nhad a fancy that she knew what had restrained him...\n\nThere was a last load of lumber to be hauled to the village, and Jotham\nPowell--who did not work regularly for Ethan in winter--had \"come round\"\nto help with the job. But a wet snow, melting to sleet, had fallen in\nthe night and turned the roads to glass. There was more wet in the air\nand it seemed likely to both men that the weather would \"milden\" toward\nafternoon and make the going safer. Ethan therefore proposed to his\nassistant that they should load the sledge at the wood-lot, as they had\ndone on the previous morning, and put off the \"teaming\" to Starkfield\ntill later in the day. This plan had the advantage of enabling him to\nsend Jotham to the Flats after dinner to meet Zenobia, while he himself\ntook the lumber down to the village.\n\nHe told Jotham to go out and harness up the greys, and for a moment he\nand Mattie had the kitchen to themselves. She had plunged the breakfast\ndishes into a tin dish-pan and was bending above it with her slim arms\nbared to the elbow, the steam from the hot water beading her forehead\nand tightening her rough hair into little brown rings like the tendrils\non the traveller's joy.\n\nEthan stood looking at her, his heart in his throat. He wanted to say:\n\"We shall never be alone again like this.\" Instead, he reached down his\ntobacco-pouch from a shelf of the dresser, put it into his pocket and\nsaid: \"I guess I can make out to be home for dinner.\"\n\nShe answered \"All right, Ethan,\" and he heard her singing over the\ndishes as he went.\n\nAs soon as the sledge was loaded he meant to send Jotham back to\nthe farm and hurry on foot into the village to buy the glue for the\npickle-dish. With ordinary luck he should have had time to carry out\nthis plan; but everything went wrong from the start. On the way over\nto the wood-lot one of the greys slipped on a glare of ice and cut his\nknee; and when they got him up again Jotham had to go back to the barn\nfor a strip of rag to bind the cut. Then, when the loading finally\nbegan, a sleety rain was coming down once more, and the tree trunks were\nso slippery that it took twice as long as usual to lift them and get\nthem in place on the sledge. It was what Jotham called a sour morning\nfor work, and the horses, shivering and stamping under their wet\nblankets, seemed to like it as little as the men. It was long past the\ndinner-hour when the job was done, and Ethan had to give up going to the\nvillage because he wanted to lead the injured horse home and wash the\ncut himself.\n\nHe thought that by starting out again with the lumber as soon as he had\nfinished his dinner he might get back to the farm with the glue before\nJotham and the old sorrel had had time to fetch Zenobia from the Flats;\nbut he knew the chance was a slight one. It turned on the state of\nthe roads and on the possible lateness of the Bettsbridge train.\nHe remembered afterward, with a grim flash of self-derision, what\nimportance he had attached to the weighing of these probabilities...\n\nAs soon as dinner was over he set out again for the wood-lot, not daring\nto linger till Jotham Powell left. The hired man was still drying his\nwet feet at the stove, and Ethan could only give Mattie a quick look as\nhe said beneath his breath: \"I'll be back early.\"\n\nHe fancied that she nodded her comprehension; and with that scant solace\nhe had to trudge off through the rain.\n\nHe had driven his load half-way to the village when Jotham Powell\novertook him, urging the reluctant sorrel toward the Flats. \"I'll have\nto hurry up to do it,\" Ethan mused, as the sleigh dropped down ahead\nof him over the dip of the school-house hill. He worked like ten at the\nunloading, and when it was over hastened on to Michael Eady's for the\nglue. Eady and his assistant were both \"down street,\" and young Denis,\nwho seldom deigned to take their place, was lounging by the stove with\na knot of the golden youth of Starkfield. They hailed Ethan with ironic\ncompliment and offers of conviviality; but no one knew where to find\nthe glue. Ethan, consumed with the longing for a last moment alone with\nMattie, hung about impatiently while Denis made an ineffectual search in\nthe obscurer corners of the store.\n\n\"Looks as if we were all sold out. But if you'll wait around till the\nold man comes along maybe he can put his hand on it.\"\n\n\"I'm obliged to you, but I'll try if I can get it down at Mrs. Homan's,\"\nEthan answered, burning to be gone.\n\nDenis's commercial instinct compelled him to aver on oath that what\nEady's store could not produce would never be found at the widow\nHoman's; but Ethan, heedless of this boast, had already climbed to\nthe sledge and was driving on to the rival establishment. Here, after\nconsiderable search, and sympathetic questions as to what he wanted\nit for, and whether ordinary flour paste wouldn't do as well if she\ncouldn't find it, the widow Homan finally hunted down her solitary\nbottle of glue to its hiding-place in a medley of cough-lozenges and\ncorset-laces.\n\n\"I hope Zeena ain't broken anything she sets store by,\" she called after\nhim as he turned the greys toward home.\n\nThe fitful bursts of sleet had changed into a steady rain and the horses\nhad heavy work even without a load behind them. Once or twice, hearing\nsleigh-bells, Ethan turned his head, fancying that Zeena and Jotham\nmight overtake him; but the old sorrel was not in sight, and he set his\nface against the rain and urged on his ponderous pair.\n\nThe barn was empty when the horses turned into it and, after giving them\nthe most perfunctory ministrations they had ever received from him, he\nstrode up to the house and pushed open the kitchen door.\n\nMattie was there alone, as he had pictured her. She was bending over a\npan on the stove; but at the sound of his step she turned with a start\nand sprang to him.\n\n\"See, here, Matt, I've got some stuff to mend the dish with! Let me get\nat it quick,\" he cried, waving the bottle in one hand while he put her\nlightly aside; but she did not seem to hear him.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan--Zeena's come,\" she said in a whisper, clutching his sleeve.\n\nThey stood and stared at each other, pale as culprits.\n\n\"But the sorrel's not in the barn!\" Ethan stammered.\n\n\"Jotham Powell brought some goods over from the Flats for his wife, and\nhe drove right on home with them,\" she explained.\n\nHe gazed blankly about the kitchen, which looked cold and squalid in the\nrainy winter twilight.\n\n\"How is she?\" he asked, dropping his voice to Mattie's whisper.\n\nShe looked away from him uncertainly. \"I don't know. She went right up\nto her room.\"\n\n\"She didn't say anything?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nEthan let out his doubts in a low whistle and thrust the bottle back\ninto his pocket. \"Don't fret; I'll come down and mend it in the night,\"\nhe said. He pulled on his wet coat again and went back to the barn to\nfeed the greys.\n\nWhile he was there Jotham Powell drove up with the sleigh, and when the\nhorses had been attended to Ethan said to him: \"You might as well come\nback up for a bite.\" He was not sorry to assure himself of Jotham's\nneutralising presence at the supper table, for Zeena was always\n\"nervous\" after a journey. But the hired man, though seldom loth to\naccept a meal not included in his wages, opened his stiff jaws to answer\nslowly: \"I'm obliged to you, but I guess I'll go along back.\"\n\nEthan looked at him in surprise. \"Better come up and dry off. Looks as\nif there'd be something hot for supper.\"\n\nJotham's facial muscles were unmoved by this appeal and, his vocabulary\nbeing limited, he merely repeated: \"I guess I'll go along back.\"\n\nTo Ethan there was something vaguely ominous in this stolid rejection of\nfree food and warmth, and he wondered what had happened on the drive to\nnerve Jotham to such stoicism. Perhaps Zeena had failed to see the new\ndoctor or had not liked his counsels: Ethan knew that in such cases\nthe first person she met was likely to be held responsible for her\ngrievance.\n\nWhen he re-entered the kitchen the lamp lit up the same scene of shining\ncomfort as on the previous evening. The table had been as carefully\nlaid, a clear fire glowed in the stove, the cat dozed in its warmth, and\nMattie came forward carrying a plate of dough-nuts.\n\nShe and Ethan looked at each other in silence; then she said, as she had\nsaid the night before: \"I guess it's about time for supper.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nEthan went out into the passage to hang up his wet garments. He listened\nfor Zeena's step and, not hearing it, called her name up the stairs. She\ndid not answer, and after a moment's hesitation he went up and opened\nher door. The room was almost dark, but in the obscurity he saw her\nsitting by the window, bolt upright, and knew by the rigidity of the\noutline projected against the pane that she had not taken off her\ntravelling dress.\n\n\"Well, Zeena,\" he ventured from the threshold.\n\nShe did not move, and he continued: \"Supper's about ready. Ain't you\ncoming?\"\n\nShe replied: \"I don't feel as if I could touch a morsel.\"\n\nIt was the consecrated formula, and he expected it to be followed, as\nusual, by her rising and going down to supper. But she remained seated,\nand he could think of nothing more felicitous than: \"I presume you're\ntired after the long ride.\"\n\nTurning her head at this, she answered solemnly: \"I'm a great deal\nsicker than you think.\"\n\nHer words fell on his ear with a strange shock of wonder. He had often\nheard her pronounce them before--what if at last they were true?\n\nHe advanced a step or two into the dim room. \"I hope that's not so,\nZeena,\" he said.\n\nShe continued to gaze at him through the twilight with a mien of wan\nauthority, as of one consciously singled out for a great fate. \"I've got\ncomplications,\" she said.\n\nEthan knew the word for one of exceptional import. Almost everybody in\nthe neighbourhood had \"troubles,\" frankly localized and specified;\nbut only the chosen had \"complications.\" To have them was in itself a\ndistinction, though it was also, in most cases, a death-warrant. People\nstruggled on for years with \"troubles,\" but they almost always succumbed\nto \"complications.\"\n\nEthan's heart was jerking to and fro between two extremities of feeling,\nbut for the moment compassion prevailed. His wife looked so hard and\nlonely, sitting there in the darkness with such thoughts.\n\n\"Is that what the new doctor told you?\" he asked, instinctively lowering\nhis voice.\n\n\"Yes. He says any regular doctor would want me to have an operation.\"\n\nEthan was aware that, in regard to the important question of surgical\nintervention, the female opinion of the neighbourhood was divided, some\nglorying in the prestige conferred by operations while others shunned\nthem as indelicate. Ethan, from motives of economy, had always been glad\nthat Zeena was of the latter faction.\n\nIn the agitation caused by the gravity of her announcement he sought\na consolatory short cut. \"What do you know about this doctor anyway?\nNobody ever told you that before.\"\n\nHe saw his blunder before she could take it up: she wanted sympathy, not\nconsolation.\n\n\"I didn't need to have anybody tell me I was losing ground every day.\nEverybody but you could see it. And everybody in Bettsbridge knows\nabout Dr. Buck. He has his office in Worcester, and comes over once\na fortnight to Shadd's Falls and Bettsbridge for consultations. Eliza\nSpears was wasting away with kidney trouble before she went to him, and\nnow she's up and around, and singing in the choir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad of that. You must do just what he tells you,\" Ethan\nanswered sympathetically.\n\nShe was still looking at him. \"I mean to,\" she said. He was struck by a\nnew note in her voice. It was neither whining nor reproachful, but drily\nresolute.\n\n\"What does he want you should do?\" he asked, with a mounting vision of\nfresh expenses.\n\n\"He wants I should have a hired girl. He says I oughtn't to have to do a\nsingle thing around the house.\"\n\n\"A hired girl?\" Ethan stood transfixed.\n\n\"Yes. And Aunt Martha found me one right off. Everybody said I was lucky\nto get a girl to come away out here, and I agreed to give her a dollar\nextry to make sure. She'll be over to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\nWrath and dismay contended in Ethan. He had foreseen an immediate demand\nfor money, but not a permanent drain on his scant resources. He no\nlonger believed what Zeena had told him of the supposed seriousness of\nher state: he saw in her expedition to Bettsbridge only a plot hatched\nbetween herself and her Pierce relations to foist on him the cost of a\nservant; and for the moment wrath predominated.\n\n\"If you meant to engage a girl you ought to have told me before you\nstarted,\" he said.\n\n\"How could I tell you before I started? How did I know what Dr. Buck\nwould say?\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Buck--\" Ethan's incredulity escaped in a short laugh. \"Did Dr.\nBuck tell you how I was to pay her wages?\"\n\nHer voice rose furiously with his. \"No, he didn't. For I'd 'a' been\nashamed to tell him that you grudged me the money to get back my health,\nwhen I lost it nursing your own mother!\"\n\n\"You lost your health nursing mother?\"\n\n\"Yes; and my folks all told me at the time you couldn't do no less than\nmarry me after--\"\n\n\"Zeena!\"\n\nThrough the obscurity which hid their faces their thoughts seemed to\ndart at each other like serpents shooting venom. Ethan was seized\nwith horror of the scene and shame at his own share in it. It was as\nsenseless and savage as a physical fight between two enemies in the\ndarkness.\n\nHe turned to the shelf above the chimney, groped for matches and lit the\none candle in the room. At first its weak flame made no impression on\nthe shadows; then Zeena's face stood grimly out against the uncurtained\npane, which had turned from grey to black.\n\nIt was the first scene of open anger between the couple in their sad\nseven years together, and Ethan felt as if he had lost an irretrievable\nadvantage in descending to the level of recrimination. But the practical\nproblem was there and had to be dealt with.\n\n\"You know I haven't got the money to pay for a girl, Zeena. You'll have\nto send her back: I can't do it.\"\n\n\"The doctor says it'll be my death if I go on slaving the way I've had\nto. He doesn't understand how I've stood it as long as I have.\"\n\n\"Slaving!--\" He checked himself again, \"You sha'n't lift a hand, if he\nsays so. I'll do everything round the house myself--\"\n\nShe broke in: \"You're neglecting the farm enough already,\" and this\nbeing true, he found no answer, and left her time to add ironically:\n\"Better send me over to the almshouse and done with it... I guess\nthere's been Fromes there afore now.\"\n\nThe taunt burned into him, but he let it pass. \"I haven't got the money.\nThat settles it.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause in the struggle, as though the combatants\nwere testing their weapons. Then Zeena said in a level voice: \"I thought\nyou were to get fifty dollars from Andrew Hale for that lumber.\"\n\n\"Andrew Hale never pays under three months.\" He had hardly spoken when\nhe remembered the excuse he had made for not accompanying his wife to\nthe station the day before; and the blood rose to his frowning brows.\n\n\"Why, you told me yesterday you'd fixed it up with him to pay cash down.\nYou said that was why you couldn't drive me over to the Flats.\"\n\nEthan had no suppleness in deceiving. He had never before been convicted\nof a lie, and all the resources of evasion failed him. \"I guess that was\na misunderstanding,\" he stammered.\n\n\"You ain't got the money?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you ain't going to get it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I couldn't know that when I engaged the girl, could I?\"\n\n\"No.\" He paused to control his voice. \"But you know it now. I'm sorry,\nbut it can't be helped. You're a poor man's wife, Zeena; but I'll do the\nbest I can for you.\"\n\nFor a while she sat motionless, as if reflecting, her arms stretched\nalong the arms of her chair, her eyes fixed on vacancy. \"Oh, I guess\nwe'll make out,\" she said mildly.\n\nThe change in her tone reassured him. \"Of course we will! There's a\nwhole lot more I can do for you, and Mattie--\"\n\nZeena, while he spoke, seemed to be following out some elaborate mental\ncalculation. She emerged from it to say: \"There'll be Mattie's board\nless, any how--\"\n\nEthan, supposing the discussion to be over, had turned to go down to\nsupper. He stopped short, not grasping what he heard. \"Mattie's board\nless--?\" he began.\n\nZeena laughed. It was on odd unfamiliar sound--he did not remember ever\nhaving heard her laugh before. \"You didn't suppose I was going to keep\ntwo girls, did you? No wonder you were scared at the expense!\"\n\nHe still had but a confused sense of what she was saying. From the\nbeginning of the discussion he had instinctively avoided the mention of\nMattie's name, fearing he hardly knew what: criticism, complaints, or\nvague allusions to the imminent probability of her marrying. But the\nthought of a definite rupture had never come to him, and even now could\nnot lodge itself in his mind.\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" he said. \"Mattie Silver's not a hired\ngirl. She's your relation.\"\n\n\"She's a pauper that's hung onto us all after her father'd done his best\nto ruin us. I've kep' her here a whole year: it's somebody else's turn\nnow.\"\n\nAs the shrill words shot out Ethan heard a tap on the door, which he had\ndrawn shut when he turned back from the threshold.\n\n\"Ethan--Zeena!\" Mattie's voice sounded gaily from the landing, \"do you\nknow what time it is? Supper's been ready half an hour.\"\n\nInside the room there was a moment's silence; then Zeena called out from\nher seat: \"I'm not coming down to supper.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! Aren't you well? Sha'n't I bring you up a bite of\nsomething?\"\n\nEthan roused himself with an effort and opened the door. \"Go along down,\nMatt. Zeena's just a little tired. I'm coming.\"\n\nHe heard her \"All right!\" and her quick step on the stairs; then he\nshut the door and turned back into the room. His wife's attitude was\nunchanged, her face inexorable, and he was seized with the despairing\nsense of his helplessness.\n\n\"You ain't going to do it, Zeena?\"\n\n\"Do what?\" she emitted between flattened lips.\n\n\"Send Mattie away--like this?\"\n\n\"I never bargained to take her for life!\"\n\nHe continued with rising vehemence: \"You can't put her out of the house\nlike a thief--a poor girl without friends or money. She's done her best\nfor you and she's got no place to go to. You may forget she's your kin\nbut everybody else'll remember it. If you do a thing like that what do\nyou suppose folks'll say of you?\"\n\nZeena waited a moment, as if giving him time to feel the full force\nof the contrast between his own excitement and her composure. Then she\nreplied in the same smooth voice: \"I know well enough what they say of\nmy having kep' her here as long as I have.\"\n\nEthan's hand dropped from the door-knob, which he had held clenched\nsince he had drawn the door shut on Mattie. His wife's retort was like a\nknife-cut across the sinews and he felt suddenly weak and powerless.\nHe had meant to humble himself, to argue that Mattie's keep didn't cost\nmuch, after all, that he could make out to buy a stove and fix up a\nplace in the attic for the hired girl--but Zeena's words revealed the\nperil of such pleadings.\n\n\"You mean to tell her she's got to go--at once?\" he faltered out, in\nterror of letting his wife complete her sentence.\n\nAs if trying to make him see reason she replied impartially: \"The girl\nwill be over from Bettsbridge to-morrow, and I presume she's got to have\nsomewheres to sleep.\"\n\nEthan looked at her with loathing. She was no longer the listless\ncreature who had lived at his side in a state of sullen self-absorption,\nbut a mysterious alien presence, an evil energy secreted from the long\nyears of silent brooding. It was the sense of his helplessness that\nsharpened his antipathy. There had never been anything in her that\none could appeal to; but as long as he could ignore and command he had\nremained indifferent. Now she had mastered him and he abhorred her.\nMattie was her relation, not his: there were no means by which he could\ncompel her to keep the girl under her roof. All the long misery of his\nbaffled past, of his youth of failure, hardship and vain effort, rose\nup in his soul in bitterness and seemed to take shape before him in the\nwoman who at every turn had barred his way. She had taken everything\nelse from him; and now she meant to take the one thing that made up for\nall the others. For a moment such a flame of hate rose in him that it\nran down his arm and clenched his fist against her. He took a wild step\nforward and then stopped.\n\n\"You're--you're not coming down?\" he said in a bewildered voice.\n\n\"No. I guess I'll lay down on the bed a little while,\" she answered\nmildly; and he turned and walked out of the room.\n\nIn the kitchen Mattie was sitting by the stove, the cat curled up on her\nknees. She sprang to her feet as Ethan entered and carried the covered\ndish of meat-pie to the table.\n\n\"I hope Zeena isn't sick?\" she asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe shone at him across the table. \"Well, sit right down then. You must\nbe starving.\" She uncovered the pie and pushed it over to him. So they\nwere to have one more evening together, her happy eyes seemed to say!\n\nHe helped himself mechanically and began to eat; then disgust took him\nby the throat and he laid down his fork.\n\nMattie's tender gaze was on him and she marked the gesture.\n\n\"Why, Ethan, what's the matter? Don't it taste right?\"\n\n\"Yes--it's first-rate. Only I--\" He pushed his plate away, rose from his\nchair, and walked around the table to her side. She started up with\nfrightened eyes.\n\n\"Ethan, there's something wrong! I knew there was!\"\n\nShe seemed to melt against him in her terror, and he caught her in his\narms, held her fast there, felt her lashes beat his cheek like netted\nbutterflies.\n\n\"What is it--what is it?\" she stammered; but he had found her lips at\nlast and was drinking unconsciousness of everything but the joy they\ngave him.\n\nShe lingered a moment, caught in the same strong current; then she\nslipped from him and drew back a step or two, pale and troubled. Her\nlook smote him with compunction, and he cried out, as if he saw her\ndrowning in a dream: \"You can't go, Matt! I'll never let you!\"\n\n\"Go--go?\" she stammered. \"Must I go?\"\n\nThe words went on sounding between them as though a torch of warning\nflew from hand to hand through a black landscape.\n\nEthan was overcome with shame at his lack of self-control in flinging\nthe news at her so brutally. His head reeled and he had to support\nhimself against the table. All the while he felt as if he were still\nkissing her, and yet dying of thirst for her lips.\n\n\"Ethan, what has happened? Is Zeena mad with me?\"\n\nHer cry steadied him, though it deepened his wrath and pity. \"No, no,\"\nhe assured her, \"it's not that. But this new doctor has scared her about\nherself. You know she believes all they say the first time she sees\nthem. And this one's told her she won't get well unless she lays up and\ndon't do a thing about the house--not for months--\"\n\nHe paused, his eyes wandering from her miserably. She stood silent a\nmoment, drooping before him like a broken branch. She was so small and\nweak-looking that it wrung his heart; but suddenly she lifted her head\nand looked straight at him. \"And she wants somebody handier in my place?\nIs that it?\"\n\n\"That's what she says to-night.\"\n\n\"If she says it to-night she'll say it to-morrow.\"\n\nBoth bowed to the inexorable truth: they knew that Zeena never changed\nher mind, and that in her case a resolve once taken was equivalent to an\nact performed.\n\nThere was a long silence between them; then Mattie said in a low voice:\n\"Don't be too sorry, Ethan.\"\n\n\"Oh, God--oh, God,\" he groaned. The glow of passion he had felt for her\nhad melted to an aching tenderness. He saw her quick lids beating back\nthe tears, and longed to take her in his arms and soothe her.\n\n\"You're letting your supper get cold,\" she admonished him with a pale\ngleam of gaiety.\n\n\"Oh, Matt--Matt--where'll you go to?\"\n\nHer lids sank and a tremor crossed her face. He saw that for the first\ntime the thought of the future came to her distinctly. \"I might get\nsomething to do over at Stamford,\" she faltered, as if knowing that he\nknew she had no hope.\n\nHe dropped back into his seat and hid his face in his hands. Despair\nseized him at the thought of her setting out alone to renew the weary\nquest for work. In the only place where she was known she was surrounded\nby indifference or animosity; and what chance had she, inexperienced\nand untrained, among the million bread-seekers of the cities? There came\nback to him miserable tales he had heard at Worcester, and the faces\nof girls whose lives had begun as hopefully as Mattie's.... It was not\npossible to think of such things without a revolt of his whole being. He\nsprang up suddenly.\n\n\"You can't go, Matt! I won't let you! She's always had her way, but I\nmean to have mine now--\"\n\nMattie lifted her hand with a quick gesture, and he heard his wife's\nstep behind him.\n\nZeena came into the room with her dragging down-at-the-heel step, and\nquietly took her accustomed seat between them.\n\n\"I felt a little mite better, and Dr. Buck says I ought to eat all I can\nto keep my strength up, even if I ain't got any appetite,\" she said in\nher flat whine, reaching across Mattie for the teapot. Her \"good\" dress\nhad been replaced by the black calico and brown knitted shawl which\nformed her daily wear, and with them she had put on her usual face and\nmanner. She poured out her tea, added a great deal of milk to it, helped\nherself largely to pie and pickles, and made the familiar gesture of\nadjusting her false teeth before she began to eat. The cat rubbed itself\ningratiatingly against her, and she said \"Good Pussy,\" stooped to stroke\nit and gave it a scrap of meat from her plate.\n\nEthan sat speechless, not pretending to eat, but Mattie nibbled\nvaliantly at her food and asked Zeena one or two questions about her\nvisit to Bettsbridge. Zeena answered in her every-day tone and, warming\nto the theme, regaled them with several vivid descriptions of intestinal\ndisturbances among her friends and relatives. She looked straight at\nMattie as she spoke, a faint smile deepening the vertical lines between\nher nose and chin.\n\nWhen supper was over she rose from her seat and pressed her hand to the\nflat surface over the region of her heart. \"That pie of yours always\nsets a mite heavy, Matt,\" she said, not ill-naturedly. She seldom\nabbreviated the girl's name, and when she did so it was always a sign of\naffability.\n\n\"I've a good mind to go and hunt up those stomach powders I got last\nyear over in Springfield,\" she continued. \"I ain't tried them for quite\na while, and maybe they'll help the heartburn.\"\n\nMattie lifted her eyes. \"Can't I get them for you, Zeena?\" she ventured.\n\n\"No. They're in a place you don't know about,\" Zeena answered darkly,\nwith one of her secret looks.\n\nShe went out of the kitchen and Mattie, rising, began to clear the\ndishes from the table. As she passed Ethan's chair their eyes met and\nclung together desolately. The warm still kitchen looked as peaceful as\nthe night before. The cat had sprung to Zeena's rocking-chair, and the\nheat of the fire was beginning to draw out the faint sharp scent of the\ngeraniums. Ethan dragged himself wearily to his feet.\n\n\"I'll go out and take a look around,\" he said, going toward the passage\nto get his lantern.\n\nAs he reached the door he met Zeena coming back into the room, her lips\ntwitching with anger, a flush of excitement on her sallow face.\nThe shawl had slipped from her shoulders and was dragging at her\ndown-trodden heels, and in her hands she carried the fragments of the\nred glass pickle-dish.\n\n\"I'd like to know who done this,\" she said, looking sternly from Ethan\nto Mattie.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued in a trembling voice: \"I went to\nget those powders I'd put away in father's old spectacle-case, top of\nthe china-closet, where I keep the things I set store by, so's folks\nshan't meddle with them--\" Her voice broke, and two small tears hung\non her lashless lids and ran slowly down her cheeks. \"It takes the\nstepladder to get at the top shelf, and I put Aunt Philura Maple's\npickle-dish up there o' purpose when we was married, and it's never been\ndown since, 'cept for the spring cleaning, and then I always lifted it\nwith my own hands, so's 't it shouldn't get broke.\" She laid the fragments\nreverently on the table. \"I want to know who done this,\" she quavered.\n\nAt the challenge Ethan turned back into the room and faced her. \"I can\ntell you, then. The cat done it.\"\n\n\"The cat?\"\n\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\nShe looked at him hard, and then turned her eyes to Mattie, who was\ncarrying the dish-pan to the table.\n\n\"I'd like to know how the cat got into my china-closet\"' she said.\n\n\"Chasin' mice, I guess,\" Ethan rejoined. \"There was a mouse round the\nkitchen all last evening.\"\n\nZeena continued to look from one to the other; then she emitted her\nsmall strange laugh. \"I knew the cat was a smart cat,\" she said in a\nhigh voice, \"but I didn't know he was smart enough to pick up the pieces\nof my pickle-dish and lay 'em edge to edge on the very shelf he knocked\n'em off of.\"\n\nMattie suddenly drew her arms out of the steaming water. \"It wasn't\nEthan's fault, Zeena! The cat did break the dish; but I got it down from\nthe china-closet, and I'm the one to blame for its getting broken.\"\n\nZeena stood beside the ruin of her treasure, stiffening into a stony\nimage of resentment, \"You got down my pickle-dish-what for?\"\n\nA bright flush flew to Mattie's cheeks. \"I wanted to make the\nsupper-table pretty,\" she said.\n\n\"You wanted to make the supper-table pretty; and you waited till my back\nwas turned, and took the thing I set most store by of anything I've got,\nand wouldn't never use it, not even when the minister come to dinner,\nor Aunt Martha Pierce come over from Bettsbridge--\" Zeena paused with a\ngasp, as if terrified by her own evocation of the sacrilege. \"You're a\nbad girl, Mattie Silver, and I always known it. It's the way your father\nbegun, and I was warned of it when I took you, and I tried to keep my\nthings where you couldn't get at 'em--and now you've took from me the one\nI cared for most of all--\" She broke off in a short spasm of sobs that\npassed and left her more than ever like a shape of stone.\n\n\"If I'd 'a' listened to folks, you'd 'a' gone before now, and this\nwouldn't 'a' happened,\" she said; and gathering up the bits of broken\nglass she went out of the room as if she carried a dead body...\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nWhen Ethan was called back to the farm by his father's illness his\nmother gave him, for his own use, a small room behind the untenanted\n\"best parlour.\" Here he had nailed up shelves for his books, built\nhimself a box-sofa out of boards and a mattress, laid out his papers on\na kitchen-table, hung on the rough plaster wall an engraving of Abraham\nLincoln and a calendar with \"Thoughts from the Poets,\" and tried, with\nthese meagre properties, to produce some likeness to the study of a\n\"minister\" who had been kind to him and lent him books when he was at\nWorcester. He still took refuge there in summer, but when Mattie came to\nlive at the farm he had to give her his stove, and consequently the room\nwas uninhabitable for several months of the year.\n\nTo this retreat he descended as soon as the house was quiet, and Zeena's\nsteady breathing from the bed had assured him that there was to be\nno sequel to the scene in the kitchen. After Zeena's departure he and\nMattie had stood speechless, neither seeking to approach the other. Then\nthe girl had returned to her task of clearing up the kitchen for the\nnight and he had taken his lantern and gone on his usual round outside\nthe house. The kitchen was empty when he came back to it; but his\ntobacco-pouch and pipe had been laid on the table, and under them was\na scrap of paper torn from the back of a seedsman's catalogue, on which\nthree words were written: \"Don't trouble, Ethan.\"\n\nGoing into his cold dark \"study\" he placed the lantern on the table\nand, stooping to its light, read the message again and again. It was the\nfirst time that Mattie had ever written to him, and the possession of\nthe paper gave him a strange new sense of her nearness; yet it deepened\nhis anguish by reminding him that henceforth they would have no other\nway of communicating with each other. For the life of her smile, the\nwarmth of her voice, only cold paper and dead words!\n\nConfused motions of rebellion stormed in him. He was too young, too\nstrong, too full of the sap of living, to submit so easily to the\ndestruction of his hopes. Must he wear out all his years at the side\nof a bitter querulous woman? Other possibilities had been in him,\npossibilities sacrificed, one by one, to Zeena's narrow-mindedness\nand ignorance. And what good had come of it? She was a hundred times\nbitterer and more discontented than when he had married her: the one\npleasure left her was to inflict pain on him. All the healthy instincts\nof self-defence rose up in him against such waste...\n\nHe bundled himself into his old coon-skin coat and lay down on the\nbox-sofa to think. Under his cheek he felt a hard object with strange\nprotuberances. It was a cushion which Zeena had made for him when they\nwere engaged--the only piece of needlework he had ever seen her do. He\nflung it across the floor and propped his head against the wall...\n\nHe knew a case of a man over the mountain--a young fellow of about his\nown age--who had escaped from just such a life of misery by going West\nwith the girl he cared for. His wife had divorced him, and he had\nmarried the girl and prospered. Ethan had seen the couple the summer\nbefore at Shadd's Falls, where they had come to visit relatives. They\nhad a little girl with fair curls, who wore a gold locket and was\ndressed like a princess. The deserted wife had not done badly either.\nHer husband had given her the farm and she had managed to sell it, and\nwith that and the alimony she had started a lunch-room at Bettsbridge\nand bloomed into activity and importance. Ethan was fired by the\nthought. Why should he not leave with Mattie the next day, instead of\nletting her go alone? He would hide his valise under the seat of the\nsleigh, and Zeena would suspect nothing till she went upstairs for her\nafternoon nap and found a letter on the bed...\n\nHis impulses were still near the surface, and he sprang up, re-lit the\nlantern, and sat down at the table. He rummaged in the drawer for a\nsheet of paper, found one, and began to write.\n\n\"Zeena, I've done all I could for you, and I don't see as it's been any\nuse. I don't blame you, nor I don't blame myself. Maybe both of us will\ndo better separate. I'm going to try my luck West, and you can sell the\nfarm and mill, and keep the money--\"\n\nHis pen paused on the word, which brought home to him the relentless\nconditions of his lot. If he gave the farm and mill to Zeena what would\nbe left him to start his own life with? Once in the West he was sure of\npicking up work--he would not have feared to try his chance alone. But\nwith Mattie depending on him the case was different. And what of Zeena's\nfate? Farm and mill were mortgaged to the limit of their value, and even\nif she found a purchaser--in itself an unlikely chance--it was doubtful if\nshe could clear a thousand dollars on the sale. Meanwhile, how could\nshe keep the farm going? It was only by incessant labour and personal\nsupervision that Ethan drew a meagre living from his land, and his wife,\neven if she were in better health than she imagined, could never carry\nsuch a burden alone.\n\nWell, she could go back to her people, then, and see what they would do\nfor her. It was the fate she was forcing on Mattie--why not let her try\nit herself? By the time she had discovered his whereabouts, and brought\nsuit for divorce, he would probably--wherever he was--be earning enough to\npay her a sufficient alimony. And the alternative was to let Mattie go\nforth alone, with far less hope of ultimate provision...\n\nHe had scattered the contents of the table-drawer in his search for a\nsheet of paper, and as he took up his pen his eye fell on an old copy of\nthe Bettsbridge Eagle. The advertising sheet was folded uppermost, and\nhe read the seductive words: \"Trips to the West: Reduced Rates.\"\n\nHe drew the lantern nearer and eagerly scanned the fares; then the paper\nfell from his hand and he pushed aside his unfinished letter. A moment\nago he had wondered what he and Mattie were to live on when they reached\nthe West; now he saw that he had not even the money to take her there.\nBorrowing was out of the question: six months before he had given his\nonly security to raise funds for necessary repairs to the mill, and\nhe knew that without security no one at Starkfield would lend him ten\ndollars. The inexorable facts closed in on him like prison-warders\nhandcuffing a convict. There was no way out--none. He was a prisoner for\nlife, and now his one ray of light was to be extinguished.\n\nHe crept back heavily to the sofa, stretching himself out with limbs so\nleaden that he felt as if they would never move again. Tears rose in his\nthroat and slowly burned their way to his lids.\n\nAs he lay there, the window-pane that faced him, growing gradually\nlighter, inlaid upon the darkness a square of moon-suffused sky. A\ncrooked tree-branch crossed it, a branch of the apple-tree under which,\non summer evenings, he had sometimes found Mattie sitting when he came\nup from the mill. Slowly the rim of the rainy vapours caught fire and\nburnt away, and a pure moon swung into the blue. Ethan, rising on his\nelbow, watched the landscape whiten and shape itself under the sculpture\nof the moon. This was the night on which he was to have taken Mattie\ncoasting, and there hung the lamp to light them! He looked out at the\nslopes bathed in lustre, the silver-edged darkness of the woods, the\nspectral purple of the hills against the sky, and it seemed as\nthough all the beauty of the night had been poured out to mock his\nwretchedness...\n\nHe fell asleep, and when he woke the chill of the winter dawn was in the\nroom. He felt cold and stiff and hungry, and ashamed of being hungry.\nHe rubbed his eyes and went to the window. A red sun stood over the grey\nrim of the fields, behind trees that looked black and brittle. He said\nto himself: \"This is Matt's last day,\" and tried to think what the place\nwould be without her.\n\nAs he stood there he heard a step behind him and she entered.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan--were you here all night?\"\n\nShe looked so small and pinched, in her poor dress, with the red scarf\nwound about her, and the cold light turning her paleness sallow, that\nEthan stood before her without speaking.\n\n\"You must be frozen,\" she went on, fixing lustreless eyes on him.\n\nHe drew a step nearer. \"How did you know I was here?\"\n\n\"Because I heard you go down stairs again after I went to bed, and I\nlistened all night, and you didn't come up.\"\n\nAll his tenderness rushed to his lips. He looked at her and said: \"I'll\ncome right along and make up the kitchen fire.\"\n\nThey went back to the kitchen, and he fetched the coal and kindlings\nand cleared out the stove for her, while she brought in the milk and\nthe cold remains of the meat-pie. When warmth began to radiate from the\nstove, and the first ray of sunlight lay on the kitchen floor, Ethan's\ndark thoughts melted in the mellower air. The sight of Mattie going\nabout her work as he had seen her on so many mornings made it seem\nimpossible that she should ever cease to be a part of the scene. He said\nto himself that he had doubtless exaggerated the significance of Zeena's\nthreats, and that she too, with the return of daylight, would come to a\nsaner mood.\n\nHe went up to Mattie as she bent above the stove, and laid his hand on\nher arm. \"I don't want you should trouble either,\" he said, looking down\ninto her eyes with a smile.\n\nShe flushed up warmly and whispered back: \"No, Ethan, I ain't going to\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I guess things'll straighten out,\" he added.\n\nThere was no answer but a quick throb of her lids, and he went on: \"She\nain't said anything this morning?\"\n\n\"No. I haven't seen her yet.\"\n\n\"Don't you take any notice when you do.\"\n\nWith this injunction he left her and went out to the cow-barn. He saw\nJotham Powell walking up the hill through the morning mist, and the\nfamiliar sight added to his growing conviction of security.\n\nAs the two men were clearing out the stalls Jotham rested on his\npitch-fork to say: \"Dan'l Byrne's goin' over to the Flats to-day noon,\nan' he c'd take Mattie's trunk along, and make it easier ridin' when I\ntake her over in the sleigh.\"\n\nEthan looked at him blankly, and he continued: \"Mis' Frome said the new\ngirl'd be at the Flats at five, and I was to take Mattie then, so's 't\nshe could ketch the six o'clock train for Stamford.\"\n\nEthan felt the blood drumming in his temples. He had to wait a moment\nbefore he could find voice to say: \"Oh, it ain't so sure about Mattie's\ngoing--\"\n\n\"That so?\" said Jotham indifferently; and they went on with their work.\n\nWhen they returned to the kitchen the two women were already at\nbreakfast. Zeena had an air of unusual alertness and activity. She drank\ntwo cups of coffee and fed the cat with the scraps left in the pie-dish;\nthen she rose from her seat and, walking over to the window, snipped two\nor three yellow leaves from the geraniums. \"Aunt Martha's ain't got a\nfaded leaf on 'em; but they pine away when they ain't cared for,\" she\nsaid reflectively. Then she turned to Jotham and asked: \"What time'd you\nsay Dan'l Byrne'd be along?\"\n\nThe hired man threw a hesitating glance at Ethan. \"Round about noon,\" he\nsaid.\n\nZeena turned to Mattie. \"That trunk of yours is too heavy for the\nsleigh, and Dan'l Byrne'll be round to take it over to the Flats,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you, Zeena,\" said Mattie.\n\n\"I'd like to go over things with you first,\" Zeena continued in an\nunperturbed voice. \"I know there's a huckabuck towel missing; and I\ncan't make out what you done with that match-safe 't used to stand\nbehind the stuffed owl in the parlour.\"\n\nShe went out, followed by Mattie, and when the men were alone Jotham\nsaid to his employer: \"I guess I better let Dan'l come round, then.\"\n\nEthan finished his usual morning tasks about the house and barn; then\nhe said to Jotham: \"I'm going down to Starkfield. Tell them not to wait\ndinner.\"\n\nThe passion of rebellion had broken out in him again. That which had\nseemed incredible in the sober light of day had really come to pass,\nand he was to assist as a helpless spectator at Mattie's banishment.\nHis manhood was humbled by the part he was compelled to play and by the\nthought of what Mattie must think of him. Confused impulses struggled\nin him as he strode along to the village. He had made up his mind to do\nsomething, but he did not know what it would be.\n\nThe early mist had vanished and the fields lay like a silver shield\nunder the sun. It was one of the days when the glitter of winter shines\nthrough a pale haze of spring. Every yard of the road was alive with\nMattie's presence, and there was hardly a branch against the sky or a\ntangle of brambles on the bank in which some bright shred of memory was\nnot caught. Once, in the stillness, the call of a bird in a mountain ash\nwas so like her laughter that his heart tightened and then grew large;\nand all these things made him see that something must be done at once.\n\nSuddenly it occurred to him that Andrew Hale, who was a kind-hearted\nman, might be induced to reconsider his refusal and advance a small sum\non the lumber if he were told that Zeena's ill-health made it necessary\nto hire a servant. Hale, after all, knew enough of Ethan's situation\nto make it possible for the latter to renew his appeal without too much\nloss of pride; and, moreover, how much did pride count in the ebullition\nof passions in his breast?\n\nThe more he considered his plan the more hopeful it seemed. If he could\nget Mrs. Hale's ear he felt certain of success, and with fifty dollars\nin his pocket nothing could keep him from Mattie...\n\nHis first object was to reach Starkfield before Hale had started for\nhis work; he knew the carpenter had a job down the Corbury road and was\nlikely to leave his house early. Ethan's long strides grew more rapid\nwith the accelerated beat of his thoughts, and as he reached the foot of\nSchool House Hill he caught sight of Hale's sleigh in the distance. He\nhurried forward to meet it, but as it drew nearer he saw that it was\ndriven by the carpenter's youngest boy and that the figure at his side,\nlooking like a large upright cocoon in spectacles, was that of Mrs.\nHale. Ethan signed to them to stop, and Mrs. Hale leaned forward, her\npink wrinkles twinkling with benevolence.\n\n\"Mr. Hale? Why, yes, you'll find him down home now. He ain't going to\nhis work this forenoon. He woke up with a touch o' lumbago, and I just\nmade him put on one of old Dr. Kidder's plasters and set right up into\nthe fire.\"\n\nBeaming maternally on Ethan, she bent over to add: \"I on'y just heard\nfrom Mr. Hale 'bout Zeena's going over to Bettsbridge to see that new\ndoctor. I'm real sorry she's feeling so bad again! I hope he thinks he\ncan do something for her. I don't know anybody round here's had more\nsickness than Zeena. I always tell Mr. Hale I don't know what she'd 'a'\ndone if she hadn't 'a' had you to look after her; and I used to say\nthe same thing 'bout your mother. You've had an awful mean time, Ethan\nFrome.\"\n\nShe gave him a last nod of sympathy while her son chirped to the horse;\nand Ethan, as she drove off, stood in the middle of the road and stared\nafter the retreating sleigh.\n\nIt was a long time since any one had spoken to him as kindly as Mrs.\nHale. Most people were either indifferent to his troubles, or disposed\nto think it natural that a young fellow of his age should have carried\nwithout repining the burden of three crippled lives. But Mrs. Hale had\nsaid, \"You've had an awful mean time, Ethan Frome,\" and he felt less\nalone with his misery. If the Hales were sorry for him they would surely\nrespond to his appeal...\n\nHe started down the road toward their house, but at the end of a few\nyards he pulled up sharply, the blood in his face. For the first time,\nin the light of the words he had just heard, he saw what he was about to\ndo. He was planning to take advantage of the Hales' sympathy to obtain\nmoney from them on false pretences. That was a plain statement of the\ncloudy purpose which had driven him in headlong to Starkfield.\n\nWith the sudden perception of the point to which his madness had carried\nhim, the madness fell and he saw his life before him as it was. He was a\npoor man, the husband of a sickly woman, whom his desertion would leave\nalone and destitute; and even if he had had the heart to desert her he\ncould have done so only by deceiving two kindly people who had pitied\nhim.\n\nHe turned and walked slowly back to the farm.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nAt the kitchen door Daniel Byrne sat in his sleigh behind a big-boned\ngrey who pawed the snow and swung his long head restlessly from side to\nside.\n\nEthan went into the kitchen and found his wife by the stove. Her head\nwas wrapped in her shawl, and she was reading a book called \"Kidney\nTroubles and Their Cure\" on which he had had to pay extra postage only a\nfew days before.\n\nZeena did not move or look up when he entered, and after a moment he\nasked: \"Where's Mattie?\"\n\nWithout lifting her eyes from the page she replied: \"I presume she's\ngetting down her trunk.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to his face. \"Getting down her trunk--alone?\"\n\n\"Jotham Powell's down in the wood-lot, and Dan'l Byrne says he darsn't\nleave that horse,\" she returned.\n\nHer husband, without stopping to hear the end of the phrase, had left\nthe kitchen and sprung up the stairs. The door of Mattie's room was\nshut, and he wavered a moment on the landing. \"Matt,\" he said in a low\nvoice; but there was no answer, and he put his hand on the door-knob.\n\nHe had never been in her room except once, in the early summer, when\nhe had gone there to plaster up a leak in the eaves, but he remembered\nexactly how everything had looked: the red-and-white quilt on her narrow\nbed, the pretty pin-cushion on the chest of drawers, and over it the\nenlarged photograph of her mother, in an oxydized frame, with a bunch of\ndyed grasses at the back. Now these and all other tokens of her presence\nhad vanished, and the room looked as bare and comfortless as when Zeena\nhad shown her into it on the day of her arrival. In the middle of the\nfloor stood her trunk, and on the trunk she sat in her Sunday dress,\nher back turned to the door and her face in her hands. She had not heard\nEthan's call because she was sobbing and she did not hear his step till\nhe stood close behind her and laid his hands on her shoulders.\n\n\"Matt--oh, don't--oh, Matt!\"\n\nShe started up, lifting her wet face to his. \"Ethan--I thought I wasn't\never going to see you again!\"\n\nHe took her in his arms, pressing her close, and with a trembling hand\nsmoothed away the hair from her forehead.\n\n\"Not see me again? What do you mean?\"\n\nShe sobbed out: \"Jotham said you told him we wasn't to wait dinner for\nyou, and I thought--\"\n\n\"You thought I meant to cut it?\" he finished for her grimly.\n\nShe clung to him without answering, and he laid his lips on her hair,\nwhich was soft yet springy, like certain mosses on warm slopes, and had\nthe faint woody fragrance of fresh sawdust in the sun.\n\nThrough the door they heard Zeena's voice calling out from below: \"Dan'l\nByrne says you better hurry up if you want him to take that trunk.\"\n\nThey drew apart with stricken faces. Words of resistance rushed to\nEthan's lips and died there. Mattie found her handkerchief and dried her\neyes; then, bending down, she took hold of a handle of the trunk.\n\nEthan put her aside. \"You let go, Matt,\" he ordered her.\n\nShe answered: \"It takes two to coax it round the corner\"; and submitting\nto this argument he grasped the other handle, and together they\nmanoeuvred the heavy trunk out to the landing.\n\n\"Now let go,\" he repeated; then he shouldered the trunk and carried it\ndown the stairs and across the passage to the kitchen. Zeena, who had\ngone back to her seat by the stove, did not lift her head from her book\nas he passed. Mattie followed him out of the door and helped him to lift\nthe trunk into the back of the sleigh. When it was in place they stood\nside by side on the door-step, watching Daniel Byrne plunge off behind\nhis fidgety horse.\n\nIt seemed to Ethan that his heart was bound with cords which an unseen\nhand was tightening with every tick of the clock. Twice he opened his\nlips to speak to Mattie and found no breath. At length, as she turned to\nre-enter the house, he laid a detaining hand on her.\n\n\"I'm going to drive you over, Matt,\" he whispered.\n\nShe murmured back: \"I think Zeena wants I should go with Jotham.\"\n\n\"I'm going to drive you over,\" he repeated; and she went into the\nkitchen without answering.\n\nAt dinner Ethan could not eat. If he lifted his eyes they rested on\nZeena's pinched face, and the corners of her straight lips seemed to\nquiver away into a smile. She ate well, declaring that the mild weather\nmade her feel better, and pressed a second helping of beans on Jotham\nPowell, whose wants she generally ignored.\n\nMattie, when the meal was over, went about her usual task of clearing\nthe table and washing up the dishes. Zeena, after feeding the cat,\nhad returned to her rocking-chair by the stove, and Jotham Powell, who\nalways lingered last, reluctantly pushed back his chair and moved toward\nthe door.\n\nOn the threshold he turned back to say to Ethan: \"What time'll I come\nround for Mattie?\"\n\nEthan was standing near the window, mechanically filling his pipe while\nhe watched Mattie move to and fro. He answered: \"You needn't come round;\nI'm going to drive her over myself.\"\n\nHe saw the rise of the colour in Mattie's averted cheek, and the quick\nlifting of Zeena's head.\n\n\"I want you should stay here this afternoon, Ethan,\" his wife said.\n\"Jotham can drive Mattie over.\"\n\nMattie flung an imploring glance at him, but he repeated curtly: \"I'm\ngoing to drive her over myself.\"\n\nZeena continued in the same even tone: \"I wanted you should stay and fix\nup that stove in Mattie's room afore the girl gets here. It ain't been\ndrawing right for nigh on a month now.\"\n\nEthan's voice rose indignantly. \"If it was good enough for Mattie I\nguess it's good enough for a hired girl.\"\n\n\"That girl that's coming told me she was used to a house where they had\na furnace,\" Zeena persisted with the same monotonous mildness.\n\n\"She'd better ha' stayed there then,\" he flung back at her; and turning\nto Mattie he added in a hard voice: \"You be ready by three, Matt; I've\ngot business at Corbury.\"\n\nJotham Powell had started for the barn, and Ethan strode down after him\naflame with anger. The pulses in his temples throbbed and a fog was in\nhis eyes. He went about his task without knowing what force directed\nhim, or whose hands and feet were fulfilling its orders. It was not till\nhe led out the sorrel and backed him between the shafts of the sleigh\nthat he once more became conscious of what he was doing. As he passed\nthe bridle over the horse's head, and wound the traces around the\nshafts, he remembered the day when he had made the same preparations\nin order to drive over and meet his wife's cousin at the Flats. It\nwas little more than a year ago, on just such a soft afternoon, with a\n\"feel\" of spring in the air. The sorrel, turning the same big ringed eye\non him, nuzzled the palm of his hand in the same way; and one by one all\nthe days between rose up and stood before him...\n\nHe flung the bearskin into the sleigh, climbed to the seat, and drove up\nto the house. When he entered the kitchen it was empty, but Mattie's bag\nand shawl lay ready by the door. He went to the foot of the stairs and\nlistened. No sound reached him from above, but presently he thought he\nheard some one moving about in his deserted study, and pushing open the\ndoor he saw Mattie, in her hat and jacket, standing with her back to him\nnear the table.\n\nShe started at his approach and turning quickly, said: \"Is it time?\"\n\n\"What are you doing here, Matt?\" he asked her.\n\nShe looked at him timidly. \"I was just taking a look round--that's all,\"\nshe answered, with a wavering smile.\n\nThey went back into the kitchen without speaking, and Ethan picked up\nher bag and shawl.\n\n\"Where's Zeena?\" he asked.\n\n\"She went upstairs right after dinner. She said she had those shooting\npains again, and didn't want to be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say good-bye to you?\"\n\n\"No. That was all she said.\"\n\nEthan, looking slowly about the kitchen, said to himself with a shudder\nthat in a few hours he would be returning to it alone. Then the sense\nof unreality overcame him once more, and he could not bring himself to\nbelieve that Mattie stood there for the last time before him.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said almost gaily, opening the door and putting her bag\ninto the sleigh. He sprang to his seat and bent over to tuck the rug\nabout her as she slipped into the place at his side. \"Now then, go\n'long,\" he said, with a shake of the reins that sent the sorrel placidly\njogging down the hill.\n\n\"We got lots of time for a good ride, Matt!\" he cried, seeking her hand\nbeneath the fur and pressing it in his. His face tingled and he felt\ndizzy, as if he had stopped in at the Starkfield saloon on a zero day\nfor a drink.\n\nAt the gate, instead of making for Starkfield, he turned the sorrel to\nthe right, up the Bettsbridge road. Mattie sat silent, giving no sign\nof surprise; but after a moment she said: \"Are you going round by Shadow\nPond?\"\n\nHe laughed and answered: \"I knew you'd know!\"\n\nShe drew closer under the bearskin, so that, looking sideways around his\ncoat-sleeve, he could just catch the tip of her nose and a blown brown\nwave of hair. They drove slowly up the road between fields glistening\nunder the pale sun, and then bent to the right down a lane edged with\nspruce and larch. Ahead of them, a long way off, a range of hills\nstained by mottlings of black forest flowed away in round white curves\nagainst the sky. The lane passed into a pine-wood with boles reddening\nin the afternoon sun and delicate blue shadows on the snow. As they\nentered it the breeze fell and a warm stillness seemed to drop from the\nbranches with the dropping needles. Here the snow was so pure that the\ntiny tracks of wood-animals had left on it intricate lace-like patterns,\nand the bluish cones caught in its surface stood out like ornaments of\nbronze.\n\nEthan drove on in silence till they reached a part of the wood where the\npines were more widely spaced; then he drew up and helped Mattie to get\nout of the sleigh. They passed between the aromatic trunks, the snow\nbreaking crisply under their feet, till they came to a small sheet\nof water with steep wooded sides. Across its frozen surface, from the\nfarther bank, a single hill rising against the western sun threw the\nlong conical shadow which gave the lake its name. It was a shy secret\nspot, full of the same dumb melancholy that Ethan felt in his heart.\n\nHe looked up and down the little pebbly beach till his eye lit on a\nfallen tree-trunk half submerged in snow.\n\n\"There's where we sat at the picnic,\" he reminded her.\n\nThe entertainment of which he spoke was one of the few that they had\ntaken part in together: a \"church picnic\" which, on a long afternoon of\nthe preceding summer, had filled the retired place with merry-making.\nMattie had begged him to go with her but he had refused. Then, toward\nsunset, coming down from the mountain where he had been felling timber,\nhe had been caught by some strayed revellers and drawn into the group by\nthe lake, where Mattie, encircled by facetious youths, and bright as\na blackberry under her spreading hat, was brewing coffee over a gipsy\nfire. He remembered the shyness he had felt at approaching her in his\nuncouth clothes, and then the lighting up of her face, and the way she\nhad broken through the group to come to him with a cup in her hand. They\nhad sat for a few minutes on the fallen log by the pond, and she had\nmissed her gold locket, and set the young men searching for it; and it\nwas Ethan who had spied it in the moss.... That was all; but all their\nintercourse had been made up of just such inarticulate flashes, when\nthey seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a\nbutterfly in the winter woods...\n\n\"It was right there I found your locket,\" he said, pushing his foot into\na dense tuft of blueberry bushes.\n\n\"I never saw anybody with such sharp eyes!\" she answered.\n\nShe sat down on the tree-trunk in the sun and he sat down beside her.\n\n\"You were as pretty as a picture in that pink hat,\" he said.\n\nShe laughed with pleasure. \"Oh, I guess it was the hat!\" she rejoined.\n\nThey had never before avowed their inclination so openly, and Ethan, for\na moment, had the illusion that he was a free man, wooing the girl he\nmeant to marry. He looked at her hair and longed to touch it again, and\nto tell her that it smelt of the woods; but he had never learned to say\nsuch things.\n\nSuddenly she rose to her feet and said: \"We mustn't stay here any\nlonger.\"\n\nHe continued to gaze at her vaguely, only half-roused from his dream.\n\"There's plenty of time,\" he answered.\n\nThey stood looking at each other as if the eyes of each were straining\nto absorb and hold fast the other's image. There were things he had to\nsay to her before they parted, but he could not say them in that place\nof summer memories, and he turned and followed her in silence to\nthe sleigh. As they drove away the sun sank behind the hill and the\npine-boles turned from red to grey.\n\nBy a devious track between the fields they wound back to the Starkfield\nroad. Under the open sky the light was still clear, with a reflection of\ncold red on the eastern hills. The clumps of trees in the snow seemed to\ndraw together in ruffled lumps, like birds with their heads under their\nwings; and the sky, as it paled, rose higher, leaving the earth more\nalone.\n\nAs they turned into the Starkfield road Ethan said: \"Matt, what do you\nmean to do?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once, but at length she said: \"I'll try to get a\nplace in a store.\"\n\n\"You know you can't do it. The bad air and the standing all day nearly\nkilled you before.\"\n\n\"I'm a lot stronger than I was before I came to Starkfield.\"\n\n\"And now you're going to throw away all the good it's done you!\"\n\nThere seemed to be no answer to this, and again they drove on for a\nwhile without speaking. With every yard of the way some spot where they\nhad stood, and laughed together or been silent, clutched at Ethan and\ndragged him back.\n\n\"Isn't there any of your father's folks could help you?\"\n\n\"There isn't any of 'em I'd ask.\"\n\nHe lowered his voice to say: \"You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for\nyou if I could.\"\n\n\"I know there isn't.\"\n\n\"But I can't--\"\n\nShe was silent, but he felt a slight tremor in the shoulder against his.\n\n\"Oh, Matt,\" he broke out, \"if I could ha' gone with you now I'd ha' done\nit--\"\n\nShe turned to him, pulling a scrap of paper from her breast. \"Ethan--I\nfound this,\" she stammered. Even in the failing light he saw it was the\nletter to his wife that he had begun the night before and forgotten\nto destroy. Through his astonishment there ran a fierce thrill of joy.\n\"Matt--\" he cried; \"if I could ha' done it, would you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, Ethan--what's the use?\" With a sudden movement she tore the\nletter in shreds and sent them fluttering off into the snow.\n\n\"Tell me, Matt! Tell me!\" he adjured her.\n\nShe was silent for a moment; then she said, in such a low tone that he\nhad to stoop his head to hear her: \"I used to think of it sometimes,\nsummer nights when the moon was so bright. I couldn't sleep.\"\n\nHis heart reeled with the sweetness of it. \"As long ago as that?\"\n\nShe answered, as if the date had long been fixed for her: \"The first\ntime was at Shadow Pond.\"\n\n\"Was that why you gave me my coffee before the others?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Did I? I was dreadfully put out when you wouldn't go to\nthe picnic with me; and then, when I saw you coming down the road, I\nthought maybe you'd gone home that way o' purpose; and that made me\nglad.\"\n\nThey were silent again. They had reached the point where the road\ndipped to the hollow by Ethan's mill and as they descended the darkness\ndescended with them, dropping down like a black veil from the heavy\nhemlock boughs.\n\n\"I'm tied hand and foot, Matt. There isn't a thing I can do,\" he began\nagain.\n\n\"You must write to me sometimes, Ethan.\"\n\n\"Oh, what good'll writing do? I want to put my hand out and touch you. I\nwant to do for you and care for you. I want to be there when you're sick\nand when you're lonesome.\"\n\n\"You mustn't think but what I'll do all right.\"\n\n\"You won't need me, you mean? I suppose you'll marry!\"\n\n\"Oh, Ethan!\" she cried.\n\n\"I don't know how it is you make me feel, Matt. I'd a'most rather have\nyou dead than that!\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish I was, I wish I was!\" she sobbed.\n\nThe sound of her weeping shook him out of his dark anger, and he felt\nashamed.\n\n\"Don't let's talk that way,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we, when it's true? I've been wishing it every minute of\nthe day.\"\n\n\"Matt! You be quiet! Don't you say it.\"\n\n\"There's never anybody been good to me but you.\"\n\n\"Don't say that either, when I can't lift a hand for you!\"\n\n\"Yes; but it's true just the same.\"\n\nThey had reached the top of School House Hill and Starkfield lay below\nthem in the twilight. A cutter, mounting the road from the village,\npassed them by in a joyous flutter of bells, and they straightened\nthemselves and looked ahead with rigid faces. Along the main street\nlights had begun to shine from the house-fronts and stray figures were\nturning in here and there at the gates. Ethan, with a touch of his whip,\nroused the sorrel to a languid trot.\n\nAs they drew near the end of the village the cries of children reached\nthem, and they saw a knot of boys, with sleds behind them, scattering\nacross the open space before the church.\n\n\"I guess this'll be their last coast for a day or two,\" Ethan said,\nlooking up at the mild sky.\n\nMattie was silent, and he added: \"We were to have gone down last night.\"\n\nStill she did not speak and, prompted by an obscure desire to\nhelp himself and her through their miserable last hour, he went on\ndiscursively: \"Ain't it funny we haven't been down together but just\nthat once last winter?\"\n\nShe answered: \"It wasn't often I got down to the village.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" he said.\n\nThey had reached the crest of the Corbury road, and between the\nindistinct white glimmer of the church and the black curtain of the\nVarnum spruces the slope stretched away below them without a sled on its\nlength. Some erratic impulse prompted Ethan to say: \"How'd you like me\nto take you down now?\"\n\nShe forced a laugh. \"Why, there isn't time!\"\n\n\"There's all the time we want. Come along!\" His one desire now was to\npostpone the moment of turning the sorrel toward the Flats.\n\n\"But the girl,\" she faltered. \"The girl'll be waiting at the station.\"\n\n\"Well, let her wait. You'd have to if she didn't. Come!\"\n\nThe note of authority in his voice seemed to subdue her, and when he\nhad jumped from the sleigh she let him help her out, saying only, with a\nvague feint of reluctance: \"But there isn't a sled round anywheres.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is! Right over there under the spruces.\" He threw the\nbearskin over the sorrel, who stood passively by the roadside, hanging\na meditative head. Then he caught Mattie's hand and drew her after him\ntoward the sled.\n\nShe seated herself obediently and he took his place behind her, so close\nthat her hair brushed his face. \"All right, Matt?\" he called out, as if\nthe width of the road had been between them.\n\nShe turned her head to say: \"It's dreadfully dark. Are you sure you can\nsee?\"\n\nHe laughed contemptuously: \"I could go down this coast with my\neyes tied!\" and she laughed with him, as if she liked his audacity.\nNevertheless he sat still a moment, straining his eyes down the long\nhill, for it was the most confusing hour of the evening, the hour when\nthe last clearness from the upper sky is merged with the rising night in\na blur that disguises landmarks and falsifies distances.\n\n\"Now!\" he cried.\n\nThe sled started with a bound, and they flew on through the dusk,\ngathering smoothness and speed as they went, with the hollow night\nopening out below them and the air singing by like an organ. Mattie sat\nperfectly still, but as they reached the bend at the foot of the hill,\nwhere the big elm thrust out a deadly elbow, he fancied that she shrank\na little closer.\n\n\"Don't be scared, Matt!\" he cried exultantly, as they spun safely past\nit and flew down the second slope; and when they reached the level\nground beyond, and the speed of the sled began to slacken, he heard her\ngive a little laugh of glee.\n\nThey sprang off and started to walk back up the hill. Ethan dragged the\nsled with one hand and passed the other through Mattie's arm.\n\n\"Were you scared I'd run you into the elm?\" he asked with a boyish\nlaugh.\n\n\"I told you I was never scared with you,\" she answered.\n\nThe strange exaltation of his mood had brought on one of his rare fits\nof boastfulness. \"It is a tricky place, though. The least swerve,\nand we'd never ha' come up again. But I can measure distances to a\nhair's-breadth--always could.\"\n\nShe murmured: \"I always say you've got the surest eye...\"\n\nDeep silence had fallen with the starless dusk, and they leaned on each\nother without speaking; but at every step of their climb Ethan said to\nhimself: \"It's the last time we'll ever walk together.\"\n\nThey mounted slowly to the top of the hill. When they were abreast of\nthe church he stooped his head to her to ask: \"Are you tired?\" and she\nanswered, breathing quickly: \"It was splendid!\"\n\nWith a pressure of his arm he guided her toward the Norway spruces. \"I\nguess this sled must be Ned Hale's. Anyhow I'll leave it where I found\nit.\" He drew the sled up to the Varnum gate and rested it against the\nfence. As he raised himself he suddenly felt Mattie close to him among\nthe shadows.\n\n\"Is this where Ned and Ruth kissed each other?\" she whispered\nbreathlessly, and flung her arms about him. Her lips, groping for his,\nswept over his face, and he held her fast in a rapture of surprise.\n\n\"Good-bye-good-bye,\" she stammered, and kissed him again.\n\n\"Oh, Matt, I can't let you go!\" broke from him in the same old cry.\n\nShe freed herself from his hold and he heard her sobbing. \"Oh, I can't\ngo either!\" she wailed.\n\n\"Matt! What'll we do? What'll we do?\"\n\nThey clung to each other's hands like children, and her body shook with\ndesperate sobs.\n\nThrough the stillness they heard the church clock striking five.\n\n\"Oh, Ethan, it's time!\" she cried.\n\nHe drew her back to him. \"Time for what? You don't suppose I'm going to\nleave you now?\"\n\n\"If I missed my train where'd I go?\"\n\n\"Where are you going if you catch it?\"\n\nShe stood silent, her hands lying cold and relaxed in his.\n\n\"What's the good of either of us going anywheres without the other one\nnow?\" he said.\n\nShe remained motionless, as if she had not heard him. Then she snatched\nher hands from his, threw her arms about his neck, and pressed a sudden\ndrenched cheek against his face. \"Ethan! Ethan! I want you to take me\ndown again!\"\n\n\"Down where?\"\n\n\"The coast. Right off,\" she panted. \"So 't we'll never come up any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Matt! What on earth do you mean?\"\n\nShe put her lips close against his ear to say: \"Right into the big elm.\nYou said you could. So 't we'd never have to leave each other any more.\"\n\n\"Why, what are you talking of? You're crazy!\"\n\n\"I'm not crazy; but I will be if I leave you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Matt, Matt--\" he groaned.\n\nShe tightened her fierce hold about his neck. Her face lay close to his\nface.\n\n\"Ethan, where'll I go if I leave you? I don't know how to get along\nalone. You said so yourself just now. Nobody but you was ever good to\nme. And there'll be that strange girl in the house... and she'll sleep\nin my bed, where I used to lay nights and listen to hear you come up the\nstairs...\"\n\nThe words were like fragments torn from his heart. With them came the\nhated vision of the house he was going back to--of the stairs he would\nhave to go up every night, of the woman who would wait for him there.\nAnd the sweetness of Mattie's avowal, the wild wonder of knowing at\nlast that all that had happened to him had happened to her too, made the\nother vision more abhorrent, the other life more intolerable to return\nto...\n\nHer pleadings still came to him between short sobs, but he no longer\nheard what she was saying. Her hat had slipped back and he was stroking\nher hair. He wanted to get the feeling of it into his hand, so that it\nwould sleep there like a seed in winter. Once he found her mouth again,\nand they seemed to be by the pond together in the burning August sun.\nBut his cheek touched hers, and it was cold and full of weeping, and he\nsaw the road to the Flats under the night and heard the whistle of the\ntrain up the line.\n\nThe spruces swathed them in blackness and silence. They might have been\nin their coffins underground. He said to himself: \"Perhaps it'll feel\nlike this...\" and then again: \"After this I sha'n't feel anything...\"\n\nSuddenly he heard the old sorrel whinny across the road, and thought:\n\"He's wondering why he doesn't get his supper...\"\n\n\"Come!\" Mattie whispered, tugging at his hand.\n\nHer sombre violence constrained him: she seemed the embodied instrument\nof fate. He pulled the sled out, blinking like a night-bird as he passed\nfrom the shade of the spruces into the transparent dusk of the open. The\nslope below them was deserted. All Starkfield was at supper, and not a\nfigure crossed the open space before the church. The sky, swollen with\nthe clouds that announce a thaw, hung as low as before a summer storm.\nHe strained his eyes through the dimness, and they seemed less keen,\nless capable than usual.\n\nHe took his seat on the sled and Mattie instantly placed herself in\nfront of him. Her hat had fallen into the snow and his lips were in her\nhair. He stretched out his legs, drove his heels into the road to keep\nthe sled from slipping forward, and bent her head back between his\nhands. Then suddenly he sprang up again.\n\n\"Get up,\" he ordered her.\n\nIt was the tone she always heeded, but she cowered down in her seat,\nrepeating vehemently: \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want to sit in front.\"\n\n\"No, no! How can you steer in front?\"\n\n\"I don't have to. We'll follow the track.\"\n\nThey spoke in smothered whispers, as though the night were listening.\n\n\"Get up! Get up!\" he urged her; but she kept on repeating: \"Why do you\nwant to sit in front?\"\n\n\"Because I--because I want to feel you holding me,\" he stammered, and\ndragged her to her feet.\n\nThe answer seemed to satisfy her, or else she yielded to the power of\nhis voice. He bent down, feeling in the obscurity for the glassy slide\nworn by preceding coasters, and placed the runners carefully between its\nedges. She waited while he seated himself with crossed legs in the front\nof the sled; then she crouched quickly down at his back and clasped her\narms about him. Her breath in his neck set him shuddering again, and\nhe almost sprang from his seat. But in a flash he remembered the\nalternative. She was right: this was better than parting. He leaned back\nand drew her mouth to his...\n\nJust as they started he heard the sorrel's whinny again, and the\nfamiliar wistful call, and all the confused images it brought with it,\nwent with him down the first reach of the road. Half-way down there\nwas a sudden drop, then a rise, and after that another long delirious\ndescent. As they took wing for this it seemed to him that they were\nflying indeed, flying far up into the cloudy night, with Starkfield\nimmeasurably below them, falling away like a speck in space... Then the\nbig elm shot up ahead, lying in wait for them at the bend of the road,\nand he said between his teeth: \"We can fetch it; I know we can fetch\nit--\"\n\nAs they flew toward the tree Mattie pressed her arms tighter, and her\nblood seemed to be in his veins. Once or twice the sled swerved a little\nunder them. He slanted his body to keep it headed for the elm, repeating\nto himself again and again: \"I know we can fetch it\"; and little phrases\nshe had spoken ran through his head and danced before him on the air.\nThe big tree loomed bigger and closer, and as they bore down on it\nhe thought: \"It's waiting for us: it seems to know.\" But suddenly his\nwife's face, with twisted monstrous lineaments, thrust itself between\nhim and his goal, and he made an instinctive movement to brush it aside.\nThe sled swerved in response, but he righted it again, kept it straight,\nand drove down on the black projecting mass. There was a last instant\nwhen the air shot past him like millions of fiery wires; and then the\nelm...\n\nThe sky was still thick, but looking straight up he saw a single star,\nand tried vaguely to reckon whether it were Sirius, or--or--The effort\ntired him too much, and he closed his heavy lids and thought that he\nwould sleep... The stillness was so profound that he heard a little\nanimal twittering somewhere near by under the snow. It made a small\nfrightened cheep like a field mouse, and he wondered languidly if\nit were hurt. Then he understood that it must be in pain: pain so\nexcruciating that he seemed, mysteriously, to feel it shooting through\nhis own body. He tried in vain to roll over in the direction of the\nsound, and stretched his left arm out across the snow. And now it was as\nthough he felt rather than heard the twittering; it seemed to be under\nhis palm, which rested on something soft and springy. The thought of\nthe animal's suffering was intolerable to him and he struggled to raise\nhimself, and could not because a rock, or some huge mass, seemed to be\nlying on him. But he continued to finger about cautiously with his left\nhand, thinking he might get hold of the little creature and help it; and\nall at once he knew that the soft thing he had touched was Mattie's hair\nand that his hand was on her face.\n\nHe dragged himself to his knees, the monstrous load on him moving with\nhim as he moved, and his hand went over and over her face, and he felt\nthat the twittering came from her lips...\n\nHe got his face down close to hers, with his ear to her mouth, and in\nthe darkness he saw her eyes open and heard her say his name.\n\n\"Oh, Matt, I thought we'd fetched it,\" he moaned; and far off, up the\nhill, he heard the sorrel whinny, and thought: \"I ought to be getting\nhim his feed...\"\n\n\n*****\n\n\nTHE QUERULOUS DRONE ceased as I entered Frome's kitchen, and of the two\nwomen sitting there I could not tell which had been the speaker.\n\nOne of them, on my appearing, raised her tall bony figure from her seat,\nnot as if to welcome me--for she threw me no more than a brief glance\nof surprise--but simply to set about preparing the meal which Frome's\nabsence had delayed. A slatternly calico wrapper hung from her shoulders\nand the wisps of her thin grey hair were drawn away from a high forehead\nand fastened at the back by a broken comb. She had pale opaque eyes\nwhich revealed nothing and reflected nothing, and her narrow lips were\nof the same sallow colour as her face.\n\nThe other woman was much smaller and slighter. She sat huddled in an\narm-chair near the stove, and when I came in she turned her head quickly\ntoward me, without the least corresponding movement of her body.\nHer hair was as grey as her companion's, her face as bloodless and\nshrivelled, but amber-tinted, with swarthy shadows sharpening the nose\nand hollowing the temples. Under her shapeless dress her body kept its\nlimp immobility, and her dark eyes had the bright witch-like stare that\ndisease of the spine sometimes gives.\n\nEven for that part of the country the kitchen was a poor-looking place.\nWith the exception of the dark-eyed woman's chair, which looked like a\nsoiled relic of luxury bought at a country auction, the furniture was of\nthe roughest kind. Three coarse china plates and a broken-nosed milk-jug\nhad been set on a greasy table scored with knife-cuts, and a couple\nof straw-bottomed chairs and a kitchen dresser of unpainted pine stood\nmeagrely against the plaster walls.\n\n\"My, it's cold here! The fire must be 'most out,\" Frome said, glancing\nabout him apologetically as he followed me in.\n\nThe tall woman, who had moved away from us toward the dresser, took no\nnotice; but the other, from her cushioned niche, answered complainingly,\nin a high thin voice. \"It's on'y just been made up this very minute.\nZeena fell asleep and slep' ever so long, and I thought I'd be frozen\nstiff before I could wake her up and get her to 'tend to it.\"\n\nI knew then that it was she who had been speaking when we entered.\n\nHer companion, who was just coming back to the table with the remains\nof a cold mince-pie in a battered pie-dish, set down her unappetising\nburden without appearing to hear the accusation brought against her.\n\nFrome stood hesitatingly before her as she advanced; then he looked at\nme and said: \"This is my wife, Mis' Frome.\" After another interval he\nadded, turning toward the figure in the arm-chair: \"And this is Miss\nMattie Silver...\"\n\n\n*****\n\n\nMrs. Hale, tender soul, had pictured me as lost in the Flats and buried\nunder a snow-drift; and so lively was her satisfaction on seeing me\nsafely restored to her the next morning that I felt my peril had caused\nme to advance several degrees in her favour.\n\nGreat was her amazement, and that of old Mrs. Varnum, on learning that\nEthan Frome's old horse had carried me to and from Corbury Junction\nthrough the worst blizzard of the winter; greater still their surprise\nwhen they heard that his master had taken me in for the night.\n\nBeneath their wondering exclamations I felt a secret curiosity to know\nwhat impressions I had received from my night in the Frome household,\nand divined that the best way of breaking down their reserve was to let\nthem try to penetrate mine. I therefore confined myself to saying, in a\nmatter-of-fact tone, that I had been received with great kindness, and\nthat Frome had made a bed for me in a room on the ground-floor which\nseemed in happier days to have been fitted up as a kind of writing-room\nor study.\n\n\"Well,\" Mrs. Hale mused, \"in such a storm I suppose he felt he couldn't\ndo less than take you in--but I guess it went hard with Ethan. I don't\nbelieve but what you're the only stranger has set foot in that house for\nover twenty years. He's that proud he don't even like his oldest friends\nto go there; and I don't know as any do, any more, except myself and the\ndoctor...\"\n\n\"You still go there, Mrs. Hale?\" I ventured.\n\n\"I used to go a good deal after the accident, when I was first married;\nbut after awhile I got to think it made 'em feel worse to see us. And\nthen one thing and another came, and my own troubles... But I generally\nmake out to drive over there round about New Year's, and once in the\nsummer. Only I always try to pick a day when Ethan's off somewheres.\nIt's bad enough to see the two women sitting there--but his face, when he\nlooks round that bare place, just kills me... You see, I can look back\nand call it up in his mother's day, before their troubles.\"\n\nOld Mrs. Varnum, by this time, had gone up to bed, and her daughter\nand I were sitting alone, after supper, in the austere seclusion of\nthe horse-hair parlour. Mrs. Hale glanced at me tentatively, as though\ntrying to see how much footing my conjectures gave her; and I guessed\nthat if she had kept silence till now it was because she had been\nwaiting, through all the years, for some one who should see what she\nalone had seen.\n\nI waited to let her trust in me gather strength before I said: \"Yes,\nit's pretty bad, seeing all three of them there together.\"\n\nShe drew her mild brows into a frown of pain. \"It was just awful from\nthe beginning. I was here in the house when they were carried up--they\nlaid Mattie Silver in the room you're in. She and I were great friends,\nand she was to have been my bridesmaid in the spring... When she came\nto I went up to her and stayed all night. They gave her things to quiet\nher, and she didn't know much till to'rd morning, and then all of a\nsudden she woke up just like herself, and looked straight at me out\nof her big eyes, and said... Oh, I don't know why I'm telling you all\nthis,\" Mrs. Hale broke off, crying.\n\nShe took off her spectacles, wiped the moisture from them, and put them\non again with an unsteady hand. \"It got about the next day,\" she went\non, \"that Zeena Frome had sent Mattie off in a hurry because she had a\nhired girl coming, and the folks here could never rightly tell what she\nand Ethan were doing that night coasting, when they'd ought to have been\non their way to the Flats to ketch the train... I never knew myself\nwhat Zeena thought--I don't to this day. Nobody knows Zeena's thoughts.\nAnyhow, when she heard o' the accident she came right in and stayed with\nEthan over to the minister's, where they'd carried him. And as soon as\nthe doctors said that Mattie could be moved, Zeena sent for her and took\nher back to the farm.\"\n\n\"And there she's been ever since?\"\n\nMrs. Hale answered simply: \"There was nowhere else for her to go;\" and\nmy heart tightened at the thought of the hard compulsions of the poor.\n\n\"Yes, there she's been,\" Mrs. Hale continued, \"and Zeena's done for her,\nand done for Ethan, as good as she could. It was a miracle, considering\nhow sick she was--but she seemed to be raised right up just when the call\ncame to her. Not as she's ever given up doctoring, and she's had sick\nspells right along; but she's had the strength given her to care for\nthose two for over twenty years, and before the accident came she\nthought she couldn't even care for herself.\"\n\nMrs. Hale paused a moment, and I remained silent, plunged in the vision\nof what her words evoked. \"It's horrible for them all,\" I murmured.\n\n\"Yes: it's pretty bad. And they ain't any of 'em easy people either.\nMattie was, before the accident; I never knew a sweeter nature. But\nshe's suffered too much--that's what I always say when folks tell me how\nshe's soured. And Zeena, she was always cranky. Not but what she bears\nwith Mattie wonderful--I've seen that myself. But sometimes the two\nof them get going at each other, and then Ethan's face'd break your\nheart... When I see that, I think it's him that suffers most... anyhow\nit ain't Zeena, because she ain't got the time... It's a pity, though,\"\nMrs. Hale ended, sighing, \"that they're all shut up there'n that one\nkitchen. In the summertime, on pleasant days, they move Mattie into\nthe parlour, or out in the door-yard, and that makes it easier... but\nwinters there's the fires to be thought of; and there ain't a dime to\nspare up at the Fromes.'\"\n\nMrs. Hale drew a deep breath, as though her memory were eased of its\nlong burden, and she had no more to say; but suddenly an impulse of\ncomplete avowal seized her.\n\nShe took off her spectacles again, leaned toward me across the bead-work\ntable-cover, and went on with lowered voice: \"There was one day, about\na week after the accident, when they all thought Mattie couldn't live.\nWell, I say it's a pity she did. I said it right out to our minister\nonce, and he was shocked at me. Only he wasn't with me that morning\nwhen she first came to... And I say, if she'd ha' died, Ethan might ha'\nlived; and the way they are now, I don't see's there's much difference\nbetween the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard;\n'cept that down there they're all quiet, and the women have got to hold\ntheir tongues.\"", "title": "Ethan Frome"}
