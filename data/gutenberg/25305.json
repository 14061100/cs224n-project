{"summary": "The book is written as a series of letters from Frances \"Fanny\" Hill to an unknown woman, with Fanny justifying her life-choices to this individual. At the beginning of her tale, Fanny Hill is a young girl with a rudimentary education living in a small village near Liverpool. Shortly after she turns 15, both her parents die. Esther Davis, a girl from Fanny's village who has since moved to London, convinces Fanny to move to the city as well, but Esther abandons Fanny once they arrive. Fanny hopes to find work as a maid, and is hired by Mrs. Brown, a woman she believes to be a wealthy lady. Mrs. Brown is in fact a madam (pimp) and intends the innocent Fanny to work for her as a prostitute. Mrs. Brown's associate, Phoebe Ayers, shares a bed with Fanny and introduces her to sexual pleasure while establishing that her hymen is intact. Mrs. Brown plans to sell Fanny's virginity to an ugly old man, but Fanny is repulsed by the man and struggles with him. She is saved from rape by Mrs. Brown's maid. After this ordeal, Fanny falls into a fever for several days. Mrs. Brown, realizing that Fanny's virginity is still intact, decides to sell Fanny's sexual favors to the exceedingly rich Lord B., who is due to arrive in a few weeks.\nFanny spies on Mrs. Brown having sex with a large, muscular man. Fanny masturbates while watching them, but is also frightened by the size of the man's penis. She talks to Phoebe, who assures her that it is possible for a young girl to have sex with a well-endowed man. She takes Fanny to spy on another prostitute, Polly Phillips, having sex with a handsome and well-endowed young Genovese merchant. Afterward, Phoebe and Fanny engage in mutual masturbation and Fanny looks forward to her first time having sex with a man.\nSoon afterward, Fanny meets Charles, a 19-year-old wealthy nobleman, and they fall in love instantly. Charles helps Fanny escape the brothel the next day. They go to an inn outside London, where Fanny has sex with Charles for several days. Charles takes Fanny to his flat at St. James's, London, and introduces her to his landlady, Mrs. Jones. For many months, Charles visits Fanny almost daily to have sex. Fanny works hard to become more educated and urbane. After eight months, Fanny becomes pregnant. Three months later, Charles mysteriously disappears. Mrs. Jones learns that Charles' father has kidnapped Charles and sent him to the South Seas to win a fortune. Upset by the news that Charles will be gone for at least three years, Fanny miscarries and falls ill. She is nursed back to health by Mrs. Jones, but sinks into a deep depression.\nMrs. Jones tells Fanny that the now-16-year-old girl must work as a prostitute for her. Mrs. Jones introduces Fanny to Mr. H, a tall, rich, muscular, hairy-chested man. Fanny unwittingly drinks an aphrodisiac, and has sex with Mr. H. She concludes that sex can be had for pleasure, not just love. Mr. H puts Fanny up in a new apartment and begins paying her with jewels, clothes, and art. After seven months, Fanny discovers that Mr. H has been having sex with her maid, so she resolves to seduce Will, Mr. H's 19-year-old servant. Will has an extremely large penis: \"not the plaything of a boy, nor the weapon of a man, but a Maypole, of so enormous a standard, that, had proportions been observed, it must have belonged to a young giant...In short, it stood an object of terror and delight\". A month later, Mr. H catches Fanny having sex with Will, and stops supporting her.\nFanny is taken in by Mrs. Cole, the mistress of one of Mr. H's friends, who also happens to run a brothel in the Covent Garden neighborhood of London. Fanny meets three other prostitutes, who are also living in the house:\n\nEmily, a blonde girl in her early 20s who ran away at the age of 14 from her country home to London. She met a 15-year-old boy who, being sexually experienced, engaged in sexual intercourse with virgin Emily. Although the two lived together a short time, Emily became a street prostitute for several years before being taken in by Mrs. Cole.\nHarriet, a brunette and an orphan raised by her aunt, had her first sexual experience with the son of Lord N., a nobleman whose estate adjoined her relative's.\nLouisa, the bastard daughter of a cabinetmaker and a maid who entered puberty at a very young age and began engaging in extensive masturbation. While visiting her mother in London, Louisa began masturbating in her mother's bedroom. The landlady's 19-year-old son caught her and made love to the 13-year-old girl. Louisa spent the next few years having sex with as many men as she could and turned to prostitution as a means of satisfying her lust.\n\nA short time later, Fanny participates in an orgy with the three girls and four rich noblemen. Fanny and her young nobleman begin a relationship, but it ends after a few months because the young man moves to Ireland. Mrs. Cole next introduces Fanny to Mr. Norbert, an impotent alcoholic and drug addict who engages in rape fantasies with prostitutes. Unhappy with Mr. Norbert's impotence, Fanny engages in anonymous sex with a sailor in the Royal Navy. However, Mr. Norbert soon dies. Mrs. Cole then introduces Fanny to Mr. Barville, a rich, young masochist who requires whipping to enjoy sex. After a short affair, Fanny begins a sexual relationship with an elderly customer who becomes sexually aroused by caressing her hair and biting the fingertips off her gloves. After this ends, Fanny enters a period of celibacy.\nEmily and Louisa go to a drag ball, where Emily meets a bisexual young man who believes Emily is a male. When he finds out that she is actually a female, he has sex with Emily in his carriage. Fanny is confused by her first encounter with male homosexuality. Shortly after this incident, Fanny takes a ride in the country and ends up paying for a room at a public tavern after her carriage breaks down. She spies on two young men engaging in anal sex in the next room. Startled, she falls off a stool and knocks herself unconscious. Although the two men have left, she still rouses the villagers to try to hunt the two men down and punish them.\nSome weeks later, Fanny watches as Louisa seduces the teenage son of a local woman. Fanny believes that the boy's erect penis is even larger than Will's. The boy, clearly a virgin, engages in somewhat violent, brutal sex several times with Louisa. Louisa leaves Mrs. Cole's brothel a short time later after falling in love with another young man. Emily and Fanny are then invited by two gentleman to a country estate. They swim in a stream, and the two men have sex with the girls for several hours. Emily's parents soon find their daughter, and (unaware of her career as a prostitute) ask her to come home again. She accepts.\nMrs. Cole retires, and Fanny starts living off her savings. One day she encounters a man of 60 who looks 45 due to his lifestyle: \"He was, as I afterwards learn'd in the course of the intimacy which this little accident gave birth to, an old bachelor, turn'd of sixty, but of a fresh vigorous complexion, insomuch that he scarce marked five and forty, having never rack'd his constitution by permitting his desires to overtax his ability.\" The man falls in love with Fanny but treats her like his daughter. He dies and leaves his small fortune to her. Now 18 years old, Fanny uses her new wealth to try to locate Charles. She learns that he disappeared two and a half years ago after reaching the South Seas. Several months later, a despondent Fanny takes a trip to see Mrs. Cole (who had retired to Liverpool), but a storm forces her to stop at an inn along the way, where she runs into Charles: He had come back to England but was shipwrecked on the Irish coast. Fanny and Charles get a room together and make love several times. Fanny tells Charles everything about her life of vice, but he forgives her and asks Fanny to marry him, which she does.\n\n", "full_text": "MEMOIRS OF FANNY HILL\n\nBy John Cleland\n\n_A new and genuine edition from the original text (London, 1749)._\n\nPARIS - ISIDORE LISEUX\n\nOf this Edition, privately printed, there are 350 numbered copies, of\nwhich this is number 111.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER THE FIRST\n\nI sit down to give you an undeniable proof of my considering your\ndesires as indispensable orders. Ungracious then as the task may be, I\nshall recall to view those scandalous stages of my life, out of which I\nemerged, at length, to the enjoyment of every blessing in the power of\nlove, health and fortune to bestow; whilst yet in the flower of youth,\nand not too late to employ the leisure afforded me by great ease and\naffluence, to cultivate an understanding, naturally not a despicable\none, and which had, even amidst the whirl of loose pleasures I had been\ntossed in, exerted more observation on the characters and manners of\nthe world than what is common to those of my unhappy profession, who,\nlooking on all though or reflection as their capital enemy, keep it at\nas great a distance as they can, or destroy it without mercy.\n\nHating, as I mortally do, all long unnecessary prefaces, I shall give\nyou good quarter in this, and use no farther apology, than to prepare\nyou for seeing the loose part of my life, written with the same liberty\nthat I led it.\n\nTruth! stark, naked truth, is the word; and I will not so much as\ntake the pains to bestow the strip of a gauze wrapper on it, but paint\nsituations such as they actually rose to me in nature, careless of\nviolating those laws of decency that were never made for such unreserved\nintimacies as ours; and you have too much sense, too much knowledge of\nthe originals, to sniff prudishly and out of character at the pictures\nof them. The greatest men, those of the first and most leading taste,\nwill not scruple adorning their private closets with nudities, though,\nin compliance with vulgar prejudices, they may not think them decent\ndecorations of the staircase, or salon.\n\nThis, and enough, premised, I go souse into my personal history.\nMy maiden name was Frances Hill. I was born at a small village near\nLiverpool, in Lancashire, of parents extremely poor, and, I piously\nbelieve, extremely honest.\n\nMy father, who had received a maim on his limbs, that disabled him\nfrom following the more laborious branches of country drudgery, got,\nby making nets, a scanty subsistence, which was not much enlarged by my\nmother's keeping a little day-school for the girls in her neighborhood.\nThey had had several children; but none lived to any age except myself,\nwho had received from nature a constitution perfectly healthy.\n\nMy education, till past fourteen, was no better than very vulgar:\nreading, or rather spelling, an illegible scrawl, and a little ordinary\nplain work, composed the whole system of it; and then all my foundation\nin virtue was no other than a total ignorance of vice, and the shy\ntimidity general to our sex, in the tender age of life, when objects\nalarm or frighten more by their novelty than anything else. But then,\nthis is a fear too often cured at the expense of innocence, when Miss,\nby degrees, begins no longer to look on a man as a creature of prey that\nwill eat her.\n\nMy poor mother had divided her time so entirely between her scholars\nand her little domestic cares, that she had spared very little to my\ninstruction, having, from her own innocence from all ill, no hint or\nthought of guarding me against any.\n\nI was now entering on my fifteenth year, when the worst of ills befell\nme in the loss of my fond, tender parents, who were both carried off by\nthe small-pox, within a few days of each other; my father dying first,\nand thereby by hastening the death of my mother: so that I was now left\nan unhappy friendless orphan (for my father's coming to settle there,\nwas accidental, he being originally a Kentisrman). That cruel distemper\nwhich had proved so fatal to them, had indeed seized me, but with such\nmild and favourable symptoms, that I was presently out of danger, and\nwhat then I did not know the value of, was entirely unmarked I skip over\nhere an account of the natural grief and affliction which I felt on\nthis melancholy occasion. A little time, and the giddiness of that age,\ndissipated too soon my reflections on that irreparable loss; but nothing\ncontributed more to reconcile me to it, than the notions that were\nimmediately put into my head, of going to London, and looking out for\na service, in which I was promised all assistance and advice from one\nEsther Davis, a young woman that had beer down to see her friends, and\nwho, after the stay of a few days, was returned to her place.\n\nAs I had now nobody left alive in the village, who had concerned enough\nabout what should become of me, to start any objections to this scheme,\nand the woman who took care of me after my parents' death, rather\nencouraged me to pursue it, I soon came to a resolution of making this\nlaunch into the wide world, by repairing to London, in order to seek my\nfortune, a phrase which, by the bye, has ruined more adventurers of both\nsexes, from the country, than ever it made or advanced.\n\nNor did Esther Davis a little comfort and inspirit me to venture with\nher, by piquing my childish curiosity with the fine sights that were to\nbe seen in London: the Tombs, the Lions, the King, the Royal Family,\nthe fine Plays and Operas, and, in short, all the diversions which fell\nwithin her sphere of life to come at; the detail of all which perfectly\nturned the little head of me.\n\nNor can I remember, without laughing, the innocent admiration, not\nwithout a spice of envy, with which we poor girls, whose church-going\nclothes did not rise above dowlas shifts and stuff gowns, beplaced with\nsilver: all which we imagined grew in London, and entered for a great\ndeal into my determination of trying to come in for my share of them.\n\nThe idea however of having the company of a towns-woman with her, was\nthe trivial, and all the motives that engaged Esther to take charge of\nme during my journey to town, where she told me, after the manner and\nstyle, \"as how several maids out of the country had made themselves and\nall their kind for ever: that by preserving their virtue, some had\ntaken so with their masters, that they had married them, and kept them\ncoaches, and lived vastly grand and happy; and some, may-hap, came to be\nDuchesses; luck was all, and why not I, as well as another?\"; with other\nalmanacs to this purpose, which set me a tip-toe to begin this promising\njourney, and to leave a place which, though my native one, contained no\nrelations that I had reason to regret, and was grown insupportable to\nme, from the change of the tenderest usage into a cold air of charity,\nwith which I was entertained, even at the only friend's house that I had\nthe least expectation of care and protection from. She was, however, so\njust to me, as to manage the turning into money the little matters that\nremained to me after the debts and burial charges were allowed for, and,\nat my departure, put my whole fortune into my hands; which consisted\nof a very slender wardrobe, packed up in a very portable box, and eight\nguineas, with seventeen shillings in silver, stowed in a spring-pouch,\nwhich was a greater treasure than I ever had seen together, and which I\ncould not conceive there was a possibility of running out; and indeed, I\nwas so entirely taken up with the joy of seeing myself mistress of such\nan immence sum, that I gave very little attention to a world of good\nadvice which was given me with it.\n\nPlaces, then, being taken for Esther and me in the Chester waggon, I\npass over a very immaterial scene of leave-taking, at which I droped\na few tears betwixt grief and joy; and, for the same reasons of\ninsignificance, skip over all that happened to me on the road, such as\nthe waggoner's looking liquorish on me, the schemes laid for me by some\nof the passengers, which were defeated by the valiance of my guardian\nEsther; who, to do her justice, took a motherly care of me, at the\nsame time that she taxed me for the protection by making me bear all\ntravelling charges, which I defrayed with the unmost cheerfulness, and\nthought myself much obliged to her into the bargain.\n\nShe took indeed great care that we were not overrated, or imposed on, as\nwell as of managing as frugally as possible; expensiveness was not her\nvice.\n\nIt was pretty late in a summer evening when we reached the town, in our\nslow conveyance, though drawn by six at length. As we passed through\nthe greatest streets that led to our inn, the noise, of the coaches, the\nhurry, the crowds of foot passengers, in short, the new scenery of the\nshops and houses, at once pleased and amazed me.\n\nBut guess at my mortification and surprise when we came to the inn, and\nour things were landed and delivered to us, when my fellow traveller and\nprotectress, Esther Davis, who had used me with the utmost tenderness\nduring the journey, and prepared me by no preceedings signs for the\nstunning blow I was to receive, when I say, my only dependence and\nfriend, in this strange place, all of a sudden assumed a strange and\ncool air towards me, as if she dreaded my becoming a burden to her.\n\nInstead, then, of proffering me the continuance of her assistance and\ngood offices, which I relied upon, and never more wanted, she thought\nherself, it seems, abundantly acquitted of her engagements to me, by\nhaving brought me safe to my journey's end, and seeing nothing in her\nprocedure towards me but what natural and in order, began to embrace me\nby the way of taking leave, whilst I was so confounded, so struck,\nthat I had not spirit or sense enough so much as to mention my hopes\nor expectations from her experience, and knowledge of the place she had\nbrought me to.\n\nWhilst I stood thus stupid and mute, which she doubtless attributed to\nnothing more than a concern at parting, this idea procured me perhaps a\nslight alleviation of it, in the following harangue: \"That now we were\ngot safe to London, and that she was obliged to go to her place, she\nadvised me by all means to get into one as soon as possible; that I need\nnot fear getting one; there were more places than parish-churches; that\nshe advised me to go to an intelligence office; that if she heard of\nany thing stirring, she would find me out and let me know; that in the\nmeantime, I should take a private lodging, and acquaint her where to\nsend to me; that she wished me good luck, and hoped I should always\nhave the grace to keep myself honest, and not bringing a disgrace on\nmy parentage.\" With this; she took her leave of me, and left me, as it\nwere, on my own hands, full as lightly as I had been put into hers.\n\nLeft thus alone, absolutely destitute and friendless I began then to\nfeel most bitterly the severity of this separation, the scene of which\nhad passed in a little room in the inn; and no sooner was her back\nturned, but the affliction I felt at my helpless strange circumstances,\nburst out into a flood of tears, which infinitely relieved the oppression\nof my heart; though I still remained stupified, and most perfectly\nperplexed how to dispose of myself.\n\nOne of the waiters coming in, added yet more to my uncertainty, by\nasking me, in a short way, if I called for anything? to which I replied\ninnocently: \"No.\" But I wished him to tell me where I might get a\nlodging for that night. He said he would go and speak to his mistress,\nwho accordingly came, and told me drily, without entering in the least\ninto the distress she saw me in, that I might have a bed for a shilling,\nand that, as she supposed I had some friends in town (there I fetched a\ndeep sigh in vain!), I might provide for myself in the morning.\n\nIt is incredible what trifling consolations the human mind will seize\nin its greatest afflictions. The assurance of nothing more than a bed to\nlie on that night, calmed my agonies; and being ashamed to acquaint\nthe mistress of the inn that I had no friends to apply to in town, I\nproposed to myself to proceed, the very next morning, to an intelligence\noffice, to which I was furnished with written directions on the back of\na ballad, Esther had given me. There I counted on getting information\nof any place that such a country girl as I might be fit for, and where\nI could get into any sort of being, before my little stock should be\nconsumed; and as to a character, Esther had often repeated to me, that I\nmight depend on her managing me one; nor, however affected I was at\nher leaving me thus, did I entirely cease to rely on her, as I began to\nthink, good-naturedly, that her procedure was all in course, and that is\nwas only my ignorance of life that had made me take it in the light I at\nfirst did.\n\nAccordingly, the next morning I dressed myself as clean and as neat as\nmy rustic wardrobe would permit me; and having left my box, with special\nrecommendation, with the landlady, I ventured out by myself, and without\nany more difficulty than can be supposed of a young country girl, barely\nfifteen, and to whom every sign or shop was a gazing trap, I got to the\nwished for intelligence office.\n\nIt was kept by an elderly woman, who sat at the receipt of custom, with\na book before her in great form and order, and several scrolls made out,\nof directions for places.\n\nI made up then to this important personage, without lifting up my eyes\nor observing any of the people round me, who were attending there on the\nsame errand as myself, and dropping her curtsies nine deep, just made a\nshift to stammer out my business to her.\n\nMadam heard me out, with all the gravity and brow of a petty minister\nof State, and seeing at one glance over my figure what I was, made me no\nanswer, but to ask me the preliminary shilling, on receipt of which she\ntold me places for women too slight built for hard work: but that she\nwould look over her book, and see what was to be done for me, desiring\nme to stay a little, till she had dispatched some other customers.\n\nOn this I drew back a little, most heartily mortified at a declaration\nwhich carried with it a killing uncertainly, that my circumstances could\nnot well endure.\n\nPresently, assuming more courage, and seeking some diversion from my\nuneasy thoughts, I ventured to lift up my head a little, and sent my\neyes on a course round the room, where they met full tilt with those\nof a lady (for such my extreme innocence pronounced her) sitting in a\ncorner of the room, dressed in a velvet mantle (in the midst of summer),\nwith her bonnet off; squat, fat, red-faced, and at least fifty.\n\nShe looked as if she would devour me with her eyes, staring at me from\nhead to foot, without the least regard to the confusion and blushes her\neyeing me so fixedly put me to, and which were to her, no doubt, the\nstrongest recommendation and marks of my being fit for her purpose.\nAfter a little time, in which my air, person and whole figure had\nundergone a strict examination, which I had, on my part, tried to render\nfavourable to me, by primming, drawing up my neck, and setting my best\nlooks, she advanced and spoke to me with the greatest demureness:\n\n\"Sweet-heart, do you want a place?\n\n\"Yes, and please you,\" (with a curtsey down to the ground).\n\nUpon this she acquainted me she was actually come to the office herself,\nto look out for a servant; that she believed I might do, with a little\nof her instruction; that she could take my very looks for a sufficient\ncharacter; that London was a very wicked, vile, place; that she hoped I\nwould be tractable, and keep out of bad company; in short, she said all\nto me that an old experienced practitioner in town could think of,\nand which was much more than was necessary to take in an artless\ninexperienced country maid, who was even afraid of becoming a wanderer\nabout the streets, and therefore gladly jumped at the first offer of a\nshelter, especially from so grave and matron-like a lady, for such\nmy flattering fancy assured me this new mistress of mine was, I being\nactually hired under the nose of the good woman that kept the office,\nwhose shrewed smiles and shrugs I could not help observing, and\ninnocently interpreted them as marks of being pleased at my getting\ninto place so soon: but, as I afterwards came to know, these Beldams\nunderstood one another very well, and this was a market where Mrs.\nBrown, my mistress, frequently attended, on the watch for any fresh\ngoods that might offer there, for the use of her customers, and her own\nprofit.\n\nMadam was, however, so well pleased with her bargain that fearing I\npresume, lest better advice or some accident might occasion my slipping\nthrough her fingers, she would officiously take me in a coach to my inn,\nwhere, calling herself for my box, it was, I being present, delivered\nwithout the least scruple or explanation as to where I was going.\n\nThis being over, she bid the coachman drive to a shop in St. Paul's\nChurchyard, where she bought a pair of gloves, which she gave me, and\nthence renewed her directions to the coachman to drive to her house in\n------ street, who accordingly landed us at the door, after I had been\ncheered up and entertained by the way with the most plausible flams,\nwithout one syllable from which I could conclude anything but that I was,\nby the greatest luck, fallen into the hands of kindest mistress, not to\nsay friend, that the vast world could afford; and accordingly I entered\nher doors with most complete confidence and exultation, promising,\nmyself that, as soon as I could be a little settled, I would acquaint\nEsther Davis with my rare good fortune.\n\nYou may be sure the good opinion of my place was not lessened by the\nappearance of a very handsome back parlor, into which I was led and\nwhich seemed to me magnificently furnished, who had never seen better\nrooms than the ordinary ones in inns upon the road. There were two gilt\npier-glasses, and a buffet, on which a few pieces of plate, set out to\nthe most shew, dazzled, and altogether persuaded me that I must be got\ninto a very reputable family.\n\nHere my mistress first began her part, with telling me that I must have\ngood spirits, and learn to be free with her; that she had not taken me\nto be a common servant, to do domestic drudgery, but to be a kind of\ncompanion to her; and that if I would be a good girl, she would do\nmore than twenty mothers for me; to all which I answered only by the\nprofoundest and the awkwardest curtsies, and a few monosyllables, such\nas \"'yes! no! to be sure!\"\n\nPresently my mistress touched the bell, and in came a strapping\nmaid-servant, who had let us in. \"Here, Martha,\" said Mrs. Brown, \"I\nhave just hired this young woman to look after my linen; so step up and\nshow her her chamber; and I charge you to use her with as much respect\nas you would myself, for I have taken a prodigious liking to her, and I\ndo not know what I shall do for her.\"\n\nMartha, who was an arch-jade, and, being used to this decoy, had her\ncue perfect, made me a kind of half curtsy, and asked me to walk up\nwith her; and accordingly showed me a neat room, two pair of stairs\nbackwards, in which there was a handsome bed, where Martha told me I was\nto lie with a young gentlewoman, a cousin of my mistress, who she was\nsure would be vastly good to me. Then she ran out into such affected\nencomiums on her good mistress! her sweet mistress! and how happy I\nwas to light upon her! and that I could not have bespoke a better; with\nother the like gross stuff, such as would itself have started suspicions\nin any but such an unpractised simpleton, who was perfectly new to\nlife, and who took every word she said in the very sense she laid out\nfor me to take it; but she readily saw what a penetration she had to\ndeal with, and measured me very rightly in her manner of whistling to\nme, so as to make me pleased with my cage, and blind to the wires.\n\nIn the midst of these false explanations of the nature of my future\nservice, we were rung for down again, and I was reintroduced into the\nsame parlour, where there was a table laid with three covers; and my\nmistress had now got with her one of her favourite girls, a notable\nmanager of her house, and whose business it was to prepare and\nbreak such young fillies as I was to the mounting block; and she was\naccordingly, in that view, alloted me for a bed-fellow, and, to give her\nthe more authority, she had the title of cousin conferred on her by the\nvenerable president of this college.\n\nHere I underwent a second survey, which ended in the full approbation\nof Mrs. Phoebe Ayres, the name of my tutoress elect, to whose care and\ninstruction I was affectionately recommended.\n\nDinner was now set on table, and in pursuance of treating me as\na companion, Mrs. Brown, with a tone to cut off all dispute, soon\nover-ruled my most humble and most confused protestations against\nsitting down with her Ladyship, which my very short breeding just\nsuggested to me could not be right, or in the order of things.\n\nAt table, the conversation was chiefly kept up by the two madams and\ncarried on in double meaning expressions, interrupted every now and then\nby kind assurances to me, all tending to confirm and fix my satisfaction\nwith my present condition: augment it they could not, so very a novice\nwas I then.\n\nIt was here agreed that I should keep myself up and out of sight for a\nfew days, till such clothes could be procured for me as were fit for\nthe character I was to appear in, of my mistress's companion, observing\nwithal, that on the first impressions of my figure much might depend;\nand, as they rightly judged, the prospect of exchanging my country\nclothes for London finery, made the clause of confinement digest\nperfectly well with me. But the truth was, Mrs. Brown did not care that\nI should be seen or talked to by any, either of her customers, or her\nDoes (as they called the girls provided for them), till she secured a\ngood market for my maidenhead, which I had at least all the appearances\nof having brought into her Ladyship's service.\n\nTo slip over minutes of no importance to the main of my story, I pass\nthe interval to bed time, in which I was more and more pleased with the\nviews that opened to me, of an easy service under these good people; and\nafter supper being shewed up to bed, Miss Phoebe, who observed a kind\nof reluctance in me to strip and go to bed, in my shift, before her, now\nthe maid was withdrawn, came up to me, and beginning with unpinning\nmy handkerchief and gown, soon encouraged me to go on with undressing\nmyself; and, blushing at now seeing myself naked to my shift, I hurried\nto get under the bed-clothes out of sight.\n\nPhoebe laughed and was not long before she placed herself by my side.\nShe was about five and twenty, by her most suspicious account, in which,\naccording to all appearances, she must have sunk at least ten good\nyears; allowance, too, being made for the havoc which a long course of\nhackneyship and hot waters must have made of her constitution, and which\nhad already brought on, upon the spur, that stale stage in which those\nof her profession are reduced to think of showing company, instead of\nseeing it.\n\nNo sooner then was this precious substitute of my mistress laid down,\nbut she, who was never out of her way when any occasion of lewdness\npresented itself, turned to me, embraced and kissed me with great\neagerness. This was new, this was odd; but imputing it to nothing but\npure kindness, which, for ought I knew, it might be the London way to\nexpress in that manner, I was determined not to be behind-hand with her,\nand returned her the kiss and embrace, with all the fervour that perfect\ninnocence knew.\n\nEncouraged by this, her hands became extremely free, and wandered over\nmy whole body, with touches, squeezes, pressures, that rather warmed and\nsurprised me with their novelty, than they either shocked or alarmed me.\n\nThe flattering praises she intermingled with these invasions,\ncontributed also not a little to bribe my passiveness; and, knowing no\nill, I feared none, especially from one who had prevented all doubts\nof her womanhood, by conducting my hands to a pair of breasts that hung\nloosely down, in a size and volume that full sufficiently distinguished\nher sex, to me at least, who had never made any other comparison.\n\nI lay then all tame and passive as she could wish, whilst her freedom\nraised no other emotion but those of a strange, and, till then, unfelt\npleasure. Every part of me was open and exposed to the licentious\ncourses of her hands, which, like a lambent fire, ran over my whole\nbody, and thawed all coldness as they went.\n\nMy breasts, if it is not too bold a figure to call so two hard, firm,\nrising hillocks, that just began to shew themselves, or signify anything\nto the touch, employed and amused her hands awhile, till, slipping down\nlower, over a smooth track, she could just feel the soft silky down that\nhad but a few months before put forth and garnished the mount-pleasant\nof those parts, and promised to spread a grateful shelter over the sweet\nseat of the most exquisite sensation, and which had been, till that\ninstant, the seat of the most insensible innocence. Her fingers played\nand strove to twine in the young tendrils of that moss, which nature has\ncontrived at once for use and ornament.\n\nBut, not contented with these outer posts, she now attempts the main\nspot, and began to twitch, to insinuate, and at length to force an\nintroduction of a finger into the quick itself, in such a manner, that\nhad she not proceeded by insensible gradations that inflamed me beyond\nthe power of modesty to oppose its resistance to their progress, I\nshould have jumped out of bed and cried for help against such strange\nassaults.\n\nInstead of which, her lascivious touches had lighted up a new fire that\nwantoned through all my veins, but fixed with violence in that center\nappointed them by nature, where the first strange hands were now busied\nin feeling, squeezing, compressing the lips, then opening them again,\nwith a finger between, till an \"Oh!\" expressed her hurting me, where the\nnarrowness of the unbroken passage refused it entrance to any depth.\n\nIn the meantime, the extension of my limbs, languid stretching, sighs,\nshort heavings, all conspired to as-ure that experienced wanton that I\nwas more pleased than offended at her proceedings, which she seasoned\nwith repeated kisses and exclamations, such as \"Oh! what a charming\ncreature thou art! What a happy man will he be that first makes a woman\nof you! Oh! that I were a man for your sake!\" with the like broken\nexpressions, interrupted by kisses as fierce and salacious as ever I\nreceived from the other sex.\n\nFor my part, I was transported, confused, and out of myself; feelings so\nnew were too much for me. My heated and alarmed senses were in a tumult\nthat robbed me of all liberty of thought; tears of pleasure gushed from\nmy eyes, and somewhat assuaged the fire that raged all over me.\n\nPhoebe, herself, the hackneyed, thorough-bred Phoebe, to whom all modes\nand devices of pleasure were known and familiar, found, it seems,\nin this exercise her those arbitrary tastes, for which there is no\naccounting. Not that she hated men, or did not even prefer them to her\nown sex; but when she met with such occasions as this was, a satiety\nof enjoyments in the common road, perhaps, too a great secret bias,\ninclined her to make the most of pleasure, wherever she could find it,\nwithout distinction of sexes. In this view, now well assured that she\nhad, by her touches, sufficiently inflamed me for her purpose, she\nrolled down the bed clothes gently, and I saw myself stretched naked,\nmy shift being turned up to my neck, whilst I had no power or sense to\noppose it. Even my growing blushes expressed more desire than modesty,\nwhilst the candle, left (to be sure not undesignedly) burning, threw a\nfull light on my whole body.\n\n\"No!\" says Phoebe, \"you must not, my sweet girl, think to hide all these\ntreasures from me. My sight must be feasted as my touch. I must devour\nwith my eyes this springing bosom. Suffer me to kiss it. I have not seen\nit enough. Let me kiss it once more. What firm, smooth, white flesh is\nhere! How delicately shaped! Then this delicious down! Oh! let me view\nthe small, dear, tender cleft! This is too much, I cannot bear it! I\nmust! I must!\" Here she took my hand, and in a transport carried it\nwhere you will easily guess. But what a difference in the state of the\nsame thing! A spreading thicket of bushy curls marked the full grown,\ncomplete woman. Then the cavity to which she guided my hand easily\nreceived it; and as soon as she felt it within her, she moved herself to\nand fro, with so rapid a friction, that I presently withdrew it, wet\nand clammy, when instantly Phoebe grew more composed, after two or\nthree sighs, and heart-fetched Oh's! and giving me a kiss that seemed to\nexhale her soul through her lips, she replaced the bed-clothes over us.\nWhat pleasure she had found I will not say; but this I know, that the\nfirst sparks of kindling nature, the first ideas of pollution, were\ncaught by me that night; and that the acquaintance and communication\nwith the bad of our sex, is often as fatal to innocence as all the\nseductions of the other. But to go on. When Phoebe was restored to that\ncalm, which I was far from the enjoyment of myself, she artfully sounded\nme on all the points necessary to govern the designs of my virtuous\nmistress on me, and by my answers, drawn from pure undissembled nature,\nshe had no reason but to promise herself all imaginable success, so far\nas it depended on my ignorance, easiness and warmth of constitution.\n\nAfter a sufficient length of dialogue, my bedfellow left me to my rest,\nand I fell asleep, through pure weariness, from the violent emotions\nI had been led into, when nature which had been too warmly stirred and\nfermented to subside without allaying by some means or other relieved\nme by one of those luscious dreams, the transports of which are scarce\ninferior to those of waking real action.\n\nIn the morning I awoke about ten, perfectly gay and refreshed. Phoebe\nwas up before me, and asked me in the kindest manner how I did, how I\nhad rested, and if I was ready for breakfast? carefully, at the same\ntime, avoiding to increase the confusion she saw I was in, at looking\nher in the face, by any hint of the night's bed scene. I told her if she\npleased I would get up, and begin any work she would be pleased to set\nme about. She smiled; presently the maid brought in the tea equipage,\nand I just huddled my clothes on, when in waddled my mistress. I\nexpected no less than to be told of, if not chid for, my late rising,\nwhen I was most agreeably disappointed by her compliments on my pure\nand fresh looks. I was \"a bud of beauty\" (this was her style), \"and how\nvastly all the fine men would admire me!\" to all which my answers did\nnot, I can assure you, wrong my breeding; they were as simple and silly\nas they could wish, and, no doubt, flattered them infinitely more than\nhad they proved me enlightened by education and a knowledge of the\nworld.\n\nWe breakfasted, and the tea things were scarce removed, when in were\nbrought two bundles of linen and wearing apparel: in short, all the\nnecessaries for rigging me out, as they termed it, completely.\n\nImagine to yourself, Madam, how my little coquet heart fluttered with\njoy at the sight of a white lutestring, flowered with silver, scoured\nindeed, but passed on me for spick and span new, a Brussels lace cap,\nbraited shoes, and the rest in proportion, all second-hand finery, and\nprocured instantly for the occasion, by the diligence and industry of\nthe good Mrs. Brown, who had already a chapman for me in the house,\nbefore whom my charms were to pass in review; for he had not only,\nin course, insisted on a previous sight of the premises, but also\non immediate surrendering to him, in case of his agreeing for me;\nconcluding very wisely, that such a place as I was in, was of the\nhottest to trust the keeping of such a perishable commodity in, as a\nmaidenhead.\n\nThe care of dressing and tricking me out for the market, was then left\nto Phoebe, who acquitted herself, if not well, at least perfectly to the\nsatisfaction of everything but my impatience of seeing myself dressed.\nWhen it was over, and I viewed myself in the glass, I was no doubt, too\nnatural, too artless, to hide my childish joy at the change: a change,\nin the real truth, for much the worse, since I must have much better\nbecome the neat easy simplicity of my rustic dress than the awkward,\nuntoward, tawdry finery that I could not conceal my strangeness to.\n\nPhoebe's compliments, however, in which her own share in dressing me was\nnot forgot, did not a little confirm me in the first notions I had ever\nentertained concerning my person; which, be it said without vanity, was\nthen tolerable to justify a taste for me, and of which it may not be out\nof place here to sketch you an unflattered picture.\n\nI was tall, yet not too tall for my age, which, as I before remarked,\nwas barely turned of fifteen; my shape perfectly straight, thin waisted,\nand light and free without owing anything to stays; my hair was a glossy\nauburn, and as soft as silk, flowing down my neck in natural curls, and\ndid not a little to set off the whiteness of a smooth skin; my face was\nrather too ruddy, though its features were delicate, and the shape was a\nroundish oval, except where a pit on my chin had far from a disagreeable\neffect; my eyes were as black as can be imagined, and rather languishing\nthan sparkling, except on certain occasions, when I have been told they\nstruck fire fast enough; my teeth, which I ever carefully preserved,\nwere small, even and white; my bosom was finely raised, and one might\nthen discern rather the promise than the actual growth of the round,\nfirm breast, that in a little time made that promise good. In short, all\nthe points of beauty that are most universally in request, I had, or at\nleast my vanity forbid me to appeal from the decision of our sovereign\njudges the men, who all, that I ever knew at last, gave it thus highly\nin my favour; and I met with, even in my own sex, some that were\nabove denying me that justice, whilst others praised me yet more\nunsuspectedly, by endeavouring to detract from me, in points of person\nand figure that I obviously excelled in. This is, I own, too strong\nof self praise; but I should be ungrateful to nature, and to a form to\nwhich I owe such singular blessings of pleasure and fortune, were I\nto suppress, through an affectation of modesty, the mention of such\nvaluable gifts.\n\nWell then, dressed I was, and little did it then enter into my head\nthat all this gay attire was no more than decking the victim out for\nsacrifice, whilst I innocently attributed all to mere friendship and\nkindness in the sweet good Mrs. Brown; who, I was forgetting to mention,\nhad, under pretence of keeping my money safe, got from me, without the\nleast hesitation, the driblet (so I now call it) which remained to me\nafter the expenses of my journey.\n\nAfter some little time most agreebly spent before the glass, in scarce\nself-admiration, since my new dress had by much the greatest share in\nit, I was sent for down to the parlour, where the old lady saluted me,\nand wished me joy of my new clothes, which she was not ashamed to say,\nfitted me as if I had worn nothing but the finest all my life-time; but\nwhat was it she could not see me silly enough to swallow? At the same\ntime, she presented me to another cousin of her own creation, an elderly\ngentleman, who got up, at my entry into the room, and on my dropping a\ncurtsy to him, saluted me, and seemed a little affronted that I had\nonly presented my cheek to him: a mistake, which, if one, he immediately\ncorrected, by gluing his lips to mine, with an ardour which his figure\nhad not at all disposed me to thank him for: his figure, I say, than\nwhich nothing could be more shocking or detestable: for ugly and\ndisagreeable were terms too gentle to convey a just idea of it.\n\nImagine to yourself, a man rather past threescore, short and ill-made,\nwith a yellow cadaverous hue, great goggle eyes, that stared as if he\nwas strangled; an out-mouth from two more properly tusks than teeth,\nlivid lips, and breath like a Jake's: then he had a peculiar ghastliness\nin his grin, that made him perfectly frightful, if not dangerous to\nwomen with child; yet, made as he was thus in mock of man, he was\nso blind to his own staring deformities, as to think himself born to\nplease, and that no woman could see him with impunity: in consequence\nof which idea, he had lavished great sums on such wretches as could gain\nupon themselves to pretend love to his person, whilst to those who had\nnot art or patience to dissemble the horror it inspired, he behaved even\nbrutally. Impotence, more than necessity, made him seek in variety, the\nprovocative that was wanting to raise him to the pitch of enjoyment,\nwhich he too often saw himself baulked of, by the failure of his powers:\nand this always threw him into a fit of rage, which he wreaked, as far\nas he durst, on the innocent objects of his fit of momentary desire.\n\nThis then was the master to which my conscientious benefactress, who had\nlong been his purveyor in this way, had doomed me, and sent for me down\npurposely for his examination. Accordingly she made me stand up before\nhim, turned me round, unpinned my handkerchief, remarked to him the rise\nand fall, the turn and whiteness of a bosom just beginning to fill; then\nmade me walk, and took even a handle from the rusticity of my charms: in\nshort, she omitted no point of jockeyship; to which he only answered by\ngracious nods of approbation, whilst he looked goats and monkeys at\nme: for I sometimes stole a corner glance at him, and encountering his\nfiery, eager stare, looked another way from pure horror and affright,\nwhich he, characteristically, attributed to nothing more than maiden\nmodesty, or at least the affectation of it.\n\nHowever, I was soon dismissed, and reconducted to my room by Phoebe,\nwho stuck close to me, not leaving me alone, and at leisure to make such\nreflections as might naturally rise to any one, not an idiot, on such a\nscene as I had just gone through; but to my shame be it confessed, that\njust was my invincible stupidity, or rather portentous innocence, that\nI did not yet open my eyes to Mrs. Brown's designs, and saw nothing in\nthis titular cousin of hers but a shockingly hideous person, which did\nnot at all concern me, unless that my gratitude for my benefactress made\nme extend my respect to all her cousinhood.\n\nPhoebe, however, began to sift the state and pulses of my heart toward\nthis monster, asking me how I should approve of such a fine gentelman\nfor a husband. (Fine gentleman, I suppose she called him, from his being\ndaubed with lace.) I answered her very naturally, that I had no thoughts\nof a husband, but that if I was to choose one, it should be among my own\ndegree, sure! so much had my aversion to that wretch's hideous figure\nindisposed me to all \"fine gentlemen,\" and confounded my ideas, as if\nthose of that rank had been necessarily cast in the same mould that\nhe was. But Phoebe was not to be put off so, but went on with her\nendeavours to melt and soften me for the purposes of my reception into\nthat hospitable house: and whilst she talked of the sex in general, she\nhad no reason to despair of a compliance, which more than one reason\nshowed her would be easily enough obtained of me; but then she had too\nmuch experience not to discover that my particular fixed aversion to\nthat frightful cousin would be a block not so readily to be removed, as\nsuited the consummation of their bargain, and sale of me.\n\nMother Brown had in the meantime agreed the terms with this loquorice\nold goat, which I afterwards understood were to be fifty guineas\nperemptory, for the liberty of attempting me, and a hundred more at the\ncomplete gratification of his desires, in the triumph over my virginity:\nand as for me, I was to be left entirely at the discretion of his liking\nand generosity. This unrighteous contract being thus settled, he was so\neager to be put in possession, that he insisted on being introduced to\ndrink tea with me that afternoon, when we were to be left alone; nor\nwould he hearken to the procuress's remonstrances, that I was not\nsufficiently prepared, and ripened for such an attack; that I was too\ngreen and untamed, having been scarce twenty-four hours in the house:\nit is the character of lust to be impatient, and his vanity arming him\nagainst any supposition of other than the common resistance of a maid\non those occasions, made him reject all proposals of a delay, and my\ndreadful trial was thus fixed, unknown to me, for that very evening.\n\nAt dinner, Mrs. Brown and Phoebe did nothing but run riot in praise of\nthis wonderful cousin, and how happy that woman would be that he would\nfavour with his addresses; in short my two gossips exhausted all\ntheir rhetoric to persuade me to accept them: \"that the gentleman was\nviolently smitten with me at first sight; that he would make my fortune\nif I would be a good girl and not stand in my own light; that I should\ntrust his honour; that I should be made for ever, and have a chariot to\ngo abroad in,\" with all such stuff as was fit to turn the head of such\na silly ignorant girl as I then was: but luckily here my aversion had\ntaken already such deep root in me, my heart was so strongly defended\nfrom him by my senses, that wanting the art to mask my sentiments, I\ngave them no hopes of their employer succeeding, at least very easily,\nwith me. The glass too marched pretty quick, with a view, I suppose, to\nmake a friend of the warmth of my constitution, in the minutes of the\nimminent attack.\n\nThus they kept me pretty long at table, and about six in the evening,\nafter I had retired to my apartment, and the tea board was set, enters\nmy venerable mistress, followed close by that satyr, who came in\ngrinning in a way peculiar to him, and by his odious presence, confirmed\nme in all the sentiments of detestation which his first appearance had\ngiven birth to.\n\nHe sat down fronting me, and all tea time kept ogling me in a manner\nthat gave me the utmost pain and confusion, all the mark of which he\nstill explained to be my bashfulness, and not being used to see company.\n\nTea over, the commoding old lady pleady urgent business (which indeed\nwas true) to go out, and earnestly desired me to entertain her cousin\nkindly till she came back, both for my own sake and her; and then, with\na \"Pray, sir, be very good, be very tender to the sweet child,\" she went\nout of the room, leaving me staring, with my mouth open, and unprepared\nby the suddenness of her departure, to oppose it.\n\nWe were now alone; and on that idea a sudden fit of trembling seized\nme. I was so afraid, without a precise notion of why, and what I had\nto fear, that I sat on the settee, by the fire side, motionless and\npetrified, without life or spirit, not knowing how to look or how to\nstir.\n\nBut long I was not suffered to remain in this state of stupefaction: the\nmonster squatted down by me on the settee, and without farther ceremony\nor preamble, flings his arms about my neck, and drawing me pretty\nforcibly towards him, obliged me to receive, in spite of my struggles\nto disengage from him, his pestilential kisses, which quite overcame me.\nFinding me then next to senseless, and unresisting, he tears off my neck\nhandkerchief, and laid all open there, to his eyes and hands: still\nI endured all without flinching, till emboldened by my sufferance and\nsilence, for I had not the power to speak or cry out, he attempted to\nlay me down on the settee, and I felt his hand on the lower part of my\nnaked thighs, which were crossed, and which he endeavoured to unlock. Oh\nthen! I was roused out of my passive endurance, and springing from him\nwith an activity he was not prepared for, threw myself at his feet, and\nbegged him, in the most moving tone, not to be rude, and that he would\nnot hurt me. \"Hurt you, my dear?\" says the brute, \"I intend you no\nharm. Has not the old lady told you that I love you? that I shall do\nhandsomely by you?\"\n\n\"She has indeed, sir,\" said I, \"but I cannot love you, indeed I cannot!\npray let me alone! yes! I will love you dearly if you will let me alone\nand go away.\" But I was talking to the wind, for whether my tears,\nmy attitude, or the disorder of my dress proved fresh incentives, or\nwhether he was now under the dominion of desires he could not bridle,\nbut snorting and foaming with lust and rage, he renews his attack,\nseizes me, and again attempts to extend and fix me on the settee:\nin which he succeeded so far as to lay me along, and even to toss my\npetticoats over my head, and lay my thighs bare, which I obstinately\nkept close, nor could he, though he attempted with his knee to force\nthem open, effect it so as to stand fair for being master of the main\navenue; he was unbuttoned, both waistcoat and breeches, yet I only\nfelt the weight of his body upon me, whilst I lay struggling with\nindignation, and dying with terrors; but he stopped all of a sudden, and\ngot off, panting, blowing, cursing, and repeating \"old and ugly!\" for so\nI had very naturally called him in the heat of my defence.\n\nThe brute had, it seems, as I afterwards understood, brought on, by\nhis eagerness and struggle, the ultimate period of his hot fit of\nlust, which his power was too short-lived to carry him through the full\nexecution of; of which my thighs and linen received the effusion.\n\nWhen it was over he bid me, with a tone of displeasure, get up: \"that he\nwould not do me the honour to think of me any more; that the old b----h\nmight look out for another cully; that he would not be fooled so by\never a country mock modesty in England; that he supposed I had left my\nmaidenhead with some hobnail in the country, and was come to dispose of\nmy skim-milk in town\" with a volley of the like abuse; which I listened\nto with more pleasure than ever fond woman did to protestations of\nlove from her darling minion: for, incapable as I was of receiving any\naddition to my perfect hatred and aversion to him, I looked on this\nrailing, as my security against his renewing his most odious caress.\n\nYet, plain as Mrs. Brown's views were now come out, I had not the\nheart, or spirit to open my eyes to them: still I could not part with\nmy dependence on that beldam, so much did I think myself hers, soul and\nbody: or rather, I sought to deceive myself with the continuation of my\ngood opinion of her, and choose to wait the worst at her hands, sooner\nthan be turned out to starve in the streets, without a penny of money or\na friend to apply to these fears were my folly.\n\nWhile this confusion of ideas was passing in my head, and I sat\npensively by the fire, with my eyes brimming with tears, my neck still\nbare, and my cap fallen off in the struggle, so that my hair was in the\ndisorder you may guess, the villain's lust began, I suppose, to be again\nin flow, at the sight of all that bloom of youth which presented itself\nto his view, a bloom yet unenjoyed, and of course not yet indifferent to\nhim.\n\nAfter some pause, he asked me with a tone of voice mightily softer,\nwhether I would make it up with him before the old lady returned, and\nall should be well; he would restore me to his affections, at the\nsame time offering to kiss me and feel my breasts. But now my extreme\naversion, my fears, my indignation, all acting upon me, gave me a spirit\nnot natural to me, so that breaking loose from him, I ran to the bell\nand rang it, with such violence and effect as to bring up the maid to\nknow what was the matter, or whether the gentleman wanted anything; and\nbefore he could proceed to greater extremities, she bounced into the\nroom, and seeing me stretched on the floor, my hair all dishevelled, my\nnose gushing out blood, which did not a little tragedize the scene, and\nmy odious persecutor still intent of pushing his brutal point, unmoved\nby all my cries and distress, she was herself confounded and did not\nknow what to do.\n\nAs much, however, as Martha might be prepared and hardened to\ntransactions of this sort, all womanhood must have been out of her heart\ncould she have seen this unmoved. Besides that, on the face of things,\nshe imagined that matters had gone greater lengths than they really had,\nand that the courtesy of the house had been actually consummated on me,\nand flung: me into the condition I was in: in this notion she instantly\ntook my part, and advised the gentleman to go down and leave me to\nrecover myself, and \"that all would be soon over with me; that when\nMrs. Brown and Phoebe, who were gone out, were returned, they would take\norder for everything to his satisfaction; that nothing would be lost by\na little patience with the poor tender thing; that for her part she was\nfrightened; she could not tell what to say to such doings; but that she\nwould stay by me till my mistress came home.\" As the wench said all\nthis in a resolute tone, and the monster himself began to perceive that\nthings would not mend by his staying, he took his hat and went out of\nthe room murmuring and pitting his brows like an old ape, so that I was\ndelivered from the horrors of his detestable presence.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, Martha very tenderly offered me her assistance\nin anything, and would have got me some hartshorn drops and put me to\nbed; which last I, at first, positively refused, in the fear that the\nmonster might return and take me at that disadvantage. However, with\nmuch persuasion and assurances that I should not be molested that night\nshe prevailed on me to lie down; and indeed I was so weakened by my\nstruggles, so dejected by my fearful apprehension, so terror-struck,\nthat I had not power to sit up, or hardly to give answers to the\nquestions with which the curious Martha plied and perplexed me.\n\nSuch too, and so cruel was my fate, that I dreaded the sight of Mrs.\nBrown, as if I had been the criminal, and she the person injured; a\nmistake which you will not think so strange, on distinguishing that\nneither virtue nor principles had the least share in the defence I had\nmade, but only the particular aversion I had conceived against this\nfirst brutal and frightful invader of my tender innocence.\n\nI passed then the time till Mrs. Brown came home, under all the\nagitations of fear and despair that may easily be guessed.\n\nAbout eleven at night my two ladies came home, and having received\nrather a favourable account from Martha, who had run down to let them\nin, for Mr. Crofts (that was the name of my brute) was gone out of the\nhouse, after waiting till he had tired his patience for Mrs. Brown's\nreturn, they came thundering up stairs, and seeing me pale, my face\nbloody, and all the marks of the most thorough dejection, they employed\nthemselves more to comfort and re-inspirit me than in making me the\nreproaches I was weak enough to fear, I who had so many juster and\nstronger to retort upon them.\n\nMrs. Brown withdrawn, Phoebe came presently to bed to me, and what\nwith the answers she drew from me, what with her own method of palpably\nsatisfying herself, she soon discovered that I had been more frightened\nthan hurt; upon which I suppose, being herself seized with sleep, and\nreserving her lectures and instructions till the next morning, she left\nme, properly speaking, to my unrest; for, later tossing and turning\nthe greatest part of the night, and tormenting myself with the falsest\nnotions and apprehensions of things, I fell, through mere fatigue into\na kind of delirious doze, out of which I waked late in the morning, in\na violent fever: a circumstance which was extremely critical to reprieve\nme, at least for a time, from the attacks of a wretch, infinitely more\nterrible to me than death itself.\n\nThe interested care that was taken of me during my illness, in order to\nrestore me to a condition of making good the bawd's engagements, or of\nenduring further trials, had, however, such an effect on my grateful\ndisposition that I even thought myself obliged to my un-doers for their\nattention to promote my recovery; and, above all, for the keeping out\nof my sight of that brutal ravisher, the author of my disorder, on their\nfinding I was too strongly moved at the bare mention of his name.\n\nYouth is soon raised, and a few days were sufficient to conquer the fury\nof my fever: but, what contributed most to my perfect recovery and to my\nreconciliation with life, was the timely news that Mr. Crofts, who was a\nmerchant of considerable dealings, was arrested at the King's suit,\nfor nearly forty thousand pounds, on account of his driving a certain\ncontraband trade, and that his affairs were so desperate, that even were\nit in his inclination, it would not be in his power to renew his designs\nupon me: for he was instantly thrown into a prison, which it was not\nlikely he would get out of in haste.\n\nMrs. Brown, who had touched his fifty guineas, advanced to so little\npurpose, and lost all hopes of the remaining hundred, began to look upon\nmy treatment of him with a more favourable eye; and as they had observed\nmy temper to be perfectly tractable and conformable to their views, all\nthe girls that composed her flock were suffered to visit me, and had\ntheir cue to dispose me, by their conversation, to a perfect resignation\nof myself to Mrs. Brown's direction.\n\nAccordingly they were let in upon me, and all that frolic and\nthoughtless gaiety in which those giddy creatures consume either\nleisure, made me envy a condition of which I only saw the fair side;\ninsomuch, that the being one of them became even my ambition: a\ndisposition which they all carefully cultivated; and I wanted now\nnothing but to restore my health, that I might be able to undergo the\nceremony of the initiation.\n\nConversation, example, in short all, contributed, in that house, to\ncorrupt my native parity, which had taken no root in education; whilst\nnow the inflammable principal of pleasure, so easily fired at my age,\nmade strange work within me, and all the modesty I was brought up in the\nhabit, not the instruction of, began to melt away like dew before the\nsun's heat; not to mention that I made a vice of necessity, from the\nconstant fears I had of being turned out to starve.\n\nI was soon pretty well recovered, and at certain hours allowed to range\nall over the house, but cautiously kept from seeing any company till the\narrival of Lord B----, from Bath, to whom Mrs. Brown, in respect to his\nexperienced generosity on such occasions, proposed to offer the perusal\nof that trinket of mine, which bears so great an imaginary value; and\nhis lordship being expected in town in less than a fortnight, Mrs. Brown\njudged I would be entirely renewed in beauty and freshness by that time,\nand afforded her the chance of a better bargain than she had driven with\nMr. Crofts.\n\nIn the meantime, I was so thoroughly, as they call it, brought over, so\ntame to their whistle, that, had my cage door been set open, I had no\nidea that I ought to fly anywhere, sooner than stay where I was; nor had\nI the least sense of regretting my condition, but waited very quietly\nfor whatever Mrs. Brown should order concerning me; who on her side, by\nherself and her agents, took more than the necessary precautions to lull\nand lay asleep all just reflections on my destiny.\n\nPreachments of morality over the left shoulder; a life of joy painted in\nthe gayest colours; caresses, promises, indulgent treatment; nothing,\nin short, was wanting to domesticate me entirely and to prevent my going\nout anywhere to get better advice. Alas! I dreamed of no such thing.\n\nHitherto I had been indebted only to the girls of the house for the\ncorruption of my innocence: their luscious talk, in which modesty was\nfar from respected, their description of their engagements with men,\nhad given me a tolerable insight into the nature and mysteries of their\nprofession, at the same time that they highly provoked an itch of florid\nwarm-spirited blood through every vein: but above all, my bed fellow\nPhoebe, whose pupil I more immediately was, exerted her talents in\ngiving me the first tinctures of pleasure: whilst nature, now warmed\nand wantoned with discoveries so interesting, piqued a curiosity which\nPhoebe artfully whetted, and leading me from question to question of her\nown suggestion, explained to me all the mysteries of Venus. But I could\nnot long remain in such a house as that, without being an eye-witness of\nmore than I could conceive from her descriptions.\n\nOne day, about twelve at noon, being thoroughly recovered of my fever, I\nhappened to be in Mrs. Brown's dark closet, where I had not been half\nan hour, resting upon the maid's bed, before I heard a rustling in the\nbed-chamber, separated from the closet only by two sash doors, before\nthe glasses of which were drawn two yellow damask curtains, but not so\nclose as to exclude the full view of the room from any person in the\ncloset.\n\nI instantly crept softly and posted myself so, that seeing everything\nminutely, I could not myself be seen; and who should come in but the\nvenerable mother Abbess herself! handed in by a tall, brawny young\nHorse-grenadiers, moulded in the Hercules style: in fine, the choice of\nthe most experienced dame, in those affairs, in all London.\n\nOh! how still and hush did I keep at my stand, lest any noise should\nbaulk my curiosity, or bring Madam into the closet!\n\nBut I had not much reason to fear either, for she was entirely taken up\nwith her present great concern, that she had no sense of attention to\nspare to anything else.\n\nDroll was it to see that clumsy fat figure of her's flop down on the\nfoot of the bed, opposite to the closet door so that I had a full front\nview of all her charms.\n\nHer paramour sat down by her: he seemed to be a man of very few words,\nand a great stomach; for proceeding instantly to essentials, he gave her\nsome hearty smacks, and thrusting his hands into her breasts, disengaged\nthem from her stays, in scorn of whose confinement they broke loose, and\nsagged down, navel-low at least. A more enormous pair did my eyes\nnever behold, nor of a worse colour, flagging, soft, and most lovingly\ncontiguous: yet such as they were, this great beef-eater seemed to paw\nthem with a most unenviable lust, seeking in vain to confine or cover\none of them with a hand scarce less than a shoulder of mutton. After\ntoying with them thus some time, as if they had been worth it, he laid\nher down pretty briskly, and canting up her petticoats, made barely\na mask of them to her broad red face, that blushed with nothing but\nbrandy.\n\nAs he stood on one side, unbuttoning his waistcoat and breeches, her fat\nbrawny thighs hung down, and the whole greasy landscape lay fairly open\nto my view; a wide open mouthed gap, overshaded with a grizzly bush,\nseemed held out like a beggar's wallet for its provision.\n\nBut I soon had my eyes called off by a more striking object that\nentirely engrossed them.\n\nHer sturdy stallion had now unbuttoned, and produced naked, stiff and\nerect, that wonderful machine, which I had never seen before, and which,\nfor the interest my own seat of pleasure began to take furiously in it,\nI stared at with all the eyes I had: however, my senses were too much\nflurried, too much concentered in that now burning spot of mine,\nto observe anything more than in general the make and turn of that\ninstrument; from which the instinct of nature, yet more than all I had\nheard of it, now strongly informed me, I was to expect that supreme\npleasure which she had placed in the meeting of those parts so admirably\nfitted for each other.\n\nLong, however, the young spark did not remain before giving it two or\nthree shakes, by way of brandishing it, he threw himself upon her, and\nhis back being now towards me, I could only take his being ingulphed for\ngranted, by the directions he moved in, and the impossibility of missing\nso staring a mark; and now the bed shook, the curtains rattled so that\nI could scarce hear the sighs and murmurs, the heaves and pantings that\naccompanied the action, from the beginning to the end; the sound and\nsight of which thrilled to the very soul of me, and made every vein of\nmy body circulate liquid fires: the emotion grew so viol-lent that it\nalmost intercepted my respiration.\n\nPrepared then, and disposed as I was by the discourse of my companions,\nand Phoebe's minute detail of everything, no wonder that such a sight\ngave the last dying blow to my native innocence.\n\nWhilst they were in the heat of the action, guided by nature only, I\nstole my hand up my petticoats, and with fingers on fire, seized and yet\nmore inflamed that center of all my senses: my heart palpitated, as if\nit would force its way through my bosom: I breathed with pain; I twisted\nmy thighs, squeezed and compressed the lips of that virgin slit, and\nfollowing mechanically the example of Phoebe's manual operation on\nit, as far as I could find admission, brought on at last the critical\necstasy, the melting flow, into which nature, spent with excess of\npleasure, dissolves and dies away.\n\nAfter which, my senses recovered coolness enough to observe the rest of\nthe transaction between this happy pair.\n\nThe young fellow had just dismounted, when the old lady immediately\nsprung up, with all the vigour of youth, derived, no doubt, from her\nlate refreshment; and making him sit down, began in her turn to kiss\nhim, to pat and pinch his cheeks, and play with his hair: all which he\nreceived with an air of indifference and coolness that showed him to be\nmuch altered from what he was when he first went on to the breach.\n\nMy pious governess, however, not being above calling in auxiliaries,\nunlocks a little case of cordials that stood near the bed, and made him\npledge her in a very plentiful dram: after which, and a little amorous\nparley, Madam set herself down upon the same place, at the bed's foot;\nand the young fellow standing sidewise by her, she, with the greatest\neffrontery imaginable, unbuttons his breeches, and removing his shirt,\ndraws out his affair, so shrunk and diminished, that I could not but\nremember the difference, now crest-fallen, or just faintly lifting\nits head: but our experience matron very soon, by chaffing it with her\nhands, brought it to swell to that size and erection I had before seen\nit up to.\n\nI admired then, upon a fresh account, and with a nicer survey, the\ntexture of that capital part of man: the flaming red head as it stood\nuncapt, the whiteness of the shaft, and the shrub growth of curling hair\nthat embrowned the foots of it, the roundish bag that dangled down from\nit, all exacted my eager attention, and renewed my flame. But, as the\nmain affair was now at the point the industrious dame had laboured to\nbring it to, she was not in the humour to put off the payment of her\npains, but laying herself down, drew him gently upon her, and thus they\nfinished, in the same manner as before, the old last act.\n\nThis over, they both went out lovingly together, the old lady having\nfirst made him a present, as near as I could observe, of three or four\npieces; he being not only her particular favourite on account of his\nperformances, but a retainer to the house; from whose sight she had\ntaken great care hitherto to secret me, lest he might not have had\npatience to wait for my lord's arrival, but have insisted on being his\ntaster, which the old lady was under too much subjection to him to dare\ndispute with him; for every girl of the house fell to him in course,\nand the old lady only now and then got her turn, in consideration of the\nmaintenance he had, and which he could scarce be accused of not earning\nfrom her.\n\nAs soon as I heard them go down-stairs, I stole up softly to my own\nroom, out of which I had luckily not been missed; there I began to\nbreathe more free, and to give a loose to those warm emotions which the\nsight of such an encounter had raised in me, I laid me down on the bed,\nstretched myself out, joining and ardently wishing, and requiring any\nmeans to divert or allay the rekindled rage and tumult of my desires,\nwhich all pointed strongly to their pole: man. I felt about the bed as\nif I sought for something that I grasped in my waking dream, and not\nfinding it, could have cried for vexation; every part of me plowing with\nsimulated fires. At length, I resorted to the only present remedy, that\nof vain attempts at digitation, where the small-ness of the theatre did\nnot yet afford room enough for action, and where the pain my fingers\ngave me, in striving for admission, though they procured me a slight\nsatisfaction for the present, started an apprehension which I could not\nbe easy till I had communicated to Phoebe and received her explanations\nupon it.\n\nThe opportunity, however, did not offer till next morning, for Phoebe\ndid not come to bed till long after I was gone to sleep. As soon then as\nwe were both awake, it was but in course to bring our ly-a-bed chat to\nhand, on the subject of my uneasiness: to which a recital of the love\nscene I had thus, by chance, been spectatress of, served for a preface.\n\nPhoebe could not hear it to the end without more than one interruption\nby peals of laughter, and my ingenuous way of relating matters did not a\nlittle heighten the joke to her.\n\nBut, on her sounding me how the sight had affected me, without mincing\nor hiding the pleasurable emotions it had inspired me with, I told\nher at the same time that one remark had perplexed me, and that very\nconsiderably. \"Aye!\" says she, \"what was that?\" \"Why,\" replied I,\n\"having very curiously and attentively compared the size of that\nenormous machine, which did not appear, at least to my fearful\nimagination, less than my wrist, and at least three of my hand-fuls\nlong, to that of the tender small part of me which was framed to receive\nit, I could not conceive its being possible to afford it entrance\nwithout dying, perhaps in the greatest pain, since she well knew\nthat even a finger thrust in there hurt me beyond bearing. As to my\nmistress's and yours, I can very plainly distinguish the different\ndimensions of them from mine, palpable to the touch, and visible to\nthe eye; so that, in short, great as the promised pleasure may be, I am\nafraid of the pain of the experiment.\"\n\nPhoebe at this redoubled her laugh, and whilst I expected a very serious\nsolution of my doubts and apprehensions in this matter, only told me\nthat \"she never heard of a mortal wound being given in those parts, by\nthat terrible weapon, and that some she knew younger, and as delicately\nmade as myself, had outlived the operation; that she believed, at the\nworst, I should take a great deal of liking; that true it was, there was\na great diversity of sizes in those parts, owing to nature, child-bearing,\nfrequent over-stretching with unmerciful machines, but that at a certain\nage and habit of body, even the most experienced in those affairs could\nnot well distinguish between the maid and the woman, supposing too an\nabsence of all artifice, in their natural situation: but that since\nchance had thrown in my way one sight of that sort, she would procure me\nanother, that should feast my eyes more delicately, and go a great way\nin the cure of my fears from that imaginary disproportion\".\n\nOn this she asked me if I knew Polly Phillips? \"Undoubterly,\" says I,\n\"the fair girl which was so tender of me when I was sick, and has been,\nas you told me, but two months in the house.\" \"The same,\" says Phoebe.\n\"You must know then, she is kept by a young Genoes merchant, whom his\nuncle, who is immensely rich, and whose darling he is, on a pretex of\nsettling some accounts, but in reality to humour his inclinations for\ntravelling, and seeing the world. He met casually with this Polly once\nin company, and taking a likning to her, makes it worth her while to\nkeep entirely to him. He comes to her here twice or thrice a week, and\nshe receives him in the light closet up one pair of stairs, where he\nenjoys her in a taste, I suppose, peculiar to the heat, or perhaps the\ncaprices of his own country, I say no more, but to-morrow being his day,\nyou shall see what passes between them, from a place only known to your\nmistress and myself.\"\n\nYou may be sure, in the ply I was now taking, I had no objection to the\nproposal, and was rather a tip-toe for its accomplishments.\n\nAt five in the evening next day, Phoebe, punctual to her promise, came\nto me as I sat alone in my own room, and beckoned me to follow her.\n\nWe went down the back stairs very softly, and opening the door of a\ndark closet, where there was some old furniture kept, and some cases of\nliquor, she drew me in after her, and fastened the door upon us, we had\nno light but what came through a long crevice in the partition between\nours and the light closet, where the scene of action lay; so that\nsitting on those low cases, we could, with the greatest ease, as well as\nclearness, see all objects (ourselves unseen), only by applying our\neyes close to the crevice, where the moulding of a panel had warped, or\nstarted a little on the other side.\n\nThe young gentleman was the first person I saw, with his back directly\ntowards me, looking at a print. Polly was not yet come: in less than a\nminute though, the door opened, and she came in; and at the noise the\ndoor made he turned about, and come to meet her, with an air of the\ngreatest tenderness and satisfaction.\n\nAfter saluting her, he led her to a coach that fronted us, where they\nboth sat down, and the young Genoes helped her to a glass of wine, with\nsome Naples biscuits on a salver.\n\nPresently, when they had exchanged a few kisses, and questions in broken\nEnglish on one side, he began to unbutton, and, in fine, stript unto his\nshirt.\n\nAs if this had been the signal agreed on for pulling off all their\nclothes, a scheme which the heat of the season perfectly favoured, Polly\nbegan to draw her pins, and as she had no stays to unlace, she was in a\ntrice, with her gallant's officious assistance, undressed to all but her\nshift.\n\nWhen he saw this, his breeches were immediately loosened, waist and\nknee bands, and slipped over his ankles, clean off; his shirt collar was\nunbottoned too: then, first giving Polly an encouraging kiss, he stole,\nas it were, the shift off the girl, who being, I suppose, broke and\nfamiliarized to this humour, blushed indeed, but less than I did at the\napparition of her, now standing stark naked, just as she came ont of\nthe hands of pure nature, with her black hair loose and a-float down her\ndazzling white neck and shoulders, whilst the deepened carnation of her\ncheeks went off gradually into the hue of glazed snow: for such were the\nblended tints polish of her skin.\n\nThis girl could not be above eighteen: her face regular and sweet\nfeatured, her shape exquisite; nor could I help envying her two ripe\nenchanting breasts, finely plumped out in flesh, but withal so round, so\nfirm, that they sustained themselves, in scorn of any stay: then their\nnipples, pointing different ways, marked their pleasing separation;\nbeneath them lay the delicious tract of the belly, which terminated in\na parting of rift scarce discerning, that modesty seemed to retire\ndownward, and seek shelter between two plump fleshy thighs: the curling\nhair that overspread its delightful front, clothed it with the richest\nsable fur in the universe: in short, she was evidently a subject for the\npainters to court her, sitting to them for a pattern female beauty, in\nall the true pride and pomp of nakedness.\n\nThe young Italian (still in his shirt) stood gazing and transported at\nthe sight of beauties that might have fired a dying hermit; his eager\neyes devoured her, as she shifted attitudes at his discretion: neither\nwere his hands excluded their share of the high feast, but wandered, on\nthe hunt of pleasure, over every part and inch of her body, so qualified\nto afford the most exquisite sense of it.\n\nIn the mean time time, one could not help observing the swell of his\nshirt before, that bolstered out, and pointed out the condition of\nthings behind the curtain: but he soon removed it, by slipping his shirt\nover his head; and now, as to nakedness, they had nothing to reproach\none another.\n\nThe young gentleman, by Phoebe's guess, was about two and twenty; tall\nand well limbed. His body was finely formed, and of a most vigorous\nmake, square shouldered, and broad chested: his face was not remarkable\nany way, but for a nose inclining to the Roman, eyes large, black, and\nsparkling, and a ruddiness in his cheeks that was the more a grace; for\nhis complexion was of the brownest, not of that dusky dun colour which\nexcludes, the idea of freshness, but of that clear, olive gloss, which\nglowing with life, dazzles perhaps less than fairness, and yet pleases\nmore, when it pleases at all. His hair being too short to tie fell no\nlower than his neck, in short easy curls; and he had a few sprigs about\nhis paps, that garnished his chest in a style of strength and manliness.\nThen his grand movement, which seemed to rise out of a thicket of\ncurling hair, that spread from the root all over his thighs and belly up\nto the navel, stood stiff and upright, but of a size to frighten me, by\nsympathy for the small tender part which was the object of its fury,\nand which now lay exposed to my fairest view; for he had, immediately\non stoppings off his shirt, gently pushed her down on the couch, which\nstood conveniently to break her willing fall. Her thighs were spread out\nto their utmost extention, and discovered between them the mark of the\nsex, the red-centered cleft of flesh, whose lips vermillioning inwards,\nexpressed a small ruby line in sweet miniature, such as Guide's touch or\ncolouring: could never attain to the life or delicacy of.\n\nPhoebe, at this, gave me a gentle jog, to prepare me for a whisper\nquestion: \"Whether I thought my little maiden-head was much less?\" But\nmy attention was too much engrossed, too much inwrapped with all I saw,\nto be able to give her any answer.\n\nBy this time the young gentelman had changed her posture from lying\nbreadth to length-wise on the coach: but her thighs were still spread,\nand the mark lay fair for him, who now kneeling between them, displayed\nto us a side view of that fierce erect machine of his, which threatened\nno less than splitting the tender victim, who lay smiling at the\nuplifted stroke, nor seemed to decline it. He looked upon his weapon\nhimself with some pleasure, and guiding it with his hand to the\ninviting; slit, drew aside the lips, and lodged it (after some thrusts,\nwhich Polly seemed even to assist) about half way; but there it stuck, I\nsuppose from its growing thickness: he draws it again, and just wetting\nit with spittle, re-enters, and with ease sheathed it now up to the\nhilt, at which Polly gave a deep sigh, which was quite another tone than\none of pain; he thrusts, she heaves, at first gently, and in a regular\ncadence; but presently the transport began to be too violent to observe\nany order or measure; their motions were too rapid, their kisses too\nfierce' and fervent for nature to support such fury long: both seemed to\nme out of themselves: their eyes darted fires: \"Oh! oh! I can't bear it.\nIt is too much. I die. I am going,\" were Polly's expressions of extasy:\nhis joys were more silent: but soon broken murmurs, sighs heart-fetched,\nand at length a dispatching thrust, as if he would have forced himself\nup her body, and then the motionless languor of all his limbs, all\nshewed that the die-away moment was come upon him; which she gave signs\nof joining with by, the wild throwing of her hands about, closing her\neyes, and giving a deep sob, in which she seemed to expire in an agony\nof bliss.\n\nWhen he had finished his stroke, and got from off her, she lay still\nwithout the least motion, breathless, as it should seem, with pleasure.\nHe replaced her again breadth-wise on the couch, unable to sit up, with\nher thighs open, between which I could observe a kind of white liquid,\nlike froth, hanging about the outward lips of that recently opened\nwound, which now glowed with a deeper red. Presently she gets up, and\nthrowing her arms round him, seemed far undelighted with the trial he\nhad put her to, to judge, at least by the fondness with which she eyed,\nand hung upon him.\n\nFor my part, I will not pretend to describe what I felt over me during\nthis scene; but from that instant, adieu all fears of what man can\ndo unto me! they were now changed into such ardent desires, such\nungovernable longings, that I could have by the sleeve, and offered him\nthe bauble, which I now imagined the loss of would be a gain I could not\ntoo soon procure myself.\n\nPhoebe, who had more experience, and to whom such sights were not so\nnew, could not however, be unmoved at so warm a scene; and drawing me\naway softly from the peeping hole, for fear of being overheard, guided\nme as the door as possible, all passive and obedient to her least\nsignals.\n\nHere was no room either to sit or lie, but making me stand with my back\ntowards the door, she lifted up my petticoats, and with her busy fingers\nfell to visit and explore that part of me, where I was perfectly sick\nand ready to die with desire; that the bare touch of her finger, in\nthat critical place, had the effect of a fire to a train, and her hand\ninstantly made her sensible to what a pitch I was wound up, and melted\nby the sight she had thus procured me. Satisfied then with her success,\nin allaying a heat that would have made me impatient of seeing the\ncontinuation of the transactions between our amourous couple, she\nbrought me again to the crevice, so favourable to our curiosity.\n\nWe had certainly been but a few instants away from it, and yet on our\nreturn we saw everything in good forwardness for recommencing the tender\nhostilities.\n\nThe young foreigner was sitting down, fronting us, on the coach, with\nPolly upon one knee, who had her arms round his neck, whilst the extreme\nwhiteness of her skin was not undelightfully contrasted by the smooth\nglossy brown of her lover's.\n\nBut who could count the fierce, unnumbered kisses given and taken?\nIn which I could often discover their mouths were double tongued,\nand seemed to favour the mutual insertion with the greatest gust and\ndelight.\n\nIn the meantime, his red-headed champion, that had so lately fled the\npit, quelled and abashed, was now recovered to the top of his condition,\nperked and crested up between Polly's thighs, who was not wanting, on\nher part, to coax and keep it in good humour, stroking it, with her\nhead down, and receiving even its velvet tip between the lips of not\nits proper mouth: whether it was to render it more glib and easy of\nentrance, I could not tell; but it had such an effect, that the young\ngentleman seemed by his eyes, that sparkled with more excited lustre,\nand his inflamed countenance, to receive increase of pleasure. He got\nup, and taking Polly in his arms, embraced her, and said something too\nsoftly for me to hear, leading her withal to the foot of the couch, and\ntaking delight to slap her thighs and posteriors with that stiff sinew\nof his, which hit them with a spring that he gave it with his hand, and\nmade them resound again, but her about as much as he meant to hurt her,\nfor she seemed to have as frolic a taste as himself.\n\nBut guess my surprise, when I saw the lazy young rogue lie down on his\nback, and gently pull down Polly upon him, who giving way to his humour,\nstradled, and with her hands conducted her blind favourite to the right\nplace; and following her impulse, ran directly upon the flaming point of\nthis weapon of pleasure, which she staked herself upon, up pierced, and\ninfixed to the extremest hair breadth of it: thus she sat on him a few\ninstants, enjoying and relishing her situation, whilst he toyed with\nher provoking breasts. Sometimes she would stoop to meet his kiss: but\npresently the sting of pleasure spurred them up to fiercer action; then\nbegan the storm of heaves, which, from the undermost combatant, were\nthrust at the same time, he crossing his hands over her, and drawing\nher home to him with a sweet violence: the inverted strokes of anvil\nover hammer soon brought on the critical period, in which all the signs\nof a close conspiring extasy informed us of the point they were at.\n\nFor me, I could bear to see no more; I was so overcome, so inflamed at\nthe second part of the same play, that, mad to an intolerable degree,\nI hugged, I clasped Phoebe, as if she had wherewithal to relieve me.\nPleased however with, and pitying the taking she could feel me in, she\ndrew towards the door, and opening it softly as she could, we both got\noff undiscovered, and reconducted me to my own room, where, unable to\nkeep my legs, in the agitation I was in, I instantly threw myself down\non the bed, where I lay transported, though ashamed at what I felt.\n\nPhoebe lay down by me, and asked me archly, \"if, now that I had seen\nthe enemy, and fully considered him, I was still afraid of him? or did\nI think I could come to a close engagement with him?\" To all which, not a\nword on my side; I sighed, and could scarcely breathe. She takes hold\nof my hand, and having rolled up her own petticoats, forced it half\nstrivingly, towards those parts, where, now grown more knowing, I missed\nthe main object of my wishes; and finding not even the shadow of what I\nwanted, where every thing was so fiat, or so hollow, in the vexation\nI was in at it. I should have withdrawn my hand, but for fear of\ndisobliging her. Abandoning it then entirely to her management, she made\nuse of it as she thought proper, to procure herself rather the shadow\nthan the substance of any pleasure. For my part, I now pined for more\nsolid food, and promised tacitly to myself that I would not be put off\nmuch longer with this foolery of woman to woman, of Mrs. Brown did not\nsoon provide me with the essential specific. In short, I had all the air\nof not being able to wait the arrival of my lord B----, though he was\nnow expected in a very fews days: nor did I wait for him, for love\nitself took charge of the disposal of me, in spite of interest, or gross\nlust.\n\nIt was now two days after the closet scene, that I got up about six in\nthe morning, and leaving my bedfellow fast asleep, stole down, with no\nother thought than of taking a little fresh air in a small garden, which\nour back parlour opened into, and from which my confinement debarred me,\nat the times company came to my house; but now sleep and silence reigned\nall over it.\n\nI opened the parlour door, and well surprised was I at seeing, by the\nside of a fire half-out, a young gentleman in the old lady's elbow\nchair, with his legs laid upon another, fast asleep, and left there by\nhis thoughtless companions, who had drank him down, and then went off\nwith every one but his mistress, whilst he stayed behind by the courtesy\nof the old matron, who would not disturb or turn him out in that\ncondition at one in the morning; and beds, it is more than probable\nthere were none to spare. On the table still remained the punch bowl and\nglasses, stewed about in their usual disorder after a drunken revel.\n\nBut when I drew nearer, to view the sleeping estray, heavens! what\na sight! No! term of years, no turn of fortune could ever eraze the\nlightninglike impression his form made on me. Yes! dearest object of\nmy earliest passion, I command for ever the remembrance of thy first\nappearance to my ravished eyes, it calls thee up, present; and I see\nthee now.\n\nFigure to yourself, Madam, fair stripling between eighteen and nineteen,\nwith his head reclined on one of the sides of the chair, his hair\ndisordered curls, irregularly shading a face, on which all the roseate\nbloom of youth and all the manly graces conspired to fix my eye\nsand heart; even the languour and paleness of his face, in which the\nmomentary triumph of the lily over the rose was owing to the excesses\nof the night, gave an inexpressible sweetness to the finest features\nimaginable: his eyes, closed in sleep, displayed the meeting edges of\ntheir lids beautifully bordered with long eye-lashes; over which no\npencil could have described two more regular arches than those that\ngraced his forehead, which was high, perfectly white and smooth; then a\npair of vermilion lips, pouting and swelling to the touch, as if a bee\nhad freshly stung them, seemed to challenge me to get the gloves off\nthis lovely sleeper, had not the modesty and respect, which in both\nsexes are inseparable from a true passion, checked my impulses.\n\nBut on seeing his shirt collar unbottoned, and bosom whiter than a drift\nof snow, the pleasure of considering it could not bribe me to lengthen\nit, at the hazard of a health that began to be my life's concern. Love,\nthat made me timid, taught me to be tender too: with a trembling hand\nI took hold of one of his, and waking him as gently as possible, he\nstarted, and looking, at first a little wildly, said with a voice that\nsent its harmonious sound to my heart: \"Pray, child, what-a-clock is\nit?\" I told him, and added that he might catch cold if he slept longer\nwith his breast open in the cool of the morning air. On this he thanked\nme with a sweetness perfectly agreeing with that of his features and\neyes; the last now broad open, and eagerly surveying me, carried the\nsurightly fires they sparkled with directly to my heart.\n\nIt seems, that having drank too freely before he came upon the rake with\nsome of his young companions, he had put himself out of a condition to\ngo through all the weapons with them, and crown the night with a getting\na mistress; so that seeing me in a loose undress, he did not doubt but I\nwas one of the misses of the house, sent in to repair his loss of time;\nbut though he seized that notion, and a very obvious one it was, without\nhesitation, yet, whether my figure made a more than ordinary impression\non him, or whether it was his natural politeness, he addressed me in\na manner far from rude, though still on the foot of one of the house\npliers come to amuse him; and giving me the first kiss that I ever\nrelished from man in my life, asked me if I could favour him with my\ncompany, assuring me that he would make it worth my while: but had\nnot even new-born love, that true refiner of lust, opposed so sudden a\nsurrender, the fear of being surprised by the house was a sufficient bar\nto my compliance.\n\nI told him then, in a tone set by love itself, that for reasons I had\nnot time to explain to him. I could not stay with him, and might even\never see him again, with a sigh at these words, which broke from the\nbottom of my heart. My conqueror, who, as he afterwards told me, had\nbeen struck with my appearance, and liked me as much as he could think\nof liking any one in my supposed way of life, asked me briskly at once,\nif I would be kept by him, and that he would take a lodging for me\ndirectly, and relieve me from any engagements he presumed I might be\nunder to the house.\n\nRash, sudden, undigested, even dangerous as this offer might be from a\nperfect stranger, and that stranger a giddy boy, the prodigious love\nI was struck with for him, had put a charm into every objection: I not\nresisting, and blinded me to every objection; I could, at that instant,\nhave died for him: think if I could resist an invitation to live with\nhim! Thus my heart, beating strong to the proposal, dictated my answer,\nafter scarce a minute's pause, that I would accept of his offer, and\nmake my escape to him in what way he pleased, and that I would be\nentirely at his disposal, let it be good or bad. I have often since\nwondered that so great an easiness did not disgust him, or make me too\ncheap in his eyes, but my fate had so appointed it, that in his fears of\nthe hazzard of the town, he had been some time looking out for a girl to\ntake into keeping, and my person happening to hit his fancy, it was by\none of those miracles reserved to love, that we struck the bargain in\nthe instant, which we sealed by an exchange of kisses, that the hopes of\na more uninterrupted enjoyment engaged him to content himself with.\n\nNever, however, did dear youth carry in his head more wherewith\nto justify the turning of a girl's head, and making her set all\nconsequences at defiance, for the sake of following a gallant.\n\nFor, besides all the perfections of manly beauty which were assembled in\nhis form, he had an air of neatness and gentility, certain smartness in\nthe carriage and port of his head, that yet more distinguished him; his\neyes were sprightly and full of meaning; his looks had in them something\nat once sweet and commanding; his complexion out-bloomed the lovely\ncoloured rose, whilst its inimitable tender vivid glow clearly saved\nit from the reproach of wanting life, of raw and dough-like, which is\ncommonly made of those so extremely fair as he was.\n\nOur little plan was, that I should get out about seven the next morning\n(which I could readily promise, as I knew where to get the key of the\nstreet door) and he would wait at the end of the street with a coach\nto convey me safe off; after which, we would send, and clear any debt\nincurred by my stay at Mrs. Brown's, who, he only judged, in gross,\nmight not care to part with one, he thought, so fit to draw custom to\nthe house.\n\nI then just hinted to him not to mention in the house his having seen\nsuch a person as me, for reasons I would explain to him more at leisure.\nAnd then, for fear of miscarrying, by being seen together, I tore myself\nfrom him with a bleeding heart, and stole up softly to my room, where\nI found Phoebe still fast asleep, and hurrying off my few clothes,\nlay down by her, with a mixture of joy and anxiety, that may be easier\nconceived than expressed.\n\nThe risks of Mrs. Brown's discovering my purpose, of disappointments,\nmisery, ruin, all vanished before this new-kindled flame. The seeing,\nthe touching, the being, if but for a night, with this idol of my\nfond virgin heart, appeared to me a happiness above the purchase of my\nliberty or life. He might use me ill, let him: he was the master, happy,\ntoo happy, even to receive death at so dear a hand.\n\nTo this purpose were the reflections of the whole day, of which every\nminute seemed to me a little eternity. How often did I visit the clock!\nnay, was tempted to advance the tedious hand, as if that would have\nadvanced the time with it! Had those of the house had the least\nobservations on me, they must have remarked something extraordinary from\nthe discomposure I could not help betraying; especially when at dinner\nmention was made of the charmingest youth having been there, and stayed\nbreakfast. \"Oh! he was such a beauty!... I should have died for him!...\nthey would pull caps for him!...\" and the like fooleries; which,\nhowever, was throwing oil on a fire I was sorely put to it to smother\nthe blaze of.\n\nThe fluctuations of my mind, the whole day, produced one good effect:\nwhich was, that, through mere fatigue, I slept tolerably well till five\nin the morning, when I got up, and having dressed myself, waited, under\nthe double tortures of fear and impatience, for the appointed hour.\nIt came at last, the dear, critical, dangerous hour came; and now,\nsupported only by the courage love lent me, I ventured, a tip-toe, down\nstairs, leaving my box behind, for fear of being surprized with it in\ngoing out.\n\nI got to the street door, the key whereof was always laid on the\nchair by our bed side, in trust with Phoebe, who having not the least\nsuspicion of my entertaining any design to go from them (nor, indeed,\nhad I, but the day before), made no reserve or concealment of it from\nme. I opened the door with great ease; love, that emboldened, protected\nme too: and now, got safe into the street, I saw my new guardian angel\nwaiting at a coach door, ready open. How I got to him I know not: I\nsuppose I flew; but I was in the coach in a trice, and he by the side of\nme, with his arms clasped round me, and giving me the kiss of welcome.\nThe coachman had his orders, and drove to them.\n\nMy eyes were instantly filled with tears, but tears of the most\ndelicious delight; to find myself in the arms of that beauteous youth,\nwas a rapture that my little hear swam in; past or future were equally\nout of the question with me; the present was as much as all my powers\nof life were sufficient to bear the transport of, without fainting. Nor\nwere the most tender embraces, the most soothing expressions wanting\non his side, to assure me of his love, and of never giving me cause to\nrepent the bold step I had taken, in throwing myself thus entirely upon\nhis honour and generosity. But, alas! this was no merit in me, for I was\ndrove to it by a passion too impetuous for me to resist, and, I did what\nI did, because I could not help it.\n\nIn an instant, for time was now annihilated with me, we were landed at a\npublic house in Chelsea, hospitably commodious for the reception of duet\nparties of pleasure, where a breakfast of chocolate was prepared for us.\n\nAn old jolly stager, who kept it, and understood life perfectly well,\nbreakfasted with us, and leering archly at me, gave us both joy, and\nsaid, \"we were well paired, i' faith! that a great many gentlemen and\nladies used his house, but he had never seen a handsomer couple... he\nwas sure I was a fresh piece... I looked so country, so innocent! well\nmy spouse was a lucky man!...\" all which, common landlord's cant, not\nonly pleased and soothed me, but helped to diver my confusion at being\nwith my new sovereign, whom, the minute approached, I began to fear to\nbe alone with: a timidity which true love had a greater share in than\neven maiden bashful-ness.\n\nI wished, I doated, I could have died for him; and yet, I know not how,\nor why I dreaded the point which had been the object of my fiercest\nwishes; my pulses beat fears, amidst a flush of the warmest desires.\nThis struggle of the passions, however, this conflict betwixt modesty\nand lovesick longings, made me burst again into tears; which he took, as\nhe had done before, only for the remains of concern and emotion at the\nsuddenness of my change of condition, in committing myself to his care;\nand, in consequence of that idea, did and said all that he thought would\nmost comfort and re-inspirit me.\n\nAfter breakfast, Charles (the dear familiar name I must take the liberty\nhenceforward to distinguish my Adonis by), with a smile full of meaning,\ntook me gently by the hand, and said: \"Come, my dear, I will show you\na room that commands a fine prospect over some gardens\"; and without\nwaiting for an answer, in which he relieved me extremely, he led me up\ninto a chamber, airy and lightsome, where all seeing of prospects was\nout of the question, except that of a bed, which had all the air of\nrecommending the room to him.\n\nCharles had just slipped the bolt of the door, and running, caught me in\nhis arms, and lifting me from the ground, with his lips glued to mine,\nbore me trembling, panting, dying with soft fears and tender wishes, to\nthe bed; where his impatience would not suffer him to undress me, more\nthan just unpinning my handkerchief and gowns, and unlacing my stays.\n\nMy bosom was now bare, and rising in the warmest throbs, presented to\nhis sight and feeling the firm hard swell of a pair of young breast,\nsuch as may be imagined of a girl not sixteen, fresh out of the country,\nand never before handled: but even their pride, whiteness, fashion,\npleasing resistance to the touch, could not bribe his restless hands\nfrom roving; but, giving them the loose, my petticoats and shift were\nsoon taken up, and their stronger center of attraction laid open to\ntheir tender invasion. My fears, however, made me mechanically close\nmy thighs; but the very touch of his hand insinuated between them,\ndisclosed them and opened a way for the main attack.\n\nIn the mean time, I lay fairly exposed to the examination of his eyes\nand hands, quiet and unresisting; which confirmed him the opinion he\nproceeded so cavalierly upon, that I was no novice in these matters,\nsince he had taken me out of a common bawdy house, nor had I said one\nthing to prepossess him of my virginity; and if I had, he would sooner\nhave believed that I took him for a cully that would swallow such an\nimprobability, than that I was still mistress of that darling treasure,\nthat hidden mine, so eagerly sought after by the men, and which they\nnever dig for, but to destroy.\n\nBeing now too high wound up to bear a delay, he unbuttoned, and drawing\nout the engine of love assaults, drove it currently, as at a ready\nmade breach... Then! then! for the first time, did I feel that stiff\nhorn-hard gristle, battering against the tender part; but imagine to\nyourself his surprise, when he found, after several vigorous pushes,\nwhich hurt me extremely, that he made not the least impression.\n\nI complained, but tenderly complained: \"I could not bear it... indeed\nhe hurt me!...\" Still he thought no more, than that being so young, the\nlargeness of his machine (for few men could dispute size with him) made\nall the difficulty; and that possibly I had not been enjoyed by any so\nadvantageously made in that part as himself: for still, that my virgin\nflower was yet un-cropped, never entered into his head, and he would\nhave thought it idling with time and words, to have questioned me upon\nit.\n\nHe tried again, still no admittance, still no penetration; but he had\nhurt me yet more, while my extreme love made me bear extreme pain,\nalmost without a groan. At length, after repeated fruitless trials, he\nlay down panting by me, kissed my falling tears, and asked me tenderly\n\"what was the meaning of so much complaining? and if I had not borne it\nbetter from other than I did from him?\" I answered, with a simplicity\nframed to persuade, that he was the first mam that ever served me so.\nTruth is powerful, and it is not always that we do not believe what we\neagerly wish.\n\nCharles, already disposed by the evidence, of his senses to think my\npretences to virginity not entirely apocryphal, smothers me with kisses,\nbegs me, in the-name of love, to have a little patience, and that he\nwilt be as tender of hurting me as he would be of himself..\n\nAlas! it was enough I knew his pleasure to submit joyfully to him,\nwhatever pain I foresaw it would cost, me.\n\nHe now resumes his attempts in more form: first, he put one of the\npillows under me, to give the blank of his aim a more favourable\nelevation, and another Under my head, in ease of it; then spreading my\nthighs, and placing himself standing betwen them, made them rest upon\nhis; applying then the point of his machine to the slit, into which he\nsought entrance, it was so small, he could scarce assure himself of its\nbeing rightly pointed. He looks, he feels, and satisfies himself:\nthere driving on with fury, its prodigious stiffness, thus impacted,\nwedgelike, breaks the union of those parts, and gained him just the\ninsertion of the tip of it, lip deep; which being sensible of, he\nimproved his advantage, and following well his stroke, in a straight\nline, forcibly deepens his penetration; but put me to such intolerable\npain, from the separation of the sides of that soft passage by a hard\nthick body, I could have screamed out; but, as I was unwilling to alarm\nthe house, I held in my breath, and crammed my petticoat, which was;\nturned up over my face, into my mouth, and bit it through in the agony.\nAt length, the tender texture of that tract giving way to such fierce\ntearing and rending, he pierced something further into me: and now,\noutrageous and no longer his own master, but borne headlong away by the\nfury and over-mettle of that member, now exerting itself with a kind\nof native rage, he breaks in, carries all before him, and one violent\nmerciless lunge, sent it, imbrued, and reeking with virgin blood, up\nto the very hilt in me... Then! then all my resolution deserted me: I\nscreamed out, and fainted away with the sharpness of the pain; and, as\nhe told me afterwards, on his drawing out, when emission was over with\nhim, my thighs were instantly all in a stream of blood, that flowed from\nthe wounded torn passage.\n\nWhen I recovered my senses, I found myself undressed and a-bed, in the\narms of the sweet relenting murderer of my virginity, who hung mourning\ntenderly over me, and holding in his hand a cordial, which, coming from\nthe still dear author of so much pain, I could not refuse; my eyes,\nhowever, moistened with tears, and languishingly turned upon him, seemed\nto reproach him with his cruelty, and ask him, if such were the rewards\nof love. But Charles, to whom I was now infinitely endeared by his\ncomplete triumph over a maidenhead, where he so little expected to find\none, in tenderness to that pain which he had put me to, in procuring\nhimself the height of pleasure, smothered his exultation, and employed\nhimself with so much sweetness, so much warmth, to sooth, to caress, and\ncomfort me in my soft complainings, which breathed, indeed, more love\nthan resentment, that I presently drowned all sense of pain in the\npleasure of seeing him, of thinking that I belonged to him: he who was\nnow the absolute disposer of my happiness, and, in one word, my fate.\n\nThe sore was, however, too tender, the wound too bleeding fresh, for\nCharles's good-nature to put my patience presently to another trial; but\nas I could not stir, or walk a-cross the room, he ordered the dinner\nto be brought to the bed side, where it could not be otherwise than my\ngetting down the wing of a fowl, and two or three glasses of wine, since\nit was my adored youth who both served, and urged them on me, with that\nsweet irresistible authority with which love had invested him over me.\n\nAfter dinner, and everything but the wine was taken away, Charles very\nimpudently asks a leave, he might read the grant of in my eyes, to come\nto bed to me, and accordingly falls to undressing; which I could not see\nthe progress of without strange emotions of fear and pleasure.\n\nHe is now in bed with me the first time, and in broad day; but when\nthrusting up his own shirt and my shift, he laid his naked glowing body\nto mine... oh insupportable delight! oh! superhuman rapture! what pain\ncould stand before a pleasure so transporting? I felt no more the smart\nof my wounds below; but, curling round him like the tendril of a vine,\nas if I feared any part of him should be untouched or unpressed by me, I\nreturned his strenuous embraces and kisses with a fervour and gust only\nknown to true love, and which mere lust never rise to.\n\nYes, even at this time, that all the tyranny of the passions is fully\nover, and that my veins roll no longer but a cold tranquil stream, the\nremembrance of those passages that most affected me in my youth, still\ncheers and refreshes me; let me proceed then. My beauteous youth was now\nglued to me in all the folds and twists that we could make our bodies\nmeet in; when, no longer able to rein in the fierceness of refreshed\ndesires, he gives his steed the head, and gently insinuating his thighs\nbetween mine, stopping my mouth with kisses of humid fire, makes a fresh\neruption, and renewing his thrusts, pierces, tears, and forces his way\nup the torn tender folds, that yielded him admission with a smart little\nless severe that when the breach was first made I stifled, however, my\ncries, and bore him with the passive fortitude of an heroine; soon his\nthrusts, more and more furious, cheeks flushed with a deeper scarlet,\nhis eyes turned up in the fervent fit, some dying sighs, and an\nagonizing shudder, announced the approaches of that extatic pleasure, I\nwas yet in too much pain to come in for my share of.\n\nNor was it till after a few enjoyments had numbed and blunted the\nsense of the smart, and given me to feel the titillating inspersion of\nbalsamic sweets, drew from me the delicious return, and brought down all\nmy passion, that I arrived at excess of pleasure through excess of pain.\nBut, when successive engagements had broke and inured me, I began to\nenter into the true unalloyed relish of that pleasure of pleasures, when\nthe warm gush darts through all the ravished inwards; what floods of\nbliss! what melting transports! what agonies of delight! too fierce,\ntoo mighty for nature to sustain?... well has she therefore, no doubt\nprovided the relief of a delicious momentary dissolution, the approaches\nof which are intimated by a dear delirium, a sweet thrill, on the point\nof emitting those liquid sweets, in which enjoyment itself is drowned,\nwhen one gives the languishing stretch out, and die at the discharge.\n\nHow often, when the rage and tumult of my senses had subsided, after\nthe melting flow, have I, in a tender meditation, asked myself cooly the\nquestion, if it was in nature for any of its creatures to be so happy as\nI was? Or, what were all fears of the consequence, put in the scale of\none night's enjoyment, of any thing so transcendently the taste of my\neyes and heart, as that delicious, fond, matchless youth.\n\nThus we spent the whole afternoon, till supper time in a continued\ncircle of love delights, kissing, turtle-billing, toying, and all the\nrest of the feast. At length, supper was served in, before which Charles\nhad, for I do not know what reason, slipped his clothes on; and sitting\ndown by the bed side, we made table and tablecloth of the bed and\nsheets, whilst he suffered nobody to attend or serve but himself. He\nate with a very good appetite, and seemed charmed to see me eat. For\nmy part, I was so transported with the comparison of the delights I\nnow swam in, with the insipidity of all my past scenes of life, that I\nthought them sufficiently cheap, at even the price of my ruin, or the\nrisk of their not lasting. The present possession was all my little head\ncould find room for.\n\nWe lay together that night, when, after playing repeated prizes of\npleasure, nature, overspent and satisfied, gave us up to the arms of\nsleep: those of my dear youth encircled me, the consciousness of which\nmade even that sleep more delicious.\n\nLate in the morning I waked, first; and observing my lover slept\nprofoundly, softly disengaged myself from his arms, scarcely daring to\nbreathe, for fear of shortening his repose; my cap, my hair, my shift,\nwere all in disorder, from the rufflings I had undergone; and I took\nthis opportunity to adjust and set them as well as I could: whilst,\nevery now and then, looking at the sleeping youth, with inconceivable\nfondness and delight, and reflecting on all the pain he had put me to,\ntacitly owned that the pleasure had overpaid me for my sufferings.\n\nIt was then broad day. I was sitting up in the bed, the clothes of\nwhich were all tossed, or rolled off, by the unquietness of our motions,\nfrom the sultry heat of the weather; nor could I refuse myself a\npleasure that solicited me so irresistibly, as this fair occasion of\nfeasting my sight with all those treasures of youthful beauty I had\nenjoyed, and which lay now almost entirely naked, his shirt being\ntrussed up in a perfect wisp, which the warmth of the season and room\nmade me easy about the consequence of. I hung over him enamoured indeed!\nand devoured all his naked charms with only two eyes, when I could have\nwished them at least an hundred for the fuller enjoyment of the gaze.\n\nOh! could I paint his figure as I see it now, still present to my\ntransported imagination! a whole length of an all perfect manly beauty\nin full view. Think of a face without a fault, glowing with all the\nopening bloom and verdant freshness of an age, in which beauty is of\neither sex, and which the first down over his upper lip scarce began to\ndistinguish.\n\nThe parting of the double ruby pout of his lips seemed to exhale an air\nsweeter and purer than what it drew in: ah! what violence did it not\ncost me to refrain the so tempted kiss!\n\nThen a neck exquisitely turned, graved behind and on the sides with fais\nhair, playing freely in natural ringlets, connected his head to a body\nof the most perfect form, and of the most vigorous contexture, in which\nall the strength of manhood was concealed, and softened to appearance\nby the delicacy of his complexion, the smoothness of his skin, and the\nplumpness of his flesh.\n\nThe platform of his snow white bosom, that was laid out in a manly\nproportion, presented, on the vermilion summit of each pap, the idea of\na rose about to blow.\n\nNor did his shirt hinder me from observing the symmetry of his limbs,\nthat exactness of shape, in the fall of it towards the loins, where the\nwaist ends and the rounding swell of the hips commences; where the skin,\nsleek, smooth, and dazzling white, burnishes on; the stretch-over firm,\nplump, ripe flesh, that crimped' and ran into dimples at the least\npressure, or that the touch could not rest upon, but slid over on the\nsurface of the most polished ivory.\n\nHis thighs, finely fashioned, and with a florid glossy roundness,\ngradually tapering away to the knees, seemed pillars worthy to support\nthat beauteous frame at the bottom of which I could not, without\nsome remains of terror, some tender emotions too, fix my eyes on that\nterrible machine, which had, not long before, with such fury broke into,\ntorn, and almost ruined those soft, tender parts of mine, that had not\nyet done smarting with the effects of its rage; but behold it now! crest\nfallen, reclining its half-caped vermilion head over one of his thighs,\nquiet, pliant, and to all appearances incapable of the mischiefs and\ncruelty it had committed. Then the beautiful growth of the hair, in\nshort and soft curls round its roots, its whiteness, branched veins, the\nsupple softness of the shaft, as it lay foreshortened, rolled and\nshrunk up into a squat thickness, languid, and borne up from between\nhis thighs, by its globular appendage, that wondrous treasure bag\nof nature's sweets, which revelled round, and pursed up in the\nonly wrinkles that are known to please, perfected the prospect, and\naltogether formed the most interesting moving picture in nature, and\nsurely infinitely superior to those nudities furnished by the painters,\nstatuaries, or any art, which are purchased at immense prices; whilst\nthe sight of them in actual life is scarce sovereignly tasted by any\nbut the few whom nature has endowed with a fire of imagination, warmly\npointed by a truth of judgment to the spring-head, the originals of\nbeauty, of nature's unequalled composition, above all the imitations of\nart, or the reach of wealth to pay their price.\n\nBut every thing must have an end. A motion made by this angelic youth,\nin the listlessness of goingoff sleep, replaced his shirt and the bed\nclothes in a posture that shut up that treasury from longer view.\n\nI lay down then, and carrying my hands to that part of me in which the\nobjects just seen had begun to raise a mutiny, that prevailed over the\nsmart of them, my fingers now opened themselves an easy passage; but\nlong I had not time to consider the wide difference there, between\nthe maid and the now finished woman, before Charles waked, and turning\ntowards me, kindly enquired how I had rested? and, scarce giving me time\nto answer, imprinted on my lips one of his burning rapture kisses, which\ndarted a flame to my heart, that from thence radiated to every part of\nme; and presently, as if he had proudly meant revenge for the survey I\nhad smuggled of all his naked beauties, he spurns off the bed clothes,\nand trussing up my shift as high as it would go, took his turn to feast\nhis eyes on all the gifts nature had bestowed on my person; his busy\nhands, too, ranged intemperately over every part of me. The delicious\nausterity and hardness of my yet unripe budding breasts, the whiteness\nand firmness of my flesh, the freshness and regularity of my features,\nthe harmony of my limbs, all seemed to confirm him in his satisfaction\nwith his bargain; but when curious to explore the havock he had made\nin the centre of his over fierce attack, he not only directed his hands\nthere, but with a pillow put under, placed me favourably for his\nwanton purpose of inspection. Then, who can express the fire his eyes\nglistened, his hands glowed with! whilst sighs of pleasure, and tender\nbroken exclamations, were all the praises he could utter. By this time\nhis machine, stiffly risen at me, gave me to see it in its highest state\nand bravery. He feels it himself, seems pleased at its condition, and,\nsmiling loves and graces, seizes one of my hands, and carries it, with\ngentle compulsion, to this pride of nature, and its richest master\npiece.\n\nI, struggling faintly, could not help feeling what I could not grasp, a\ncolumn of the whitest ivory, beautifully streaked with blue veins, and\ncarrying, fully un-capt, a head of the liveliest vermilion: no horn\ncould be harder or stiffer; yet no velvet more smooth or delicious to\nthe touch. Presently he guided my hand lower, to that part in which\nnature, and pleasure keep their stores in concert, so aptly fastened\nand hung on to the root of their first instrument and minister, that not\nimproperly he might be styled their purse-bearer too: there he made\nme feel distinctly, through their soft cover, the contents, a pair of\nroundish balls, that seemed to play within, and elude all pressure, but\nthe tenderest, from without.\n\nBut now this visit of my soft, warm hand, in those so sensible parts,\nhad put every thing into such ungovernable fury, disdaining all further\npreluding, and taking advantage of my commodious posture, he made the\nstorm fall where I scarce patiently expected, and where he was sure\nto lay it: presently, then, I felt the stiff intersection betwen the\nyielding, divided lips of the wound, now open for life; where the\nnarrowness no longer put me to intolerable pain, and afforded my lover\nno more difficulty than what heightened his pleasure, in the strict\nembrace of that tender, warm sheath, round the instrument it was so\ndelicately adjusted to, and which now cased home, so gorged me with\npleasure, that it perfectly suffocated me and took away my breath; then\nthe killing thrusts! the unnumbered kisses! every one of which was a joy\ninexpressible; and that joy lost in a crowd of yet greater blisses! But\nthis was a disorder too violent in nature to last long: the vessels, so\nstirred and intensely heated, soon boiled over, and for that time\nput out the fire; meanwhile all this dalliance and disport had so\nfar consumed the morning, that it became a kind of necessity to lay\nbreakfast and dinner into one.\n\nIn our calmer intervals Charles gave the following account of himself,\nevery tittle of which was true. He was the only son of a father, who,\nhaving a small post in the revenue, rather overlived his income, and had\ngiven this young gentleman a very slender education: no profession\nhad he bred him up to, but designed to provide for him in the army, by\npurchasing him an ensign's commission, that is to say, provided he could\nraise the money, or procure it by interest, either of which clauses was\nrather to be wished than hoped for by him. On no better a plan, however,\nhad his improvident father suffered this youth, a youth of great\npromise, to run up to the age of manhood, or near it at least, in next\nto idleness; and had, besides, taken no sort of pains to give him even\nthe common premonitions against the vices of the town, and the dangers\nof all sorts which wait the unexperienced and unwary in it. He lived at\nhome, and at discretion with his father, who himself kept a mistress;\nand for the rest, provided Charles did not ask him for money, he was\nindolently kind to him: he might lie out when he pleased, any excuse\nwould serve, and even his reprimands were so slight, that they carried\nwith them rather an air of connivance at the fault, than any serious\ncontrol or constraint. But, to supply his calls for money, Charles,\nwhose mother was dead, had, by her side, a grandmother, who doated\nupon him. She had a considerable annuity to live on, and very regularly\nparted with every shilling she could spare, to this darling of her's, to\nthe no little heart-burn of his father; who was vexed, not that she, by\nthis means, fed his son's extravagance, but that she preferred Charles\nto himself; and we shall too soon see what a fatal turn such a mercenary\njealousy could operate on the breast of a father.\n\nCharles was, however, by the means of his grandmother's lavish fondness,\nvery sufficiently enabled to keep a mistress, so easily contented as my\nlove made me; and my good fortune, for such I must ever call it, threw\nme in his way, in the manner above related, just as he was on the\nlook-out for one.\n\nAs to temper, the even sweetness of it made him seem born for domestic\nhappiness: tender, naturally polite, and gentle-manner'd; it could never\nbe his fault, if ever jars, or animosities ruffled a calm he was so\nqualified every way to maintain or restore. Without those great or\nshining qualities that constitute a genius, or are fit to make a noise\nin the world, he had all those humble ones that compose the softer\nsocial merit: plain common sense, set off with every grace of modesty\nand good nature, made him, if not admired, what is much happier:\nuniversally beloved and esteemed. But, as nothing but the beauties\nof his person had at first attracted my regard and fixed my passion,\nneither was I then a judge of the internal merit, which I had afterwards\nfull occasion to discover, and which, perhaps, in that season of\ngiddiness and levity, would have touched my heart very little, had it\nbeen lodged in a person less the delight of my eyes, and idol of my\nsenses. But to return to our situation.\n\nAfter dinner, which we ate a-bed in most voluptuous disorder, Charles\ngot up, and taking a passionate leave of me for a few hours, went to\ntown, where concerting matters with a young sharp lawyer, they went\ntogether to my late venerable mistress's, from whence I had, but the\nday before, made my elopement, and with whom he was determined to settle\naccounts, in a manner that should cut off all after reckonings from that\nquarter.\n\nAccordingly they went; but by the way, the Templar, his friend, on\nthinking over Charles's information, saw reason to give their visit\nanother turn, and, instead of offering satisfaction, to demand it.\n\nOn being let in, the girls of the house flocked round Charles, whom they\nknew, and from the earlyness of my escape, and their perfect ignorance\nof his ever having so much as seen me, not having the least suspicion of\nhis being accessory to my flight, they were, in their way, making up to\nhim; and as to his companion, they took him probably for a fresh cully.\nBut the Templar soon checked their forwardness, by enquiring for the old\nlady, with whom he said, with a grave-like countenance, that he had some\nbusiness to settle.\n\nMadam was immediately sent for down, and the ladies being desired to\nclear the room, the lawyer asked her, severely, if she did know, or had\nnot decoyed, under pretence of hiring as a servant, a young girl, just\ncome out of the country, called Frances or Fanny Hill, describing me\nwithal as particularly as he could from Charlie's description.\n\nIt is peculiar to vice to tremble at the enquiries of justice; and\nMrs. Brown, whose conscience was not entirely clear upon my account,\nas knowing as she was of the town as hackneyed as she was in bluffing\nthrough all the dangers of her vocation, could not help being alarmed at\nthe questions, especially when he went on to talk of a Justice of peace,\nNewgate, the Old Bailey, indictments for keeping a disorderly house,\npillory, carting, and the whole process of that nature. She, who, it is\nlikely, imagined I had lodged an information against her house, looked\nextremely blank, and began to make a thousand protestations and excuses.\nHowever, to abridge, they brought away triumphantly my box of things,\nwhich, had she not ben under an awe, she might have disputed with them;\nand not only that, but a clearance and discharge of any demands on the\nhouse, at the expense of no more than a bowl of arrack-punch, the\ntreat of which, together with the choice of the house conveniences,\nwas offered and not accepted. Charles all the time acted the chance\ncompanion of the lawyer, who had brought him there, as he knew the\nhouse, and appeared in no wise interested in the issue; but he had the\ncollateral pleasure of hearing all that I told him verified, as far as\nthe bawd's fears would give her leave to enter into my history, which,\nif one may guess by the composition she so readily came into, were not\nsmall.\n\nPhoebe, my kind tutoress Phoebe, was at the time gone out, perhaps in\nsearch of me, or their cooked-up story had not, it is probable, passed\nsmoothly.\n\nThis negociation had, however, taken up some time, which would have\nappeared much longer to me, left as I was, in a strange house, if the\nlandlady, a motherly sort of a woman, to whom Charles had liberally\nrecommended me, had not come up and borne me company. We drank tea, and\nher chat helped to pass away the time very agreeably, since he was our\ntheme; but as the evening deepened, and the hour set for his return was\nelapsed, I could not dispel the gloom of impatience, and tender fears\nwhich gathered upon me, and which our timid sex are apt to feel in\nproportion to their love.\n\nLong, however, I did not suffer: the sight of him over-paid me; and the\nsoft reproach I had prepared for him, expired before it reached my lips.\n\nI was still a-bed, yet unable to use my legs otherwise than awkwardly,\nand Charles flew to me, catches me in his arms, raised and extending\nmine to meet his dear embrace, and gives me an account, interrupted by\nmany a sweet parenthesis of kisses, of the success of his measures.\n\nI could not help laughing at the fright of the old woman had been put\ninto, which my ignorance, and indeed my want of innocence, had far from\nprepared me from bespeaking. She had, it seems, apprehended that I fled\nthe shelter to some relation I had recollected in town, on my dislike\nof their ways and proceedings towards me, and that this application came\nfrom thence; for, as Charles had rightly judged, not one neighbour had,\nat that still hour, seen the circumstance of my escape into the coach,\nor, at least, noticed him; neither had any in the house, the least hint\nof suspicion of my having spoken to him, much less of my having clapt\nup such a sudden bargain with a perfect stranger, thus the greatest\nimprobability is not always what we should most mistrust.\n\nWe supped with all the gaiety of two young giddy creatures at the top of\ntheir desires; and as I had given up to Charles the whole charge of my\nfuture happiness, I thought of nothing beyond the exquisite pleasure of\npossessing him.\n\nHe came to bed in due time; and this second night, the pain being pretty\nwell over, I tasted, in full draught, all the transports of perfect\nenjoyment: I swam, I bathed in bliss, till both fell asleep, through the\nnatural consequences of satisfied desires, and appeased flames; nor did\nwe wake but to renewed raptures.\n\nThus, making the most of love, and life did we stay in this lodging\nin Chelsea about ten days; in which time Charles took care to give his\nexcursions from home a favourable gloss, and to keep his footing\nwith his fond indulgent grand-mother, from whom he drew constant and\nsufficient supplies for the charge I was to him, and which was very\ntrifling, in comparison with his former less regular course of pleasure.\n\nCharles removed me then to a private ready furnished lodging in D....\nstreet, St. James's, where he paid half a guinea a week for two rooms\nand a closet on the second floor, which he had been some time looking\nout for, and was more convenient for the frequency of his visits, than\nwhere he had at first placed me, in a house, which I cannot say but\nI left with regret, as it was infinitely endeared to me by the first\npossession of my Charles, and the circumstance of losing, there, that\njewel, which can never be twice lost. The landlord, however, had no\nreason to complain of any thing, but of a procedure in Charles too\nliberal not to make him regret the loss of us.\n\nArrived at our new lodging, I remember I thought them extremely fine,\nthough ordinary enough, even at that price; but, had it been a dungeon\nthat Charles had brought me to, his presence would have made a little\nVersailles.\n\nThe landlady, Mrs. Jones, waited on us to our apartment, and with great\nvolubility of tongue, explained to us all its conveniences: \"that her\nown maid should wait on us... that the best of quality had lodged at\nher house... that her first floor was let to a foreign secretary of an\nembassy, and his lady... that I looked like a very good natured lady...\"\nAt the word lady, I blushed out of flattered vanity: this was strong\nfor a girl of my condition; for though Charles had the precaution of\ndressing me in a less tawdry flaunting style than were the clothes I\nescaped to him in, and of passing me for his wife, that she had secretly\nmarried, and kept private (the old story) on account of his friends, I\ndare swear this appeared extremely apocryphal to a woman who knew the\ntown so well as she did; but that was the least of her concern: it was\nimpossible to be less scruple-ridden than she was; and the advantage of\nletting her rooms being her sole object, the truth itself would have far\nfrom scandalized her, or broke her bargain.\n\nA sketch of her picture, and personal history, will dispose you to\naccount for the part she is to act in my concern.\n\nShe was about forty six years old, tall, meagre, red-haired, with one\nof those trivial ordinary faces you meet with every where, and go\nabout unheeded and un-mentioned. In her youth she had been kept by a\ngentleman, who, dying, left her forty pounds a year during her life, in\nconsideration of a daughter he had by her: which daughter, at the age\nof seventeen, she sold, for not a very considerable sum neither, to a\ngentleman who was going on envoy abroad, and took his purchase with him,\nwhere he used her with the utmost tenderness, and it is thought, was\nsecretly married to her: but had constantly made a point of her not\nkeeping up the least correspondence with a mother base enough to make a\nmarket of her own flesh and blood. However, as she had not nature,\nnor, indeed, any passion but that of money, this gave her no further\nuneasiness, then, as she thereby lost a handle of squeezing pres-sents,\nor other after-advantages, out of the bargain. Indifferent then, by\nnature of constitution, to every other pleasure but that of increasing\nthe lump, by any means whatever, she commenced a kind of private\nprocuress, for which she was not amiss fitted, by her grave decent\nappearance, and sometimes did a job in the match-making way; in short,\nthere was, nothing that appeared to her under the shape of gain, that\nshe would not have undertaken. She knew most of the ways of the town,\nhaving not only herself been upon, but kept up constant intelligences in\npromoting a harmony between the two sexes, in private pawn-broking, and\nother profitable secrets. She rented the house she lived in, and made\nthe most of it, by letting it out in lodgings; though she was worth, at\nleast, near three or four thousand pounds, she would not allow herself\neven the necessaries, of life, and pinned her subsistence entirely on\nwhat she could squeeze out of her lodgers.\n\nWhen she saw such a young pair come under her roof, her immediate\nnotions, doubtless, were how she should make the most money of us, by\nevery means that money might be made, and which, she rightly judged, our\nsituations and inexperience would soon beget her occasions of.\n\nIn this hopeful sanctuary, and under the clutches of this harpy, did\nwe pitch our residence. It will not be might material to you, or very\npleasant to me, to enter into a detail of all the petty cut-throat ways\nand means with which she used to fleece us; all which Charles indolently\nchose to bear with, rather than take the trouble of removing, the\ndifference of expense being scarce attended to by a young gentleman who\nhad no ideas of stint, or even economy, and a raw country girl who knew\nnothing of the matter.\n\nHere, however, under the wings of my sovereignly beloved, did the most\ndelicious hours of my life flow on; my Charles I had, and, in him,\nevery thing my fond heart could wish or desire. He carried me to plays,\noperas, masquerades, and every diversion of the town; all which pleased\nme, indeed, but pleased me infinitely the more for his being with me,\nand explaining every thing to me, and enjoying perhaps, the natural\nimpressions of surprise and admiration, which such sights, at the first,\nnever fail to excite in a country girl, new to the delights of them; but\nto me, they sensibly proved the power and dominion of the sole passion\nof my heart over me, a passion in which soul and body were concentered,\nand left me no room for any other relish of life but love.\n\nAs to the men I saw at those places, or at any other, they suffered so\nmuch in the comparison my eyes made of them with my all-perfect Adonis,\nthat I had not the infidelity even of one wandering thought to reproach\nmyself with upon his account. He was the universe to me, and all that\nwas not him, was nothing to me.\n\nMy love, in fine, was so excessive, that is arrived at annihilating\nevery suggestion or kindling spark of jealousy; for, one idea only,\ntending that way, gave me such exquisite torment, that my self-love, and\ndread of worse than death, made me for ever renounce and defy it: nor\nhad I, indeed, occasion; for, were I to enter here on the recital of\nseveral instances wherein Charles sacrificed to me women of much greater\nimportance than I dare hint (which, considering his form, was no such\nwonder), I might, indeed, give you full proof of his unshaken constancy\nto me; but would not you accuse me of warming up against a feast, which\nmy vanity ought long ago to have been satisfied with?\n\nIn our cessations from active pleasure, Charles framed himself one, in\ninstructing me, as far as his own lights reached, in a great many\npoints of life, that I was, in consequence of my no-education, perfectly\nignorant of: nor did I suffer one word to fall in vain from the mouth of\nmy lovely teacher: I hung on every syllable he uttered, and received,\nas oracles, all he said; whilst kisses were all the interruption I could\nnot refuse myself the pleasure of admitting, from lips that breathed\nmore than Arabian sweetness, I was in a little time enabled, by the\nprogress I had made, to prove the deep regard I had paid to all that he\nhad said to me: repeating it to him almost word for word; and to shew\nthat I was not entirely the parrot, but that I reflected upon, that I\nentered into it, I joined my own comments, and asked him questions of\nexplanation.\n\nMy country accent, and the rusticity of my gait, manners, and\ndeportment, began now sensibly to wear off: so quick was my observation,\nand so efficacious my desire of growing every day worthier of his heart.\n\nAs to money, though, he brought me constantly all he received, it was\nwith difficulty he even got me to give it room in my bureau; and what\nclothes I had, he could prevail on me to accept of on no other foot,\nthan that of pleasing him by the greater neatness in my dress, beyond\nwhich I had no ambition. I could have made a pleasure of the greatest\ntoil, and worked my fingers to the bone, with joy, to have supported\nhim: guess, then, if I could harbour any idea of being burthensome to\nhim, and this disinterested turn in me was so unaffected, so much the\ndictate of my heart, that Charles could not but feel it: and if he did\nnot love me as much as I did him (which was the constant and only matter\nof sweet contention between us), he managed so, at least, as to give me\nthe satisfaction of believing it impossible for man to be more tender,\nmore true, more faithful than he was.\n\nOur landlady, Mrs. Jones, came frequently up to my apartment, from\nwhence I never stirred on any pretext without Charles; nor was it\nlong before she wormed out, without much art, the secret of our having\ncheated the church of a ceremony, and, in course, of the terms we lived\ntogether upon; a circumstance which far from displeased her, considering\nthe designs she had upon me, and which, alas! she will have too soon,\nroom to carry into execution. But in the meantime, her own experience\nof life let her see, that any attempt, however indirect or disguised,\nto divert or break, at least presently, so strong a cement of hearts\nas ours was, could only end in losing two lodgers, of whom she had made\nvery competent advantages, if either of us came to smoke her commission,\nfor a commission she had from one of her customers, either to debauch,\nor get me away from my keeper at any rate.\n\nBut the barbarity of my fate soon saved her the task of disuniting us.\nI had now been eleven months with this life of my life, which had passed\nin one continued rapid stream of delight: but nothing so violent was\never made to last. I was about three months gone with a child by him,\na circumstances would have added to his tenderness, had he ever left\nme room to believe it could receive an addition, when the mortal, the\nunexpected blow of separation fell upon us. I shall gallop post-over\nthe particulars, which I shudder yet to think of, and cannot; to this\ninstant, reconcile myself how, or by what means I could out-live it.\n\nTwo live-long days had I lingered through without hearing from him, I\nwho breathed, who existed but in him, and had never yet seen twenty-four\nhours pass without seeing or hearing from him. The third day my\nimpatience was so strong, my alarms had been so severe, that I perfectly\nsickened with them; and being unable to support the shock longer, I sunk\nupon the bed, and ringing for Mrs. Jones, who had far from comforted\nme under my anxieties, she came up, and I had scarce breath and spirit\nenough to find words to beg of her, if she would save my life, to fall\nupon some means of finding out, instantly, what was become of its\nonly prop and comfort. She pitied me in a way that rather sharpened my\naffliction than suspended it, and went out upon this commission.\n\nFor she had but to go to Charles's house, who lived but an easy\ndistance, in one of the streets that run into Covent Garden. There she\nwent into a public house, and from thence sent for a mid servant, whose\nname I had given her, as the properest to inform her.\n\nThe maid readily came, and as readily, when Mrs. Jones enquired of her\nwhat had become of Mr. Charles, or whether he was gone out of town,\nacquainted her with the disposal of her master's son, which, the very\nday after, was no secret to the servants. Such sure measures had he\ntaken, for the most cruel punishment of his child for having more\ninterest with his grandmother than he had, though he made use of a\npretence, plausible enough, to get rid of him in this secret abrupt\nmanner, for fear her fondness should have interposed a bar to his\nleaving England, and proceeding on a voyage he had concerted for him;\nwhich pretext was, that it was indispensably necessary to secure a\nconsiderable inheritance that devolved to him by the death of a rich\nmerchant (his own brother) at one of the factories in the South Seas, of\nwhich he had lately received advice, together with a copy of the will.\n\nIn consequence of which resolution, to send away his son, he had,\nunknown to him, made the necessary preparations for fitting him out,\nstruck a bargain with the captain of a ship, whose punctual execution of\nhis orders he had secured, by his interest with his principal owners\nand patron; and, in short, concerted his measures so secretly, and\neffectually, that whilst the son thought he was going down to the\nriver, that would take him a few hours, he was stopt on board of a ship,\ndebarred from writing, and more strictly watched than a State criminal.\n\nThus was the idol of my soul torn from me, and forced on a long voyage,\nwithout taking leave of one friend, or receiving one line of comfort,\nexcept a dry explanation and instructions, from his father, how to\nproceed when he should arrive at his destined port, enclosing, withal,\nsome letters of recommendation to a factor there: all these particulars\nI did not learn minutely till some time after.\n\nThe maid, at the same time, added, that she was sure this usage of her\nsweet young master would be the death of his grand-mamma, as indeed it\nproved true; for the old lady, on hearing it, did not survive the news\na whole month, and as her fortune consisted in an annuity, out of which\nshe had laid up no reserves, she left nothing worth mentioning to her so\nfatally envied darling, but absolutely refused to see his father before\nshe died.\n\nWhen Mrs. Jones returned, and I observed her looks, they seemed so\nunconcerned, and even nearest to pleased, that I half flattered myself\nshe was going to set my tortured heart at ease, by bringing me good\nnews; but this, indeed, was a cruel delusion of hope: the barbarian,\nwith all the coolness imaginable, stabs me to the heart, in telling\nme, succinctly, that he was sent away, at least, on a four years' voyage\n(here she stretched maliciously), and that I could not expect,\nin reason, ever to see him again: and all this with such pregnant\ncircumstances, that I could not escape giving them credit, as they were,\nindeed, too true!\n\nShe had hardly finished her report before I fainted away, and after\nseveral successive fits, all the while wild and senseless, I miscarried\nof the dear pledge of my Charles's love; but the wretched never die when\nit is fittest they should die, and women are hard-lived! to a proverb.\n\nThe cruel and interested care taken to recover me, saved an odious life:\nwhich, instead of the happiness and joys it had overflower in, all of\na sudden presented no view before me of any thing but the depth of\nmisery, horror, and the sharpest affliction.\n\nThus I lay six weeks, in the struggles of youth and constitution,\nagainst the friendly efforts of death, which I constantly invoked to\nmy relief and deliverance, but which proved too weak for my wish. I\nrecovered at length, but into a state of stupefaction and despair, that\nthreatened me with the loss of my senses, and a mad house.\n\nTime, however, that great comforter in ordinary, began to assuage the\nviolence of my suffering, and to-numb my feeling of them. My health\nreturned to me, though I still retained an air of grief, dejection, and\nlanguor, which taking off from the ruddiness of my country complexion,\nrendered it rather more delicate and affecting.\n\nThe landlady had all this while officiously provided, and seen that I\nwanted for nothing: and as soon as she saw me retrieved into a condition\nof answering her purpose, one day, after we had dined together, she\ncongratulated me on my recovery, the merit of which she took entirely\nto herself, and all this by way of introduction to a most terrible, and\nscurvy epilogue: \"You are now,\" says she, \"Miss Fanny, tolerably well,\nand you are very welcome to stay in these lodgings as; long as you\nplease! you see I have asked you for nothing this long time, but truly\nI have a call to make up a sum of money, which must be answered.\"\nAnd, with that, presents me with a bill of arrears for rent, diet,\napothecaries' charges, nurse, etc., sum total twenty-three pounds,\nseventeen and six-pence: towards discharging of which I had not in the\nworld (which she well knew) more than seven guineas, left by chance, of\nmy dear Charles's common stock, with me. At the same time, she desired\nme to tell her what course I would take for payment. I burst out into\na flood of tears, and told her my condition: that I would sell what\nfew clothes I had, and that, for the rest, would pay her as soon as\npossible. But my distress, being favourable to her view, only stiffened\nher the more.\n\nShe told me, very cooly, that \"she was indeed sorry for my misfortunes,\nbut that she must do herself justice, though it would go to the very\nheart of her to send such a tender young creature to prison....\" At the\nword \"prison!\" every drop of my blood chilled, and my fright acted so\nstrongly upon me, that, turning as pale and faint as a criminal at the\nfirst sight of his place of execution, I was on the point of swooning.\nMy landlady, who wanted only to terrify me to a certain point, and not\nto throw me into a state of body inconsistent with her designs upon it,\nbegan to sooth me again, and told me, in a tone composed to more pity\nand gentleness, that \"it would be my own fault, if she was forced to\nproceed to such extremities; but she believed there was a friend to be\nfound in the world, who would make up matters to both our satisfactions,\nand that she would bring him to drink tea with us that very afternoon,\nwhen she hoped we would come to a right understanding in our affairs.\"\nTo all this, not a word of answer; I sat mute, confounded, terrified.\n\nMrs. Jones, however, judging rightly that it was time to strike while\nthe impressions were so strong upon me, left me to myself and to all\nthe terrors of an imagination, wounded to death by the idea of going to\nprison, and, from a principle of self-preservation, snatching at every\nglimpse of redemption from it.\n\nIn this situation I sat near half an hour, swallowed up in grief and\ndespair, when my landlady came in, and observing a death-like dejection\nin my countenance, still in pursuance of her plan, put on a false pity,\nand bidding me be of good heart: \"Things,\" she said, \"would be but\nmy own friend\"; and closed with telling me \"she had brought a very\nhonourable gentleman to drink tea with me, who would give me the best\nadvice how to get rid of all my troubles.\" Upon which, without waiting\nfor a reply, she goes out, and returns with this very honourable\ngentleman, whose very honourable procuress she had been, on this, as\nwell as other occasions.\n\nThe gentleman, on his entering the room, made me a very civil bow, which\nI had scarce strength, or presence of mind enough to return a curtsey\nto; when the landlady, taking upon her to do all the honours of the\nfirst interview (for I had never, that I remember, seen the gentleman\nbefore), sets a chair for him, another for herself. All this while not a\nword on either side; a stupid stare was all the face I could put on this\nstrange visit.\n\nThe tea was made, and the landlady, unwilling, I suppose, to lose any\ntime, observing my silence and shyness before this entire stranger:\n\"Come, Miss Fanny,\" says she, in a coarse familiar style, and tone of\nauthority, \"hold up your head, child, and do not let sorrow spoil that\npretty face of yours. What! sorrows are only for a time; come, be free,\nhere is a worthy gentleman who has heard of your misfortunes, and is\nwilling to serve you; you must be better acquainted with him, do not you\nnow stand upon your punctilios, and this and that, but make your market\nwhile you may.\"\n\nAt this so delicate, and eloquent harangue, the gentleman, who saw I\nloooked frighted and amazed, and, indeed, incapable of answering, took\nher up for breaking things in so abrupt a manner, as rather to shock\nthan incline me to an acceptance of the good he intended me then,\naddressing himself to me, told me \"he was perfectly acquainted with my\nwhole story, and every circumstance of my distress which he owned was a\ncruel plunge for one of my youth and beauty to fall into.... that he had\nlong taken a liking to my person, for which he appealed to Mrs. Jones,\nthere present; but finding me so deeply engaged to another, he had lost\nall hopes of succeeding, till he had heard the sudden reverse of fortune\nthat had happened to me, on which he had given particular orders to my\nlandlady to see that I should want for nothing; and that, had he not\nbeen forced abroad to the Hague, on affairs he could not refuse himself\nto, he would himself have attended me during my sickness;... that on\nhis return, which was the day before, he had, on learning my recovery,\ndesired my landlady's good offices to introduce him to me, and was\nas angry, at least, as I was shocked, at the manner in which she had\nconducted herself towards obtaining him that happiness; but, that to\nshow me how much he disdained her procedure, and how far he was from\ntaking any ungenerous advantage of my situation, and from exacting\nany security for my gratitude, he would before my face, that instant,\ndischarge my debt entirely to my landlady, and give me her receipt in\nfull; after which I should be at liberty either to reject or grant his\nsuit, as he was much above putting any force upon my inclinations.\"\n\nWhilst he was exposing his sentiments to me, I ventured just to look up\nto him, and observed his figure, which was that of a very well-looking\ngentleman, well made, of about forty, dressed in a suit of plain\nclothes, with a large diamond ring on one of his fingers, the lustre of\nwhich played in my eyes as he waved his hand in talking, and raised my\nnotions of his importance. In short, he might pass for what is commonly\ncalled a comely black man, with an air of distinction natural to his\nbirth and condition.\n\nTo all his speeches, however, I answered only in tears that flower\nplentifully to my relief, and choking up my voice, excused me from\nspeaking, very luckily, for I should not have known what to say.\n\nThe sight, however, moved him, as he afterwards told me, irresistibly,\nand by way of giving me some reason to be less powerfully afflicted, he\ndrew out his purse, and calling for pen and ink, which the landlady was\nprepared for, paid her every farthing of her demand, independent of a\nliberal gratification which was to follow unknown to me, and taking a\nreceipt in full, very tenderly forced me to secure it, by guiding my\nhand, which he had thrust it into, so as to make me passively put it\ninto my pocket.\n\nStill I continued in a state of stupidity, or melancholic despair, as\nmy spirits could not yet recover from the violent shocks that they had\nreceived; and the accommodating landlady had actually left the room, and\nme alone with this strange gentleman, before I had observed it, and then\nI observed it without alarm, for I was now lifeless, and indifferent to\nevery thing.\n\nThe gentleman, however, no novice in affairs of this sort, drew near me;\nand, under the pretence of comforting me, first with his handkerchief\ndried my tears as they ran down my cheeks: presently he ventured to kiss\nme on my part, neither resistance nor compliance. I sat stock still; and\nnow looking on myself as bought by the payment that had been transacted\nbefore me.\n\nI did not care what became of my wretched body: and wanting life,\nspirits, or courage to oppose the least struggle, even that of the\nmodesty of my sex, I suffered, tamely, whatever the gentleman pleased;\nwho proceeding insensibly from freedom to freedom, insinuating his hand\nbetween my handkerchief and bosom, which he handled at discretion:\nfinding thus no repulse, and that every thing favoured, beyond\nexpectation, the completion of his desires, he took me in his arms, and\nbore me, without life or motion, to the bed, on which laying me gently\ndowned, and having me at what advantage he pleased, I did not so much\nas know what he was about, till recovering from a trance of lifeless\ninsensibility, I found him buried in me, whilst I lay passive and\ninnocent of the least sensations of pleasure: a death-cold corpse could\nscarce have less life or sense in it. As soon as he had thus pacified\na passion which had too little respected the condition I was in, he got\noff, and after recomposing the disorder of my clothes, employed himself\nwith the utmost tenderness to calm the transports of remorse and madness\nat myself, with which I was seized, too late, I confess, for having\nsuffered on that bed, the embraces of an utter stranger I tore my hair,\nwrung my hands, and beat my breast like a mad woman. But when my new\nmaster, for in that light I then viewed him, applied himself to appease\nme, as my whole rage was levelled at myself, no part of which I thought\nmyself permitted to aim at him, I begged of him with more submission\nthan anger, to leave me alone, that I might, at least, enjoy my\naffliction in quiet. This he positively refused, for fear, as he\npretended, I should do myself a mischief. Violent passions seldom last\nlong, and those of women least of any. A dead still calm succeeded this\nstorm, which ended in a profuse shower of tears.\n\nHad any one, but a few instants before, told me that I should have ever\nknown any man but Charles, I would have spit in his face or had I been\noffered infinitely a greater sum of money than that I saw paid for me,\nI had spurned the proposal in cold blood. But our virtues and our vices\ndepend too much on our circumstances; unexpectedly beset as I was,\nbetrayed by a mind weakened by a long severe affliction, and stunned\nwith the terrors of a goal, my defeat will appear the more excusable,\nsince I certainly was not present at, or a party in any sense to it.\nHowever, as the first enjoyment is decisive, and he was now over the\nbar, I thought I had no longer a right to refuse the caresses of one\nthat had got that advantage over me, no matter how obtained; conforming\nmyself then to this maxim, I considered myself as so much in his power,\nthat I endured his kisses and embraces without affecting struggles or\nanger; not that he, as yet, gave me any pleasure, or prevailed over the\naversion of my soul, to give myself up to any sensation of that sort;\nwhat I suffered, I suffered out of a kind of gratitude, and as a matter\nof course what had passed.\n\nHe was, however, so regardful as not to attempt the renewal of those\nextremities which had thrown me, just before, into such violent\nagitations; but, now secure of possession, contented himself with\nbringing me to temper by degrees, and waiting at the hand of time\nfor those fruits of generosity and courtship, which he since often\nreproached himself with having gathered much too green, when, yielding\nto the inability to resist him, and overborne by desires, he had wreaked\nhis passion on a mere lifeless, spiritless body, dead to all purpose of\njoy, since taking none, it ought to be supposed incapable of giving any.\nThis is, however, certain; my heart never thoroughly forgave him the\nmanner in which I had fallen to him, although, in point of interest,\nI had fallen to him, I had reason to be pleased that he found, in my\nperson, wherewithal to keep him from leaving me as easily as he had had\nme.\n\nThe evening was, in the mean time, so far advanced, that the maid came\nin to lay the cloth for supper, when I understood, with joy, that my\nlandlady, whose sight was present poison to me, was not to be with us.\n\nPresently a neat and elegant supper was introduced, and a bottle of\nBurgundy, with the other necessaries, were set on a dumb-waiter.\n\nThe maid quitting the room, the gentleman insisted, with a tender\nwarmth, that I should sit up in the elbow chair by the fire, and see him\neat, if I could not be prevailed on to eat myself. I obeyed with a heart\nfull or affliction, at the comparison it made between those delicious\ntete-a-tetes with my very dear youth, and this forced situation, this\nnew awkward scene, imposed and obtruded on me a cruel necessity.\n\nAt supper, after a great many arguments used to comfort and reconcile\nme to my fate, he told me that his name was H..., brother to the Earl\nof L.... and that having, by the suggestions of my landlady, been led\nto see me, he had found me perfectly to his taste, and given her\na commission to procure me at any rate, and that at length he had\nsucceeded, as much to his satisfaction as he passionately wished it\nmight be to mine adding, withal, some flattering assurances, that I\nshould have no cause to repent my knowledge of him.\n\nI had now got down at least half a partridge, and three or four glasses\nof wine, which he compelled me to drink by way of restoring nature, but\nwhether there was any thing extraordinary put into the wine, or whether\nthere wanted no more to revive the natural warmth of my constitution,\nand give fire to the old train, I began no longer to look with that\nconstraint, not to say disguise, on Mr. H...., which I had hitherto\ndone but, withal, there was not the least grain of love mixed with this\nsoftening of my sentiments: any other man would have been just the same\nto me as Mr. H..., that stood in the same circumstances, and had done\nfor me, and with me, what he had done.\n\nThere are not, on earth at least, eternal griefs; mine were, if not at\nan end, at least suspended: my heart, which had been so long overloaded\nwith anguish and vexation, began to dilate and open to the last gleam\nof diversion or amusement. I wept a little, and my tears relieved me; I\nsighed, and my sighs seemed to lighten me of a load that oppressed me;\nmy countenance grew, if not cheerful, at least more composed and free.\n\nMr. H..., who had watched, perhaps brought on this change, knew too well\nnot to seize it: he thrust the table imperceptibly from between us, and\nbringing his chair to face me, he soon began, after preparing me by all\nthe endearments of assurance and protestations, to lay hold of my hands,\nto kiss me, and once more to make free with my bosom, which, being at\nfull liberty from the disorder of a loose dishabile, now panted and\nthrobbed, less with indignation than with fear and bashfulness, at being\nused so familiarly by still a stranger. But he soon gave me greater\noccasion to exclaim, by stooping down and slipping his hands above my\ngarters; thence he strove to regain the pass, which he had before found\nso open, and unguarded; but now he could not unlock the twist of my\nthighs; I gently complained, and begged him to let me alone; told him\nI was not well. However, he saw there was more form and ceremony in my\nresistance, than good earnest; he made his conditions for desisting from\npursuing his point, that I should be put instantly to bed, whilst he\ngave certain orders to the landlady, and that he would return in an\nhour, when he hoped to find me more reconciled to his passion for me,\nthan I seemed at present. I neither assented nor denied, but my air and\nmanner of receiving his proposal, gave him to see that I did not think\nmyself enough my own mistress to refuse it.\n\nAccordingly he went out and left me, when a minute or two after, before\nI could recover myself into any composure for thinking, the maid came\nin with her mistress's service, and a small silver orringer of what she\ncalled a bridal posset, and desired me to eat it as I went to bed,\nwhich consequently I did, and felt immediately a heat, a fire run like a\nhue-and-cry through every part of my body; I burnt, I glowed, and wanted\neven little of wishing for any man.\n\nThe maid, as soon as I was lain down, took the candle away, and wishing\nme a good night, went out of the room, and shut the door after her.\n\nShe had hardly time to get down stairs, before Mr. H.... opened my room\ndoor softly, and came in, now undressed, in his night-gown and cap,\nwith two lighted wax candles, and bolting the door, gave me, though I\nexpected him, some sort of alarm. He came a tip-toe to the bed side, and\nsaying with a gentle whisper: \"Pray, my dear, do not be startled... I\nwill be very tender and kind to you.\" He then hurried off his clothes,\nand leaped into bed, having given me openings enough, whilst he was\nstripping, to observe his brawny structure, strong made limbs, and rough\nshaggy breast.\n\nThe bed shook again when it received this new load. He lay on\nthe outside, where he kept the candles burning, no doubt for the\nsatisfaction of every sense, for as soon as he had kissed me, he rolled\ndown the bed clothes, and seemed transported with the view of all my\nperson at full length, which he covered with a profusion of kisses,\nsparing no part of me. Then, being on his knees between my thighs, he\ndrew up his shirt, and bared all his hairy thighs, and stiff staring\ntruncheon, red top, and rooted into a thicket of curls, which covered\nhis belly to the novel, and gave it the air of a flesh brush; and soon\nI feel it joining close to mine, when he had drove the nail up to the\nhead, and left no partition but the intermediate hair on both sides.\n\nI had it now, I felt it now, and, beginning to drive, he soon gave\nnature such a powerful summons down to her favourite quarters, that she\ncould no longer refuse repairing thither; all my animals spirits then\nrushed mechanically to that center of attraction, and presently, inly\nwarmed, and stirred as I was beyond bearing, I lost all restraint, and\nyielding to the force of the emotion, gave down, as mere woman, those\neffusions of pleasure, which, in the strictness of still faithful love,\nI could have wished to have kept in.\n\nYet oh! what an immense difference did I feel between this impression of\na pleasure merely animal, and struck out of the collision of the sexes,\nby a passive bodily effect, from that sweet fury, that rage of active\ndelight which crowns the enjoyments of a mutual love passion, where two\nhearts, tenderly and truly united, club to exalt the joy, and give it\na spirit and soul that bids defiance to that end which mere momentary\ndesires generally terminate in, when they die of a surfeit of\nsatisfaction!\n\nMr. H..., whom no distinctions of that sort seemed to distract, scarce\ngave himself or me breathing time from the last encounter, but, as if he\nhad tasked himself to prove that the appearances of his vigour were\nno signs hung out in vain, in a few minutes he was in a condition for\nrenewing the onset; to which, preluding with a storm of kisses, he drove\nthe same course as before, with unbated fervour; and thus, in repeated\nengagements, kept me constantly in exercise, till dawn of morning, in\nall which time he made me fully sensible of the virtues of his firm\ntexture of limbs, his square shoulders, broad chest, compact hard\nmuscles, in short a system of manliness, that might pass for no bad\nimage of our ancient sturdy barons, whose race is now so thoroughly\nrefined and frittered away into the more delicate and modern built frame\nof our pap-nerved softlings, who are as pale, as pretty, and almost as\nmasculine as their sisters.\n\nMr. H..., content, however, with having the day break upon his triumph,\nresigned me up to the refreshment of a rest we both wanted, and we soon\ndropped into a profound sleep.\n\nThough he was some time awake before me, yet he did not offer to disturb\na repose he had given me so much occasion for; but on my first stirring,\nwhich was not till past ten o'clock, I was obliged to endure one more\ntrial of his manhood.\n\nAbout eleven, in came Mrs. Jones, with two basins of the richest soup,\nwhich her experience in these matters had moved her to prepare. I pass\nover the fulsome compliments, the cant of the decent procuress, with\nwhich she saluted us both; but though my blood rose at the sight of her,\nI supprest my emotions, and gave all my concerne to reflections on what\nwould be the consequence of this new engagement.\n\nBut Mr. H..., who penetrated my uneasiness, did not suffer me to\nlanguish under it, and acquainted me, that having taken a solid sincere\naffection to me, he would begin by giving me one leading mark of it, in\nremoving me out of a house which must, for many reasons, be irksome and\ndisagreeable to me, into convenient lodgings, where he would take all\nimaginable care of me; and desiring not to have any explanations with\nmy landlady, or be impatient till he returned, he dressed and went out,\nhaving left me a purse with two and twenty guineas in it, being all\nhe had about him, as he express it, to keep my pocket still further\nsupplied.\n\nAs soon as he was gone, I felt the usual consequence of the first launch\ninto vice (for my love attachment to Charles never appeared to me in\nthat light). I was instantly borne away down the stream without making\nback to the shore. My dreadful necessities, my gratitude, and above all,\nto say the plain truth, the dissipation and diversion I began to find\nin this new acquaintance, from the black corroding thoughts my heart had\nbeen a prey to, ever since the absence of my dear Charles, concurred to\nstun all my contrary reflections. If I now thought of my first, my only\ncharmer, it was still with the tenderness and regret of the fondest\nlove, embittered with the consciousness that I was no longer worthy\nof him. I could have begged my bread with him all over the world, but\nwretch that I was! I had neither the virtue or courage requisite not to\noutlive my separation from him.\n\nYet, had not my heart been thus preengaged, Mr. H... might probably have\nbeen the sole master of it; but the place was full, and the force of\nconjectures alone had made him the possessor of my person; the charms\nof which had, by the bye, been his sole object and passion, and were, of\ncourse, no foundation for a love either very delicate or very durable.\n\nHe did not return till six in the evening', to take me away to my\nnew lodgings; and my moveables being soon packed, and conveyed into\na hackney coach, it cost me but little regret to take my leave of a\nlandlady whom I thought I had so much reason not to be over pleased\nwith; and as for her part, she made no other difference to my staying or\ngoing, but what that of the profit created.\n\nWe soon got to the house appointed for me, which was that of a plain\ntradesman, who, on the score of interest, was entirely at Mr. H...'s\ndevotion, and who let him the first floor, very genteelly furnished,\nfor two guineas a week, of which I was instated mistress, with a maid to\nattend me.\n\nHe stayed with me that evening, and we had a supper from a neighbouring\ntavern, after which, and a gay glass or two, the maid put me to bed. Mr.\nH.... soon followed, and notwithstanding the fatigues of the preceding\nnight, I found no quarter nor remission from him: he piquet himself, as\nhe told me, on doing the honours of my new apartment.\n\nThe morning being pretty well advanced, we got to breakfast; and the ice\nnow broke, my heart, no longer engrossed by love, began to take ease,\nand to please itself with such trifles Mr. H....'s liberal liking led\nhim to make his court to the usual vanity of our sex. Silks, laces:\near rings, pearl necklace, gold watch, in sort, all the trinkets and\narticles of dress were lavishly heaped upon me; the sence of which, if\nit did not create returns of love, forced a kind of grateful fondness,\nsomething like love: a distinction which it would be spoiling the\npleasure of nine tenths of the keepers in the town to make, and is, I\nsuppose, the very good reason why so few of them ever do make it.\n\nI was now established the kept mistress in form, well lodged, with a\nvery sufficient allowance, and lighted up with all the lustre of dress.\n\nMr. H.... continued kind and tender to me; yet, with all this, I was\nfar from happy: for, besides my regrets for my dear youth, which,\nthough often suspended or diverted, still returned upon me in certain\nmelancholic moments with redoubled violence, I wanted more society,\nmore dissipation.\n\nAs to Mr. H.... he was so much my superior in every sense, that I felt\nit too much to the disadvantage of the gratitude I owed him. Thus he\ngained my esteem, though he could not raise my taste; I was qualified\nfor no sort of conversation with him, except one sort, and that is a\nsatisfaction which leaves tiresome intervals, if not filled up by love,\nor other amusements.\n\nMr. H...., so experienced, so learned in the ways of women, numbers\nof whom had passed through his hands, doubtless, soon perceived this\nuneasiness, and, without approving, or liking me the better for it, had\nthe complaisance to indulge me.\n\nHe made suppers at my lodging, where he brought several companions of\nhis pleasures, with their mistresses; and by this means I got into a\ncircle of acquaintance, that soon stripped me of all the remains of\nbashfulness and modesty which might be yet left of my country education,\nand were, to a just taste, perhaps, the greatest of my charms.\n\nWe visited one another in form, and mimicked, as near as we could, all\nthe miseries, the follies, and impertinencies of the women in quality,\nin the round of which they trifle away their time, without it ever\nentering their little heads, that on earth there cannot subsist any\nthing more silly, more flat, more insipid and worthless, than, generally\nconsidered, their system of life is: they ought to treat the men as\ntheir tyrants, indeed! were they to condemn them to it.\n\nBut though, amongst the kept mistresses (and I was now acquainted with\na good many, besides some useful matrons, who live by their connexions\nwith them), I hardly knew one that did not perfectly detest their\nkeepers, and, of course, made little or no scruple of any infidelity\nthey could safely accomplish, I had still no notion of wronging mine:\nfor, besides that no mark of jealousy on his side started me the hint,\nor gave me the provocation to play him a trick of that sort, and that\nhis constant generosity, politeness, and tender attention to please me,\nforced a regard to him, that, without affecting my heart, insured him my\nfidelity, no object had yet presented that could overcome the habitual\nliking I had contracted for him and I was on the eve of obtaining, from\nthe movements of his own voluntary generosity, a modest provision for\nlife, when an accident happened which broke all the measures he had\nresolved upon in my favour.\n\nI had now lived near seven months with Mr. H.... when one day returning\nto my lodgings, from a visit in the neighbourhood, where I used to stay\nlonger, I found the street door open, and the maid of the house standing\nat it, talking with some of her acquaintance, so that I came in without\nknocking and, as I passed by, she told me Mr. H.... was above. I slept\nup stairs into my own bed-chamber, with no other thought than of pulling\noff my hat etc., and then to wait upon him in the dining room, into\nwhich my bed-chamber had a door, as is common enough. Whilst I was\nuntying my hat strings, I fancied I heard my maid Hannah's voice and a\nsort of tustle, which raised my curiosity; I stole softly to the door,\nwhere a knot in the wood had been slipped out, and afforded a very\ncommanding peep-hole to the scene then in agitation, the actors of which\nhad been to earnestly employed to hear my opening my own door, from the\nlanding place of the stairs, into my bedchamber.\n\nThe first sight that struck me was Mr. H.... pulling and hauling this\ncoarse country strammel towards a couch that stood in a corner of the\ndining-room; to which the girl made only a sort of awkward holdening\nresistance, crying out so loud, that I, who listened at the door, could\nscarce hear her: \"Pray Sir, don't.., let me alone... I am not for your\nturn... You cannot, sure, demean yourself with such a poor body as I...\nLord! Sir, my mistress may come home... I must not indeed... I will\ncry out...\" All of which did not hinder her from insensibly suffering\nherself to be brought to the foot of the couch, upon which a push of no\nmighty violence served to give her a very easy fall, and my gentleman\nhaving got up his hands to the strong hold of her Virtue, she, no\ndoubt, thought it was time to give up the argument, and that all further\ndefense would be vain: and he, throwing her petticoats over her face,\nwhich was now as red as scarlet, discovered a pair of stout, plump,\nsubstantial thighs, and tolerably white; he mounted them round his haps,\nand coming out with his drawn weapon, stuck it in the cloven sport,\nwhere he seemed to find a less difficult entrance than perhaps he had\nflattered himself with (for, by the way, this blouse had left her place\nin the country, for a bastard), and, indeed, all his motions shewed he\nwas lodged pretty much at large. After he had done, his Deare gets up,\ndrops her petticoats down, and smooths her apron and handkerchief. Mr.\nH.... looked a little silly, and taking out some money, gave it her,\nwith an air indifferent enough, bidding her be a good girl, and say\nnothing.\n\nHad I loved this man, it was not in nature for me to have had patience\nto see the whole scene through: I should have broke in and played the\njealous princess with a vengeance. But that was not the case: my pride\nalone was hurt, my heart not, and I could easier win upon myself to see\nhow far he would go, till I had no uncertainty upon my conscience.\n\nThe least delicate of all affairs of this sort being now over, I retired\nsoftly into my closet, where I began to consider what I should do. My\nfirst scheme naturally, was to rush in and upbraid them; this, indeed,\nflattered my present emotions and vexations, as it would have given\nimmediate vent to them; but, on second thoughts, not being so clear\nas to the consequence to be apprehended from such a step, I began my\ndiscovery still a safer season, when dissembly my discovery till a safer\nseason, when Mr. H.... should have perfected the settlement he had\nmade overtures to me of, and which I was not to think such a violent\nexplanation, as I was indeed not equal to the management of, could\npossibly forward, and might destroy. On the other hand, the provocation\nseemed too gross, too flagrant not to give me some thoughts of revenge;\nthe very start of which idea restored me to perfect composure; and\ndelighted as I was with the confused plan of it in my head, I was\neasily mistress enough of myself to support the part of ignorance I\nhad prescribed to myself; and as all this circle of reflections was\ninstantly over, I stole a tip-toe to the passage door, and opening it\nwith a noise, passed for having that moment come home; and after a short\npause, as if to pull off my things, I opened the door into the dining\nroom, where I fund the dowdy blowing the fire, and my faithful shepherd\nwalking about the room, and wistling, as cool and unconcerned as if\nnothing had happened. I think, however, he had not much to brag of\nhaving out-dissembled me: for I kept up, nobly, the character of our sex\nfor art, and went up to him with the same open air of frankness as I had\never received him. He stayed but a little while, made some excuse for\nnot being able to stay the evening with me, and went out.\n\nAs for the wench, she was now spoiled, at least for my servant; and\nscarce eight and forty hours were gone round, before her insolence, on\nwhat had passed betwen Mr. H.... and her, gave me so fair an occasion\nto turn her away, at a minute's warning, that, not to have done it would\nhave been the wonder; so that he could neither disapprove it nor find\nin it the least reason to suspect my original motive. What became of her\nafterwards, I know not; but generous as Mr. H.... was, he undoubtedly\nmade her amends: though, I dare answer, that he kept up no further\ncommerce with her of that sort; as his stooping to such a coarse morsel,\nwas only a sudden sally of lust, on seeing a wholesome looking, buxom\ncountry wench, and no more strange than hunger, or even a whimsical\nappetite's making a fling meal of neck-beef, for change of diet.\n\nHad I considered this escapade of Mr. H.... in no more than that light\nand contented myself with turning away the wench, I had thought and\nacted right; but, flushed as I was with imaginary wrongs, I should have\nheld Mr. H... to have been cheaply off, if I had not pushed my revenge\nfarther, and repaid him, as exactly as could for the soul of me, in the\nsame coin.\n\nNor was this worthy act of justice long delayed: I had it too much at\nheart. Mr. H... had, about a fortnight before, taken into his service\na tenant's son, just come out the country, a very handsome young lad,\nscarce turned of nineteen, fresh as a rose, well sharped and clear\nlimbed: in short, a very good excuse for any woman's liking, even\nthough revenge had been out of the question; any woman, I say, who\nwas disprejudiced, and that wit and spirit enough to prefer a point of\npleasure to a point of pride.\n\nMr. H... had clapped a livery upon him; and his chief employ was, after\nbeing shewn my lodgings, to bring and carry letters or messages between\nhis master and me; and as the situation of all kept ladies is not\nthe fittest to inspire respect, even to the meanest of mankind, and,\nperhaps, less of it from the most ignorant, I could not help observing\nthat this lad, who was, I suppose, acquainted with my relation to his\nmaster by his fellow servants, used to eye me in that bashful confused\nway, more expressive, more moving and readier caught at by our sex, than\nany other declarations whatever: my figure had, it seems, struck him,\nand modest and innocent as he was, he did not himself know that the\npleasure he took in looking at me was love, or desire; but his eyes,\nnaturally wanton, and now inflamed with passion, spoke a great deal more\nthan he durst have imagined they did. Hitherto, indeed, I had only taken\nnotice of the comeliness of the youth, but without the least design: my\npride alone would have guarded me from a thought that way, had not\nMr. H....'s condescension with my maid, where there was not half the\ntemptation, in point of person, set me a dangerous example; but now I\nbegan to look on this stripling as every way a delicious instrument\nof my designed retaliation upon Mr. H.... of an obligation for which I\nshould have made a conscience to die in his debt.\n\nIn order then to pave the way for the accomplishment of my scheme, for\ntwo or three times that the young fellow came to me with messages, I\nmanaged so, or without affectation to have him admitted to my bed side,\nor brought to me at my toilet, where I was dressing; and by carelessly\nshewing or letting him, as if without meaning or design, sometimes my\nbosom rather more bare than it should be; sometimes my hair, of which I\nhad a very fine head, in the natural flow of it while combing; sometimes\na neat leg, that had unfortunately slipt its garter, which I made no\nscruple of tying before him, easily gave him the impressions favourable\nto my purpose, which I could perceive to sparkle in his eyes, and glow\nin his cheeks: then certain slight squeezes by the hand, as I took\nletters from him, did his business completely.\n\nWhen I saw him thus moved, and fired for my purpose, I inflamed him\nyet more, by asking him several leading questions, such as: \"Had he a\nmistress?... was she prettier than me?... could he love such a one as I\nwas?...\" and the like; to all which the blushing simpleton answered to\nmy wish, in a strain of perfect nature, perfect undebauched innocence,\nbut with all the awkwardness and simplicity of country breeding.\n\nWhen I thought I had sufficiently ripened him for the laudable point I\nhad in view, one day that I expected him at a particular hour, I took\ncare to have the coast clear for the reception I designed him; and, as\nI laid it, he came to the dining room door, tapped at it, and, in my\nbidding him come in; he did so, and shut the door after him. I desired\nhim, then, to bolt it on the inside, pretending it would not otherwise\nkeep shut.\n\nI was then lying at length upon that very couch, the scene of Mr.\nH....'s polite joys, in an undress, which was with all the art of\nnegligence flowing loose, and in a most tempting disorder: no stays,\nno hoop..., no incumbrance whatever. On the other hand, he stood at a\nlittle distance, that gave me a full view of a fine featured, shapely,\nhealthy country lad, breathing the sweets of fresh blooming youth;\nhis hair, which was of a perfect shining black, played to his face in\nnatural side curls, and was set out with a smart tuck-up behind; new\nbuckskin breechs, that, clipping close, shewed the shape of a plump,\nwell made thigh; white stockings, garter-laced livery, shoulder knot,\naltogether composed a figure of pure flesh and blood, and appeared\nunder no disgrace from the lowness of a dress, to which a certain spruce\nneatness seems peculiarly fitted.\n\nI bid him come towards me, and give me his letter, at the same time\nthrowing down, carelessly, a book I had in my hands. He coloured,\nand came within reach of delivering me the letter, which he held out,\nawkwardly enough, for me to take, with his eyes rivetted on my\nbosom, which was, through the designed disorder of my handkerchief,\nsufficiently bare, and rather than hid.\n\nI, smiling in his face, took the letter, and immediately catching\nhold of his shirt sleeve, drew him towards me, blushing, and almost\ntrembling; for surely his extreme bashfulness, and utter inexperience\ncalled for, at least, all the advances to encourage him: his body\nwas now conveniently inclined toward me, and just softly chucking his\nbeardless chin, I asked him: \"If he was afraid of a lady?...\" and with\nthat took, and carrying his hands to my breasts, I press it tenderly\nto them. They were now finely furnished, and raised in flesh, so that,\npanting with desire, they rose and fell, in quick heaves, under his\ntouch: at this, the boy's eyes began to lighten with all the fires of\ninflamed nature, and his cheeks flushed with a deep scarlet: tongue-tied\nwith joy, rapture, and bashfulness, he could not speak, but then his\nlooks, his emotion, sufficiently satisfied me that my train had taken,\nand that I had no disappointment to fear.\n\nMy lips, which I threw in his way, so that he could not escape kissing\nthem, fixed, fired, and emboldened him: and now, glancing my eyes\ntowards that part of his dress which covered the essential object of\nenjoyment, I plainly discovered the swell and commotion there; and as\nI was now too far advanced to stop in so fair a way, and was indeed no\nlonger able to contain myself, or wait the slower progress of his maiden\nbash-fulness (for such it seemed, and really was), I stole my hands upon\nhis thighs, down one of which I could both see and feel a stiff hard\nbody, confined by his breeches, that my fingers could discover no end\nto. Curious then, and eager to unfold so alarming a mystery, playing,\nas it were, with his buttons, which were bursting ripe from the active\nforce within, those of his waistband and fore-flap flew open at a touch,\nwhen out IT started; and now, disengaged from the shirt, I saw, with\nwonder and surprise, what? not the play thing of a boy, not the weapon\nof a man, but a Maypole, of so enormous a standard, that had proportions\nbeen observed, it must have belonged to a young giant. Yet I could not,\nwithout pleasure, behold, and even venture to feel, such a length, such\na breadth of animated ivory! perfectly well turned and fashioned, the\nproud stiffness of which distented its skin, whose smooth polish and\nvelvet softness might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex, and\nwhose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black\ncurling hair round the root: through the jetty springs of which the fair\nskin shewed as in a fine evening you may have remarked the clear light\nthrough the branchwork of distant trees over-topping the summit of a\nhill: then the broad of blueish-casted incarnate of the head, and\nblue serpentines of its veins, altogether composed the most striking\nassemblage of figure and colours in nature. In short, it stood an object\nof terror and delight.\n\nBut what was yet more surprising, the owner of this natural curiosity,\nthrough the want of occasions in the strictness of his home breeding,\nand the little time he had been in town not having afforded him one; was\nhitherto an absolute stranger, in practice at least, to the use of all\nthat manhood he was so nobly stocked with; and it now fell to my lot to\nstand his first trial of it, if I could resolve to run the risks of its\ndisproportion to that tender part of me, which such an oversized machine\nwas very fit to lay in ruins.\n\nBut it was now of the latest to deliberate, for, by this time, the young\nfellow, over heated with the present objects, and too high metled to be\nlonger curbed in by that modesty and awe which had hitherto restrained\nhim, ventured, under the stronger impulse, and instructive promptership\nof nature alone, to slip his hands, trembling with eager impetuous\ndesires, under my petticoats; and seeing, I suppose, nothing extremely\nsevere in my looks, to stop or dash him, he feels out, and seizes,\ngently, the center spot of his ardours. Oh then! the fiery touch of\nhis lingers determines me, and my fears melting away before the glowing\nintolerable heat, my thighs disclose of themselves, and yield all\nliberty to his hand: and now, a favourable movement giving my petticoats\na toss, the avenue lay too fair, too open to be missed. He is now upon\nme: I had placed myself with a jerk under him, as commodious and open as\npossible to his attempts, which were untoward enough, for his machine,\nmeeting with no inlet, bore and battered stiffly against me in random\npushes, now above, now below, now beside his point; till, burning with\nimpatience from its irritating touches, I guided gently, with my hand,\nthis furious fescue to where my young novice was now to be taught\nhis first lesson of pleasure. Thus he nicked, at length, the warm and\ninsufficient orifice; but he was made to find no breach impracticable,\nand mine, though so often entered, was still far from wide enough to\ntake him easily in.\n\nBy my direction, however, the head of his unwieldy machine was so\ncritically pointed, that, feeling him fore-right against the tender\nopening, a favourable motion from me met his timely thrust, by which\nthe lips of it, strenuously dilated, gave way to his thus assisted\nimpetuosity, so that we might both feel that he had gained a lodgment.\nPursuing then his point, he soon, by violent, and, to me, most painful\npiercing thrusts, wedges himself at length so far in, as to be now\ntolerably secure of his entrance: here he stuck, and I now felt such a\nmixture of pleasure and pain, as there is no giving a definition of. I\ndreaded alike his splitting me farther up, or his withdrawing; I could\nnot bear either to keep or part with him. The sense of pain, however,\nprevailing, from his prodigious size and stiffness, acting upon me\nin those continued rapid thrusts, with which he furiously pursued his\npenetration, made me cry out gently: \"Oh, my dear, you hurt me!\" This\nwas enough to check the tender respectful boy even in his mid-career;\nand he immediately drew out the sweet cause of my complaint, whilst his\neyes eloquently expressed, at once, his grief for hurting me, and\nhis reluctance at dislodging from quarters, of which the warmth and\ncloseness had given him a gust of pleasure, that he was now desire mad\nto satisfy, and yet too much a novice not to be afraid of my withholding\nhis relief, on account of the pain he had put me to.\n\nBut I was, myself, far from being pleased with his having too much\nregarded my tender exclaims; for now, more fired with the object before\nme, as it still stood with the fiercest erection, unbonneted,\nand displayed its broad vermilion head, I first gave the youth a\nre-encouraging kiss, which he repaid me with a fervour that seemed at\nonce to thank me, and bribe my further compliance; and soon replaced\nmyself in a posture to receive, at all risk, the renewed invasion, which\nhe did not delay an instant: for, being presently remounted, I once\nmore felt the smooth hard gristle forcing an entrance, which he achieved\nrather easier than before. Pained, however, as I was, with his efforts\nof gaining a complete admission, which he was so regardful as to manage\nby gentle degrees, I took care not to complain. In the mean time, the\nsoft strait passage gradually loosens, yields, and, stretched to its\nutmost bearing, by the stick, thick, indriven engine, sensible, at once,\nto the ravishing pleasure of the feel and the pain of the distension,\nlet him in about half way, when all the most nervous activity he now\nexerted, to further his penetration, gained him not an inch of his\npurpose: for, whilst he hesitated there, the crisis of pleasure overtook\nhim, and the close compressure of the warm surrounding flow drew from\nhim the ecstatic gush, even before mine was ready to meet it, kept up\nby the pain I had endured in the course of the engagement, from the\ninsufferable size of his weapon, though it was not as yet in above half\nits length.\n\nI expected then, but without wishing it, that he would draw, but was\npleasingly disappointed: for he was not to be let off so. The well\nbreathed youth, hot-mettled, and flush with genial juices, was now\nfairly in for making me know my driver. As soon, then, as he had made a\nshort pause, waking, as it were, out of the trance of pleasure (in which\nevery sense seemed lost for a while, whilst, with his eyes shut, and\nshort quick breathings, he had yielded down his maiden tribute), he\nstill kept his post, yet unsated with enjoyment, and solacing in these\nso new delights; till his stiffness, which had scarce perceptibly\nremitted, being thoroughly recovered to him, who had not once\nunsheathed, he proceeded afresh to cleave and open to himself an entire\nentry into me, which was not a little made easy to him by the balsamic\ninjection, with: which he had just plentifully moistened the whole\ninternals of the passage. Redoubling, then, the active energy of his\nthrusts, favoured by the fervid appetency of my motions, the soft oiled\nwards can no longer stand so effectual a picklock, but yield, and open\nhim an entrance. And now, with conspiring nature, and my industry,\nstrong to aid him, he pierces, penetrates, and at length, winning his\nway inch by inch, gets entirely in, and finally, a home made thrust\nsheaths it up to the guard; on the information of which, from the close\njointure of our bodies (insomuch that the hair on both sides perfectly\ninterweaved and incircled together), the eyes of the transported\nyouth sparkled with more joyous fires, and all his looks and motions\nacknowledged excess of pleasure, which I now began to share, for I felt\nhim in my very vitals! I was quite sick with delight! stirred beyond\nbearing with its furious agitations within me, and gorged and crammed,\neven to a surfeit. Thus I lay gasping, panting under him, till his\nbroken breathings, faultering accents, eyes twinkling with humid fires,\nlunges more furious, and an increased stiffness, gave me to hail\nthe approaches of the second period: it came... and the sweet youth,\noverpowered with the ecstasy, died away in my arms, melting a flood\nthat shot in genial warmth into the innermost recesses of my body; every\nconduit of which, dedicated to that pleasure, was on flow to mix with\nit. Thus we continued for some instants, lost, breathless, senseless of\nevery thing, and in every part but those favourite ones of nature,\nin which all that we enjoyed of life and sensation was now totally\nconcentered.\n\nWhen our mutual trance was a little over, and the young fellow had\nwithdrawn that delicious stretcher, with which he had most plentifully\ndrowned all thoughts of revenge, in the sense of actual pleasure, the\nwidened wounded passage refunded a stream of pearly liquids, which\nflowed down my thighs, mixed with streaks of blood, the marks of the\nravage of that monstrous machine of his, which had now triumphed over\na kind of second maidenhead. I stole, however, my handkerchief to those\nparts, and wiped them as dry as I could, whilst he was re-adjusting and\nbuttoning up.\n\nI made him sit down by me, and as he had gathered courage from such\nextreme intimacy, he gave me an aftercourse of pleasure, in a natural\nburst of tender gratitude and joy, at the new scenes of bliss I had\nopened to him: scenes positively new, as he had never before had the\nleast acquaintance with that mysterious mark, the cloven stamp of female\ndistinction, though nobody better qualified than he to penetrate into its\ndeepest recesses, or do it nobler justice. But when, by certain motions,\ncertain unquietness of his hands, that wandered not without design, I\nfound he languished for satisfying a curiosity, natural enough, to view\nand handle those parts which attract and concenter the warmest force\nof imagination, charmed, as I was, to have any occasion of obliging and\nhumouring his young desires, I suffered him to proceed as he pleased,\nwithout check or control, to the satisfaction of them.\n\nEasily, then, reading in my eyes the full permission of myself to\nall his wishes, he scarce pleased himself more than me; when, having\ninsinuated his hand under my petticoat and shift, he presently removed\nthose bars to the sight, by slily lifting them upwards, under favour\nof a thousand kisses, which he thought, perhaps, necessary to divert my\nattention from what he was about. All my drapery being now rolled up to\nmy waist, I threw myself into such a posture upon the couch, as gave up\nto him, in full view, the whole region of delight, and all the luxurious\nlandscape around it. The transported youth devoured every thing with\nhis eyes, and tried, with his fingers, to lay more open to his sight\nthe secrets of that dark and delicious deep: he opens the folding lips,\nthe softness of which, yielding entry to any thing of a hard body, close\nround it, and oppose the sight; and feeling further, meets with, and\nwonder at, a soft fleshy excrescence, which, limber and relaxed after\nthe late enjoyment, now grew, under the touch and examination of\nhis fiery fingers, more and more stiff and considerable, till the\ntitillating ardours of that so sensible part made me sigh, as if he had\nhurt me; on which he withdrew his curious probing fingers, asking me\npardon, as it were, in a kiss that rather increased the flame there.\n\nNovelty ever makes the strongest impressions, and in pleasures,\nespecially; no wonder then, that he was swallowed up in raptures of\nadmiration of things so interesting by their nature, and now seen and\nhandled for the first time. On my part, I was richly overpaid for the\npleasure I gave him, in that of examining the power of those objects\nthus abandoned to him, naked and free to his loosest wish, over the\nartless, natural stripling: his eyes streaming fire, his cheeks\nglowing with a florid red, his fervid frequent sighs, whilst his hands\nconvulsively squeezed, opened, pressed together again the lips and\nsides of that deep flesh wound, or gently twitched the over-growing\nmoss; and all proclaimed the excess, the riot of joys, in having his\nwantonness thus humoured. But he did not long abuse my patience, for the\nobjects before him had now put him by all his, and, coming out with\nthat formidable machine of his, he lets the fury loose, and pointing it\ndirectly to the pouting-lip mouth, that bid him sweet defiance in dumb\nshew, squeezes in his head, and, driving with refreshed rage, breaks in,\nand plugs up the whole passage of that soft pleasure-conduit pipe, where\nhe makes all shake again, and put, once more, all within me into such\nan uproar, as nothing could still, but a fresh inundation from the\nvery engine of those flames, as well as from all the springs with which\nnature floats that reservoir of joy, when risen to its floodmark.\n\nI was now so bruised, so battered, so spent with this overmatch, that\nI could hardly stir, or raise myself, but lay palpitating, till the\nferment of my senses subsiding by degrees, and the hour striking at\nwhich I was obliged to dispatch my young man, I tenderly advised him of\nthe necessity there was for parting; at which I felt so much displeasure\nas he could do, who seemed eagerly disposed to keep the field, and to\nenter on a fresh action. But the danger was too great, and after some\nhearty kisses of leave, and recommendations of secrecy and discretion,\nI forced myself to send him away, not without assurances of seeing him\nagain, to the same purpose, as soon as possible, and thrust a guinea\ninto his hands: not more, less, being too flush of money, a suspicion\nor discovery might arise from thence; having everything to fear from the\ndangerous indiscretion of that age in which young fellows would be too\nirresistible, too charming, if we had not that terrible fault to guard\nagainst.\n\nGiddy and intoxicated as I was with such satiating draughts of pleasure,\nI still lay on the couch, supinely stretched out, in a delicious languor\ndiffused over all my limbs, hugging myself for being thus revenged to\nmy heart's content, and that in a manner so precisely alike, and on\nthe identical spot in which I had received the supposed injury. No\nreflections on the consequences ever once perplexed me, nor did I make\nmyself one single reproach for having, by this step, completely entered\nmyself into a profession more decried than disused. I should have held\nit ingratitude to the pleasure I had received, to have repented of it;\nand since I was now over the bar, I thought, by plunging head and ears\ninto the stream I was hurried away by, to drown all sense of shame or\nreflection.\n\nWhilst I was thus making these laudable dispositions, and whispering\nto myself a kind of tacit vow of incontinency, enters Mr. H... The\nconsciousness of what I had been doing deepened yet the glowing of my\ncheeks, flushed with the warmth of the late action, which, joined to\nthe piquant air of my dishabile, drew from Mr. H.... a compliment on my\nlooks, which he was proceeding to bask the sincerity of with proofs, and\nthat with so brisk an action, as made me tremble for fear of a discovery\nfrom the condition those parts were left in from their late severe\nhandling: the orifice dilated and inflamed, the lips swollen with their\nuncommon distension, the ringlets pressed down, crushed and uncurled\nwith the over flowing moisture that had wet everything round it; in\nshort, the different feel and state of things would hardly have passed\nupon one of Mr. H.....'s nicety and experience unaccounted for but by\nthe real cause. But here the woman saved me: I pretended a violent\ndisorder of my head, and a feverish heat, that indisposed me too much to\nreceive his embraces. He gave in to this, and good naturedly desisted.\nSoon after, an old lady coming in made a third, very apropos for the\nconfusion I was in, and Mr. H...., after bidding me take care of myself,\nand recommending me to my repose, left me much at ease and relieved by\nhis absence.\n\nIn the close of the evening, I took care to have prepared for me a\nwarm bath of aromatik and sweet herbs; in which having fully laved and\nsolaced myself, I came out voluptuously refreshed in body and spirit.\n\nThe next morning waking pretty early, after a night's perfect rest and\ncomposure, it was not without some dread and uneasiness that I thought\nof what innovation that tender soft system of mine might have sustained,\nfrom the shock of a machine so sized for its destruction.\n\nStruck with this apprehension, I scarce dared to carry my hand thither,\nto inform myself of the state and posture of things.\n\nBut I was soon agreeably cured of my fears.\n\nThe silky hair that covered round the borders, now smoothed and\nre-pruned, had resumed its wonted curl and trimness; the fleshy pouting\nlips that had stood the brunt of the engagement, were no longer swollen\nor moisture-drenched; and neither they, nor the passage into which they\nopened, that had suffered so great a dilation, betrayed any the least\nalteration, outwardly or inwardly, to the most curious research,\nnotwithstanding the laxity that naturally follows the warm bath.\n\nThis continuation of that grateful stricture which is in us, to the men,\nthe very jet of their pleasure, I owed, it seems, to a happy habit of\nbody, juicy, plump and furnished, towards the texture of those parts,\nwith a fullness of soft springy flesh, that yielding sufficiently, as it\ndoes, to almost any distension soon recovers itself so as to re-tighten\nthat strict compression of its mantlings and folds, which form the sides\nof the passage, wherewith it so tenderly embraces and closely clips any\nforeign body introduced into it, such as my exploring finger then was.\n\nFinding then every thing in due tone and order, I remember my fears,\nonly to make a jest of them to myself. And now, palpably mistress of\nany size of man, and triumphing in my double achievement of pleasure and\nrevenge, I abandoned myself entirely to the ideas of all the delight I\nhad swam in. I lay stretching out, glowingly alive all over, and tossing\nwith burning impatience for the renewal of joys that had sinned but in\na sweet excess; nor did I lose my longing, for about ten in the morning,\naccording to expectation, Will, my new humble sweetheart, came with a\nmessage from his master, Mr. H...., to know how I did. I had taken care\nto send my maid on an errand into the city, that I was sure would take\nup time enough; and, from the people of the house, I had nothing to\nfear, as they were plain good sort of folks, and wise enough to mind no\nmore other people's business than they could well help.\n\nAll dispositions then made, not forgetting that of lying in bed to\nreceive him, when he was entered the door of my bed chamber, a latch,\nthat I governed by a wire, descended and secured it.\n\nI could not but observe that my young minion was as much spruced out as\ncould be expected from one in his condition: a desire of pleasing that\ncould not be indifferent to me, since it proved that I pleased him;\nwhich, I assure you, was now a point I was not above having in view.\n\nHis hair trimly dressed, clean linen, and, above all, a hale, ruddy,\nwholesome country look, made him out as pretty a piece of woman's meat\nas you could see, and I should have thought any one much out of taste,\nthat could not have made a hearty meal of such a morsel as nature seemed\nto have designed for the highest diet of pleasure.\n\nAnd why should I here suppress the delight I received from this\namiable creature, in remarking each artless look, each motion of\npure indissembled nature, betrayed by his wanton eyes; or shewing,\ntransparently, the glow and suffusion of blood through his fresh, clear\nskin, whilst even his stury rustic pressure wanted not their peculiar\ncharm? Oh! but, say you, this was a young fellow of too low a rank of\nlife to deserve so great a display. May be so: but was my condition,\nstrictly considered, one jot more exalted? or, had I really been much\nabove him, did not his capacity of giving such exquisite pleasure\nsufficiently raise and enoble him, to me, at least? Let who would,\nfor me cherish, respect, and reward the painter's, the statuary's, the\nmusician's art, in proportion to the delight taken in them: but at my\nage, and with my taste for pleasure, a taste strongly constitutional\nto me, the talent of pleasing, with which nature has endowed a handsome\nperson, formed to me the greatest of all merits; compared to which, the\nvulgar prejudices in favour of titles, dignities, honours, and the like,\nheld a very low rank indeed. Nor perhaps would the beauties of the body\nbe so much affected to be held cheap, were they, in their nature, to be\nbought and delivered. But for me, whose natural philosophy all resided\nin the favourite center of sense, and who was ruled by its powerful\ninstinct in taking pleasure by its right handle, I could scarce have\nmade a choice more to my purpose.\n\nMr. H....'s loftier qualifications of birth, fortune and sense, laid\nme under a sort of subjection and constraint, that were far from making\nharmony in the concert of love; nor had he, perhaps, thought me worth\nsoftening that superiority to; but, with this lad, I was more on the\nlevel which love delights in.\n\nWe may say what we please, but those we can be the easiest and freest\nwith, are ever those we like, not to say love the best.\n\nWith this stripling, all whose art of love was the action of it, I\ncould, without check of awe or restraint, give a loose to jay, and\nexecute every scheme of dalliance my fond fancy might put me on, in\nwhich he was, in every sense, a most exquisite companion. And now my\ngreat pleasure lay in humouring all the petulances, all the wanton\nfrolic of a raw novice just fledged, and keen on the burning scent of\nhis game, but unbroken to the sport: and, to carry on the figure, who\ncould better read the wood than he, or stand fairer for the heart of the\nhunt?\n\nHe advanced then to my bed side, and whilst he faultered out his\nmessage, I could observe his colour rise, and his eyes lighten with joy,\nin seeing me in a situation as favourable to his loosest wishes, as if\nhe had bespoke the play.\n\nI smiled, and put out my hand towards him, which he kneeled down to\n(a politeness taught him by love alone, that great master of it) and\ngreedily kissed. After exchanging a few confused questions and answers,\nI asked him if he would come to bed to me, for the little time I could\nventure to detain him. This was just asking a person, dying with hunger,\nto feast upon the dish on earth the most to his palate. Accordingly,\nwithout further reflection, his clothes were off in an instant; when,\nblushing still more at this new liberty, he got under the bed clothes\nI held up to receive him, and was now in bed with a woman for the first\ntime in his life.\n\nHere began the usual tender preliminaries, as delicious, perhaps, as the\ncrowning act of enjoyment itself; which they often beget an impatience\nof, that makes pleasure destructive of itself, by hurrying on the\nfinal period, and closing that scene of bliss, in which the actors\nare generally too well pleased with their parts, not to wish them an\neternity of duration.\n\nWhen we had sufficiently graduated our advances towards the main point,\nby toying, kissing, clipping, feeling my breasts, now round and\nplump, feeling that part of me I might call a furnace mouth, from the\nprodigious intense heat his fiery touches had rekindled there, my young\nsportsman, emboldened by the very freedom he could wish, wontonly takes\nmy hand, and carries it to that enormous machine of his, that stood with\na stiffness! a hardness! an upward bend of erection! and which, together\nwith it bottom dependence, the inestimable bulse of ladies jewels,\nformed a grand showout of goods indeed! Then its dimensions, mocking\neither grasp or span, almost renewed my terrors.\n\nI could not conceive how, or by what means I could take, or put such\na bulk out of sight. I stroked it gently, on which the mutinous rogue\nseemed to swell, and gather a new degree of fierceness and insolence; so\nthat finding it grew not to be trifled with any longer, I prepared for\nrubbers in good earnest.\n\nSlipping then a pillow under me, that I might give him the fairest play,\nI guided officiously with my hand this furious battering ram, whose ruby\nhead, presenting nearest the resemblance of a heart, I applied to its\nproper mark, which lay as finely elevated as we could wish; my hips\nbeing borne up, and my thighs at their utmost extension, the gleamy\nwarmth that shot from it, made him feel that he was at the mouth of the\nindraught, and driving fore right, the powerfully divided lips of that\npleasure-thirsty channel received him. He hesitated a little; then,\nsettled well in the passage, he makes his way up the straights of it,\nwith a difficulty nothing more than pleasing, widening as he went so\nas to distend and smooth each soft furrow: our pleasure increasing\ndeliciously, in proportion to our points of mutual touch increased in\nthat so vital part of me which I had now taken him, all indriven, and\ncompletely sheathed; and which, crammed as it was, stretched splitting\nripe, gave it so gratefully straight an accommodation! so strict a fold!\na suction so fierce! that gave and took unutterable delight. We had now\nreached the closest point of union; but when he beckened to come on the\nfiercer, as if I had ben actuated by a fear of losing him, in the height\nof my fury, I twist my legs round his naked loins, the flesh of which,\nso firm, so springy to the touch, quivered again under the pressure; and\nnow I had him every way encircled and begirt; and having drawn him home\nto me, I kept him fast there, as if I had sought to unite bodies with\nhim at that point. This bred a pause of action, a pleasure stop, whilst\nthat delicate glutton, my nether mouth, as full as it could hold, kept\npalating, with exquisite relish, the morsel that so deliciously ingorged\nit. But nature could not long endure a pleasure that it so highly\nprovoked without satisfying it: pursuing then its darling end, the\nbattery recommenced with redoubled exertion; nor lay I inactive on my\nside, but encountering him with all the impetuosity of motion I was\nmistress of, the downy cloth of our meeting mount was now of real use\nto break the violence of the tilt; and soon, indeed! the highwrought\nagitation, the sweet urgency of this to-and-fro friction, raised the\ntitillation on me to its height; so that finding myself on the point\nof going, and loath to leave the tender partner of my joys behind me, I\nemployed all the forwarding motions and arts my experience suggested to\nme, to promote his keeping me company to our journey's end. I not only\nthen tightened the pleasure-girth round my restless inmate, by a secret\nspring of friction and compression that obeys the will in those parts,\nbut stole my hand softly to that store bag of nature's prime sweets,\nwhich is so pleasingly attached to its conduit pipe, from which we\nreceive them; there feeling, and most gently indeed, squeezing those\ntender globular reservoirs, the magic touch took instant effect,\nquickened, and brought on upon the spur the symptoms of that sweet\nagony, the melting moment of dissolution, when pleasure dies by\npleasure, and the mysterious engine of it overcomes the titillation\nit has raised in those parts, by plying them with the stream of a warm\nliquid, that in itself the highest of all titillations, and which they\nthirstily express and draw in like the hot natured leach, which, to\ncool itself, tenaciously extracts all the moisture within its sphere of\nexecution. Chiming then to me, with exquisite consent, as I melted away,\nhis oily balsamic injection, mixing deliciously with the sluices in flow\nfrom me, sheathed and blunted all the stings of pleasure, whilst a\nvoluptuous languor possest, and still maintained us motionless, and fast\nlocked in one another's arms. Alas! that these delights should be no\nlonger-lived; for now the point of pleasure, unedged by enjoyment, and\nall the brisk sensations flattened upon us, resigned us up to the cool\ncares of insipid life. Disengaging myself then from his embrace, I made\nhim sensible of the reasons there were for his present leaving me; on\nwhich, though reluctantly, he put on his clothes, with as little\nexpedition, however, as he could help, wantonly interrupting himself,\nbetween whiles, with kisses, touches and embraces I could not refuse\nmyself to. Yet he happily returned to his master before he was missed;\nbut, at taking leave, I forced him (for he had sentiments enough to\nrefuse it) to receive money enough to buy a silver watch, that great\narticle of subaltern finery, which he at length accepted of, as a\nremembrance he was carefully to preserve of my affections.\n\nAnd here, Madam, I ought, perhaps, to make you an apology for this\nminute detail of things, that dwelt so strongly upon my memory, after\nso deep an impression; but, besides that this intrigue bred one great\nrevolution in my life, which historical truth requires I should not sink\nfrom you, may I not presume that so exalted a pleasure ought not to be\nungratefully forgotten, or suppressed by me, because I found it in a\ncharacter in low life; where, by the by, it is oftener met with, purer,\nand more unsophisticated, than among the false, ridiculous refinements\nwith which the great suffer themselves to be so grossly cheated by their\npride: the great! than whom, there exist few amongst those they call\nthe vulgar, who are more ignorant of, or who cultivate less, the art of\nliving than they do; they, I say, who for ever mistake things the most\nforeign to the nature of pleasure itself; whose capital favourite object\nis enjoyment of beauty, wherever that rare incaluable gift is found,\nwithout distinction of birth, or station.\n\nAs love never had, so now revenge had no longer any share in my commerce\nin this handsome youth. The sole pleasures of enjoyment were now the\nlink I held to him by: for though nature had done such great maters\nfor him in his outward form, and especially in that superb piece of\nfurniture she had so liberally enriched him with; though he was thus\nqualified to give the senses their richest feast, still there was\nsomething more wanting to create in me, and constitute the passion of\nlove. Yet Will had very good qualities too: gentle, tractable, and, above\nall, grateful; silentious, even to a fault: he spoke, at any time, very\nlittle, but made it up emphatically with action; and, to do him justice,\nhe never gave me the least reason to complain, either of any tendency to\nencroach upon me for the liberties I allowed him, or of his indiscretion\nin blabbing them. There is, then, a fatality in love, or have loved him\nI must; for he was really a treasure, a bit for the Bonne Bouche of a\nduchess; and, to say the truth, my liking for him was so extreme, that\nit was distinguishing very nicely to deny that I loved him.\n\nMy happiness, however, with him did not last long, but found an end\nfrom my own imprudent neglect. After having taken even superfluous\nprecautions against a discovery, our success in repeated meetings\nemboldened me to omit the barely necessary ones. About a month after\nour first intercourse, one fatal morning (the season Mr. H.... rarely\nor never visited me in) I was in my closet, where my toilet stood, in\nnothing but my shift, a bed gown and under petticoat. Will was with me,\nand both ever too well disposed to baulk an opportunity. For my part,\na whim, a wanton toy had just taken me, and I had challenged my man to\nexecute it on the spot, who hesitated not to comply with my humour:\nI was set in the arm chair, my shift and petticoat up, my thighs wide\nspread and mounted over the arms of the chair, presenting the fairest\nmark to Will's drawn weapon, which he stood in act to plunge into me,\nwhen, having neglected to secure the chamber door, and that of the\ncloset standing a-jar, Mr. H.... stole in upon us, before either of us\nwas aware, and saw us precisely in these convicting attitudes.\n\nI gave a great scream, and dropped my petticoat: the thunder-struck\nlad stood trembling and pale, waiting his sentence of death. Mr. H....\nlooked sometimes at one, sometimes at the other, with a mixture of\nindignation and scorn; and, without saying a word, spun upon his heel\nand went out.\n\nAs confused as I was, I heard him very distinctly turn the key, and lock\nthe chamber door upon us, so that there was no escape but through\nthe dining room, where he himself was walking about with distempered\nstrides, stamping in a great chafe, and doubtless debating what he would\ndo with us.\n\nIn the mean time, poor William was frightened out of his senses, and, as\nmuch need as I had of spirits myself, I was obliged to employ them all\nto keep his a little up. The misfortune I had now brought upon him,\nendeared him the more to me, and I could have joyfully suffered any\npunishment he had not shared in. I watered, plentifully, with my tears,\nthe face of the frightened youth, who sat, not having strength to stand,\nas cold and as lifeless as a statue.\n\nPresently Mr. H.... comes in to us again, and made us go before him into\nthe dining room, trembling and dreading the issue, Mr. H.....sat down on\na chair whilst we stood like criminals under examination; and, beginning\nwith me, asked me, with an even firm tone of voice, neither soft nor\nsevere, but cruelly indifferent, what I could say for myself, for having\nabused him in so unworthy a manner, with his own servant too, and how he\nhad deserved this of me?\n\nWithout adding to the guilt of my infidelity, that of an audacious\ndefence of it, in the old style of a common kept miss, my answer was\nmodest, and often interrupted by my tears, in substance as follows:\n\"That I never had a single thought of wronging him\" (which was true),\n\"till I had seen him taking the last liberties with my servant wench\"\n(here he coloured prodigiously), \"and that my resentment at that, which\nI was over-awed from giving vent to by complaints, or explanations with\nhim, had driven me to a course that I did not pretend to justify; but\nthat as to the young man, he was entirely faultless; for that, in\nthe view of making him the instrument of my revenge, I had down right\nseduced him to what he had done; and therefore hoped, whatever he\ndetermined about me, he would distinguish between the guilty and the\ninnocent; and that; for the rest, I was entirely at his mercy.\"\n\nMr. H.... on hearing what I said, hung his head a little; but instantly\nrecovering himself, he said to me, as near as I can retain, to the\nfollowing purpose:\n\n\"Madam, I owe shame to myself, and confess you have fairly turned\nthe tables upon me. It is not with one of your cast of breeding and\nsentiments, that I allow you so much reason on your side, as great\ndifference of the provocations: be it sufficient that I should enter\ninto a discussion of the very to have changed my resolution, in\nconsideration of what you reproach me with; and I own, too, that your\nclearing that rascal there, is fair and honest in you. Renew with you I\ncannot: the affront is too gross. I give you a week's warning to get out\nof these lodgings; whatever I have given you, remains to you; and as I\nnever intend to see you more, the landlord will pay you fifty pieces on\nmy account, with which, and every debt paid, I hope you will own I do\nnot leave you in a worse condition than what I took you up in, or that\nyou deserve of me. Blame yourself only that it is no better.\"\n\nThen, without giving me time to reply, he addressed himself to the young\nfellow:\n\n\"For you, spark, I shall, for your father's sake, take care of you: the\ntown is no place for such an easy fool as thou art; and to-morrow you\nshall set out, under the charge of one of my men, well recommended, in\nmy name, to your father, not to let you return and be spoil'd here.\"\n\nAt these words he went out, after my vainly attempting to stop him, by\nthrowing myself at his feet. He shook me off, though he seemed greatly\nmoved too, and took Will away with him, who, I dare swear, thought\nhimself very cheaply off.\n\nI was now once more a-drift, and left upon my own hands, by a gentleman\nwhom I certainly did not deserve. And all the letters, arts, friends,\nentreaties that I employed within the week of grace in my lodging,\ncould never win on him so much as to see me again. He had irrevocably\npronounced my doom, and submission to it was my only part. Soon after he\nmarried a lady of birth and fortune, to whom, I have heard he proved an\nirreproachable husband.\n\nAs for poor Will, he was immediately sent down to the country to his\nfather, who was an easy farmer, where he was not four months before an\ninn-keepers' buxom young widow, with a very good stock, both in\nmoney and trade, fancied, and perhaps pre-acquainted with his secret\nexcellencies, married him: and I am sure there was, at least, one good\nfoundation for their living happily together.\n\nThough I should have been charmed to see him before he went, such\nmeasures were taken, by Mr. H....'s orders, that it was impossible;\notherwise I should certainly have endeavoured to detain him in town, and\nwould have spared neither offers nor expense to have procured myself the\nsatisfaction of keeping him with me. He had such powerful holds upon my\ninclinations as were not easily to be shaken off, or replaced; as to my\nheart, it was quite out of the question: glad, however, I was from my\nsoul, that nothing worse, and as things turned out, nothing better could\nhave happened to him.\n\nAs to Mr. H..., though views of conveniency made me, at first, exert\nmyself to regain his affection, I was giddy and thoughtless enough to be\nmuch easier reconciled to my failure than I ought to have been; but as I\nnever had loved him, and his leaving me gave me a sort of liberty that I\nhad often longed for, I was soon comforted; and flattering myself, that\nthe stock of youth and beauty I was going to trade with, could hardly\nfail of procuring me a maintenance, I saw myself under the necessity of\ntrying my fortune with them, rather, with pleasure and gaiety, than with\nthe least idea of despondency.\n\nIn the mean time, several of my acquaintances among the sisterhood,\nwho had soon got wind of my misfortune, flocked to insult me with their\nmalicious consolations. Most of them had long envied me the affluence\nand splendour I had been maintained in; and though there was scarce\none of them that did not at least deserve to be in my case, and would\nprobably, sooner or later, come to it, it was equally easy to remark,\neven in their affected pity, their secret pleasure at seeing me\nthus discarded, and their secret grief that it was no worse with me.\nUnaccountable malice of the human heart! and which is not confined to\nthe class of life they were of.\n\nBut as the time approached for me to come to some resolution how to\ndispose of myself, and I was considering, round where to shift my\nquarters to, Mrs. Cole, a middle aged discreet sort of woman, who had\nbeen brought into my acquaintance by one of the misses that visited me,\nupon learning my situation, came to offer her cordial advice and service\nto me; and as I had always taken to her more than to any of my female\nacquaintances, I listened the easier to her proposals. And, as it\nhappened, I could not have put myself into worse, or into better hands\nin all London: into worse, because keeping a house of conveniency, there\nwere no lengths in lewdness she would not advise me to go, in compliance\nwith her customers; no schemes, or pleasure, or even unbounded\ndebauchery, she did not take even a delight in promoting: into a better,\nbecause nobody having had more experience of the wicked part of the\ntown than she had, was fitter to advise and guard one against the worst\ndangers of our profession; and what was rare to be met with in those\nof her's, she contented herself with a moderate living profit upon her\nindustry and good offices, and had nothing of their greedy rapacious\nturn. She was really too a gentlewoman born and bred, but through a\ntrain of accidents reduced to this course, which she pursued, partly\nthrough necessity, partly through choice, as never woman delighted more\nin encouraging a brisk circulation of the trade, for the sake of the\ntrade itself, or better understood all the mysteries and refinements\nof it, than she did; so that she was consummately at the top of her\nprofession, and dealt only with customers of distinction: to answer the\ndemands of whom she kept a competent number of her daughters in constant\nrecruit (so she called those whom their youth and personal charms\nrecommended to her adoption and management: several of whom, by her\nmeans, and through her tuition and instructions, succeeded very well in\nthe world).\n\nThis useful gentlewoman upon whose protection I now threw myself, having\nher reasons of state, respecting Mr. H...., for not appearing too much\nin the thing herself, sent a friend of her's, on the day appointed for\nmy removal, to conduct me to my new lodgings at a brush-maker's in E----\nstreet, Covent Garden, the very next door to her own house, where she\nhad no conveniences to lodge me herself: lodgings that, by having been\nfor several successions tenanted by ladies of pleasures, the landlord\nof them was familiarized to their ways; and provided the rent was paid,\nevery thing else was as easy and commodious as one could desire.\n\nThe fifty guineas promised me by Mr. H...., at his parting with me,\nhaving been duly paid me, all my clothes and moveables chested up, which\nwere at least of two hundred pounds value, I had them conveyed into a\ncoach, where I soon followed them, after taking a civil leave of the\nlandlord and his family, with whom I had never lived in a degree\nof familiarity enough to regret the removal; but still, the very\ncircumstance of its being a removal, drew tears from me. I left, too,\na letter of thanks for Mr. H...., from whom I concluded myself, as I\nreally was, irretrievably separated.\n\nMy maid I had discharged the day before, not only because I had her of\nMr. H...., but that I suspected her of having some how or other been the\noccasion of his discovering me, in revenge, perhaps, for my not having\ntrusted her with him.\n\nWe soon got to my lodgings, which, though not so handsomely furnished,\nnor so showy as those I left, were to the full as convenient, and at\nhalf price, though on the first floor. My trunks were safely landed, and\nstowed in my apartments, where my neighbour, and now gouvernante, Mrs.\nCole, was ready with my landlord to receive me, to whom she took care to\nset me out in the most favourable light, that of one from whom there was\nthe clearest reason to expect the regular payment of his rent: all the\ncardinal virtues attributed to me, would not have had half the weight of\nthat recommendation alone.\n\nI was now settled in lodgings of my own, abandoned to my own conduct,\nand turned loose upon the town, to sink or swim, as I could manage with\nthe current of it; and what were the consequences, together with\nthe number of adventures which befell me in the exercise of my new\nprofession, will compose the mater of another letter: for surely it is\nhigh time to put a period! to this.\n\nI am,\n\nMADAM,\n\nYours, etc., etc., etc.\n\n     THE END OF THE FIRST LETTER\n\n\n\n\nLETTER THE SECOND\n\nMadam:\n\nIf I have delayed the sequel of my history, it has been purely to allow\nmyself a little breathing time not without some hopes, that, instead of\npressing me to a continuation, you would have acquitted me of the task\nof pursuing a confession, in the course of which my self-esteem has so\nmany wounds to sustain.\n\nI imagined, indeed, that you would have been cloyed and tired with\nuniformity of adventures and expressions, inseparable from a subject of\nthis sort, whose bottom, or groundwork being, in the nature of things\neternally one and the same, whatever variety of forms and modes the\nsituations are susceptible of, there is no escaping a repetition of\nnear the same images, the same figures, the same expressions, with this\nfurther inconvenience added to the disgust it creates, that the words\nJoys, Ardours, Transports, Extasies and the rest of those pathetic terms\nso congenial to, so received in the Practice of Pleasure, flatten\nand lose much of their due spirit and energy by the frequency they\nindispensably recur with, in a narrative of which that Practice\nprofessedly composes the whole basis. I must therefore trust to the\ncandour of your judgment, for your allowing for the disadvantage I\nam necessarily under in that respect; and to your imagination and\nsensibility, the pleasing taks of repairing it, by their supplements,\nwhere my descriptions flag or fail: the one will readily place the\npictures I present before your eyes; the other give life to the colours\nwhere they are dull, or worn with too frequent handling.\n\nWhat you say besides, by way of encouragement concerning the extreme\ndifficulty of continuing so long in one strain, in a mean tempered with\ntaste, between the revoltingness of gross, rank and vulgar expressions,\nand the ridicule of mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions, is\nso sensible, as well as good-natured, that you greatly justify me to\nmyself for my compliance with a curiosity that is to be satisfied so\nextremely at my expense.\n\nResuming now where I broke off in my last, I am in my way to remark to\nyou, that it was late in the evening before I arrived at my lodgings,\nand Mrs. Cole, after helping me to range and secure my things, spent\nthe whole evening with me in my apartment, where we supped together, in\ngiving me the best advice and instruction with regard to the new stage\nof my profession I was now to enter upon; and passing thus from a\nprivate devotee to pleasure into a public one, to become a more general\ngood, with all the advantages requisite to put my person out to use,\neither for interest or pleasure, or both. \"But then,\" she observed, \"as\nI was a kind of new face upon the town, that is, was an established rule\nand myster of trade, for me to pass for a maid and dispose of myself\nas such on the first good occasion, without prejudice, however, to such\ndiversions as I might have a mind to in the interim; for that nobody\ncould be a greater enemy than she was to the losing of time. That she\nwould, in the mean time, do her best to find out a proper person, and\nwould undertake to manage this nice point for me, if I would accept\nof her aid and advice to such good purpose, that, in the loss of a\nfictitious maidenhead, I should reap all the advantages of a native\none.\"\n\nAs too great a delicacy of sentiments did not extremely belong to my\ncharacter at that time, I confess, against myself, that I perhaps too\nreadily closed with a proposal which my candor and ingenuity gave me\nsome repugnance to: but not enough to contradict the intention of one to\nwhom I had now thoroughly abandoned the direction of all my steps. For\nMrs. Cole had, I do not know how unless by one of those unaccountable\ninvincible sympathies that, nevertheless, from the strongest links,\nespecially of female friendship, won and got entire possession of me. On\nher side, she pretended that a strict resemblance, she fancied she saw\nin me, to an only daughter whom she had lost at my age, was the first\nmotive of her taking to me so affectionately as she did. It might be so:\nthere exist a slender motives of attachment, that, gathering force from\nhabit and liking, have proved often more solid and durable than those\nfounded on much stronger reasons; but this I know, that though I had\nno other acquaintance with her, than seeing her at my lodgings, when\nI lived with Mr. H..., where she had made errands to sell me some\nmillinery ware, she had by degrees insinuated herself so far into my\nconfidence, that I threw myself blindly into her hands, and came,\nat length, to regard, love, and obey her implicitly; and, to do her\njustice, I never experienced at her hands other than a sincerity of\ntenderness, and care for my interest, hardly heard of in those of\nher profession. We parted that night, after having settled a perfect\nunreserved agreement; and the next morning Mrs. Cole came, and took me\nwith her to her house for the first time.\n\nHere, at the first sight of things, I found every thing breathe an air\nof decency, modesty and order.\n\nIn the outer parlour, or rather shop, sat three young women, rather\ndemurely employed on millinery work, which was the cover of a traffic in\nmore precious commodities; but three beautifuller creatures could hardly\nbe seen. Two of them were extremely fair, the eldest not above nineteen;\nand the third, much about that age, was a piquant brunette, whose black\nsparking eyes, and perfect harmony of features and shape, left her\nnothing to envy in her fairer companions. Their dress too had the more\ndesign in it, the less it appeared to have, being in a taste of uniform\ncorrect neatness, and elegant simplicity. These were the girls that\ncomposed the small domestic flock, which my governess trained up with\nsurprising order and management, considering the giddy wildness of young\ngirls once got upon the loose. But then she never continued any in her\nhouse, whom, after a due noviciate, she found un-tractable, or unwilling\nto comply with the rules of it. Thus she had insensibly formed a little\nfamily of love, in which the members found so sensibly their account,\nin a rare alliance of pleasure and interest, and of a necessary outward\ndecency, with unbounded secret liberty, that Mrs. Cole, who had picked\nthem as much for their temper as their beauty, governed them with ease\nto herself and them too.\n\nTo these pupils then of hers, whom she had prepared, she presented me\nas a new boarder, and one that was to be immediately admitted to all the\nintimacies of the house; upon which these charming girls gave me all the\nmarks of a welcome reception, and indeed of being perfectly pleased with\nmy figure, that I could possibly expect from any of my own sex: but they\nhad been effectually brought to sacrifice all jealousy, or competition\nof charms, to a common interest, and considered me a partner that was\nbringing no despicable stock of goods into the trade of the house. They\ngathered round me, viewed me on all sides; and as my admission into this\njoyous troop made a little holiday, the shew of work was laid aside; and\nMrs. Cole giving me up, with special recommendation, to their caresses\nand entertainment, went about her ordinary business of the house.\n\nThe sameness of our sex, age, profession, and views, soon creased\nas unreserved a freedom and intimacy as if we had been for years\nacquainted. They took and shewed me the house, their respective\napartments, which were furnished with every article of convenience and\nluxury; and above all, a spacious drawing-room, where a select revelling\nband usually met, in general parties of pleasure; the girls supping\nwith their sparks, and acting their wanton pranks with unbounded\nlicentiousness; whilst a defiance of awe, modesty or jealousy were their\nstanding rules, by which, according to the principles of their society,\nwhatever pleasure was lost on the side of sentiment, was abundantly made\nup to the senses in the poignancy of variety, and the charms of ease and\nluxury. The authors and supporters of this secret institution would, in\nthe height of their humour, style themselves the restorers of the golden\nage and its simplicity of pleasures, before their innocence became so\nunjustly branded with the names of guilt and shame.\n\nAs soon then as the evening began, and the shew of a shop was shut, the\nacademy opened; the mask of mock-modesty was completely taken off, and\nall the girls delivered over to their respective calls of pleasure\nor interest with their men: and none of that sex was promiscuously\nadmitted, but only such as Mrs. Cole was previously satisfied with their\ncharacter and discretion. In short, this was the safest, politest, and,\nat the same time, the most thorough house of accommodation in town:\nevery thing being conducted so, that decency made no intrenchment upon\nthe most libertine pleasures; in the practice of which, too, the choice\nfamiliars of the house had found the secret so rare and difficult, of\nreconciling even all the refinements of taste and delicacy, with the\nmost gross and determinate gratifications of sensuality.\n\nAfter having consumed the morning in the dear endearments and\ninstructions of my new acquaintance, we went to dinner, when Mrs.\nCole, presiding at the head of her club, gave me the first idea of her\nmanagement and address, in inspiring these girls with so sensible a\nlove and respect for her. There was no stiffness, no reserve, no airs of\npique, or little jealousies, but all was unaffectedly gay, cheerful and\neasy.\n\nAfter dinner, Mrs. Cole, seconded by the young ladies, acquainted me\nthat there was a chapter to be held that night in form, for the ceremony\nof my reception into the sisterhood; and in which, with all due reserve\nto my maidenhead, that was to be occasionally cooked up for the first\nproper chapman. I was to undergo a ceremonial of initiation they were\nsure I should not be displeased with.\n\nEmbarked as I was, and moreover captivated with the charms of my new\ncompanions, I was too much prejudiced in favour of any proposal they\ncould make, to as much as hesitate an assent; which, therefore, readily\ngiving in the style of a carte blanche, I received fresh kisses of\ncompliment from them all, in approval of my docility and good nature.\nNow I was \"a sweet girl... I came into things with a good grace... I was\nnot affectedly coy... I should be the pride of the house,\" and the like.\n\nThis point thus adjusted, the young women left Mrs. Cole to talk and\nconcert matters with me, when she explained to me, that \"I should be\nintroduced that very evening, to four of her best friends, one of\nwhom she had, according to the custom of the house, favoured with the\npreference of engaging me in the first party of pleasure;\" assuring me,\nat the same time, \"that they were all young gentlemen agreeable in their\npersons, and unexceptionable in every respect; that united, and holding\ntogether by the band of common pleasures, they composed the chief\nsupport of her house, and made very liberal presents to the girls that\npleased and humoured them, so that they were, properly speaking, the\nfounders and patrons of this little seraglio. Not but that she had, at\nproper seasons, other customers to deal with, whom she stood less upon\npunctilio with, than with these; for instance, it was not on one of them\nshe could attempt to pass me for a maid; they were not only too knowing,\ntoo much town-bred to bite at such a bait, but they were such generous\nbenefactors to her, that it would be unpardonable to think of it.\"\n\nAmidst all the flutter and emotion which this promise of pleasure, for\nsuch I conceived it, stirred up in me, I preserved so much of the woman,\nas to feign just reluctance enough to make some merit, of sacrificing it\nto the influence of my patroness, whom I likewise, still in character,\nreminded of it perhaps being right for me to go home and dress, in\nfavour of my first impressions.\n\nBut Mrs. Cole, in opposition to this, assured me, \"that the gentlemen\nI should be presented to were, by their rank and taste of things,\ninfinitely superior to the being touched with any glare of dress or\nornaments, such slick women rather confound and overlay than set off\ntheir beauty with; that these veteran voluptuaries knew better than not\nto hold them in the highest contempt: they with whom the pure native\ncharms alone could pass current, and who would at any time leave a\nsallow, washy, painted duchess on her own hands, for a ruddy, healthy\nfirm fleshed country maid; and as for my part, that nature had\ndone enough for me, to set me above owing the least favour to art;\"\nconcluding withal, that for the instant occasion, there was no dress\nlike an undress.\n\nI thought my governess too good a judge of these matters, not to\nbe easily overruled by her: after which she went on preaching very\npathetically the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance to\nall those arbitrary tastes of pleasure, which are by some styled the\nrefinements, and by others the depravations of it; between whom it was\nnot the business of a simple girl, who was to profit by pleasing, to\ndecide, but to conform to. Whilst I was edifying by these wholesome\nlessons, tea was brought in, and the young ladies, returning, joined\ncompany with us.\n\nAfter a great deal of mixed chat, frolic and humour, one of them,\nobserving that there would be a good deal of time on and before the\nassembly hour, proposed that each girl should entertain the company\nwith that critical period of her personal history, in which she first\nexchanged the maiden state for womanhood. The proposal was approved,\nwith only one restriction of Mrs. Cole, that she, on account of her age,\nand I, on account of my titular maidenhead, should be excused, at\nleast till I had undergone the forms of the house. This obtained me a\ndispensation, and the promotress of this amusement was desired to begin.\n\nHer name was Emily; a girl fair to excess, and whose limbs were, if\npossible, too well made, since their plump fulness was rather to the\nprejudice of that delicate slimness required by the nicer judges of\nbeauty; her eyes were blue, and streamed inexpressible sweetness, and\nnothing could be prettier than her mouth and lips, which closed over a\nrange of the evenest and whitest teeth. Thus she began:\n\n\"Neither my extraction, nor the most critical adventure of my life, is\nsublime enough to impeach me of any vanity in the advancement of the\nproposal you have approved of. My father and mother were, and for aught\nI know, are still, farmers in the country, not above forty miles from\ntown: their barbarity to me, in favour of a son, on whom alone they\nvouchsafed to bestow their tenderness, had a thousand times determined\nme to fly their house, and throw myself on the wide world; but, at\nlength, an accident forced me on this desperate attempt at the age of\nfifteen. I had broken a chinabowl, the pride and idol of both their\nhearts; and as an unmerciful beating was the least I had to depend on at\ntheir hands, in the silliness of these tender years, I left the house,\nand, at all adventures, took the road to London. How my loss was\nresented I do not know, for till this instant I have not heard\na syllable about them. My whole stock was two broad pieces of my\ngodmother's, a few shillings, silver shoe-buckles and a silver thimble.\nThus equipped, with no more clothes than the ordinary ones I had on my\nback, and frightened at every foot or noise I heard behind me, I hurried\non; and I dare sweare, walked a dozen miles before I stopped, through\nmere weariness and fatigue. At length I sat down on a style, wept\nbitterly, and yet was still rather under increased impressions of fear\non the account of my escape; which made me dread, worse than death, the\ngoing back to my unnatural parents. Refreshed by this little repose, and\nrelieved by my tears, I was proceeding onward, when I was overtaken by a\nsturdy country lad, who was going to London to see what he could do for\nhimself there, and, like me, had given his friends the slip. He could\nnot be above seventeen, was ruddy, well featured enough, with uncombed\nflaxen hair, a little flapped hat, kersey frock, yarn stockings, in\nshort, a perfect plough boy. I saw him come whistling behind me, with a\nbundle tied to the end of a stick, his travelling equipage. We walked by\none another for some time without speaking; at length we joined company,\nand agreed to keep together till we got to our journey's end; what his\ndesigns or ideas were, I know not: the innocence of mine I can solemnly\nprotest.\n\n\"As night drew on, it became us to look out for some inn or shelter; to\nwhich perplexity another was added, and that was, what we should say for\nourselves, if we were questioned. After some puzzle, the young fellow\nstarted a proposal, which I thought the finest that could be; and what\nwas that? why, that we should pass for husband and wife: I never dreamed\nof consequences. We came presently, after having agreed on this notable\nexperience, to one of those hedge accommodations for foot passengers,\nat the door of which stood an old crazy beldam, who seeing us trudge by,\ninvited us to lodge there. Glad of any cover, we went in, and my fellow\ntraveller, taking all upon him, called for what the house afforded, and\nwe supped together as man and wife; which, considering our figures and\nages, could not have passed on any one but such as any thing could\npass on. But when bed-time came on, we had neither of us the courage\nto contradict our first account of ourselves; and what was extremely\npleasant, the young lad seemed as perplexed as I was how to evade lying\ntogether, which was so natural for the state we had pretended to. Whilst\nwe were in this quandary, the landlady takes the candles, and lights\nus to our apartment, through a long yard, at the end of which it stood,\nseparate from the body of the house. Thus we suffered ourselves to be\nconducted, without saying a word in opposition to it; and there, in a\nwretched room, with a bed answerable, we were left to pass the night\ntogether, as a thing quite of course. For my part, I was so incredibly\ninnocent, as not even to think much more harm of going into bed with the\nyoung man, than with one of our dairy wenches; nor had he, perhaps, any\nother notions than those of innocence, till such a fair occasion put\nthem into his head.\n\n\"Before either of us undressed, however, he put out the candle; and the\nbitterness of the weather made it a kind of necessity for me to go into\nbed: slipping then my clothes off, I crept under the bedclothes, where\nI found the young stripling already nestled, and the touch of his warm\nflesh rather pleased than alarmed me. I was indeed too much disturbed\nwith the novelty of my condition to be able to sleep; but then I had\nnot the least thought of harm. But oh! how powerful are the instincts\nof nature! how little is there wanting to set them in action! The young\nman, sliding his arm under my body, drew me gently towards him, as if\nto keep himself and me warmer; and the heat I felt from joining our\nbreasts, kindled another that I had hitherto never felt, and was,\neven then, a stranger to the nature of. Emboldened, I suppose, by my\neasiness, he ventured to kiss me, and I insensibly returned it; without\nknowing the consequence of returning it: for, on this encouragement, he\nslipped his hand all down from my breast to that part of me where the\nsense of feeling is so exquisitely critical, as I then experienced by\nits instant taking fire upon the touch, and glowing with a strange\ntickling heat: there he pleased himself and me, by feeling, till growing\na little too bold with me, he hurt me, and made me complain. Then he\ntook my hand, which he guided, not unwillingly on my side, between the\ntwist of his closed thighs, which were extremely warm; there he lodged\nand pressed it, till raising it by degrees, he made me feel the proud\ndistinction of his sex from mine. I was frightened at the novelty,\nand drew back my hand; yet, pressed and spurred on by sensations of a\nstrange pleasure, I could not help asking him what that was for? He\ntold me he would shew me if I would let him; and without waiting for\nmy answer, which he prevented by stopping my mouth with kisses I was\nfar from disrelishing, he got upon me, and inserting one of his thighs\nbetween mine, opened them so as to make way for himself, and fixed me to\nhis purpose; whilst I was so much out of my usual sense, so subdued\nby the present power of a new one, that, between far and desire, I lay\nutter passive, till the piercing pain rouzed and made me cry out. But\nit was too late: he was too firm fixed in the saddle for me to compass\nflinging him, with all the struggles I could use, some of which only\nserved to further his point, and at length an irresistible thrust\nmurdered at once my maidenhead, and almost me. I now lay a bleeding\nwitness of the necessity imposed on our sex, to gather the first honey\noff the thorns.\n\n\"But the pleasure rising as the pain subsided, I was soon reconciled to\nfresh trials, and before morning, nothing on earth could be dearer to me\nthan this rifler of my virgin sweets: he was every thing to me now.\n\n\"How we agreed to join fortunes: how we came up to town together, where\nwe lived some time, till necessity-parted us, and drove me into this\ncourse of life, to which I had been long ago bettered and torn to pieces\nbefore I came to this age, as much through my easiness, as through\ninclination, had it not been for my finding refuge in this house: these\nare all circumstances which pass the mark I proposed, so that here my\nnarrative ends.\"\n\nIn the order of our sitting, it was Harriet's turn to go on. Amongst\nall the beauties of our sex, that I had before, or have since seen, few\nindeed were the forms that could dispute excellence with her's; it was\nnot delicate, but delicacy itself incarnate, such was the symmetry of\nher small but exactly fashioned limbs. Her complexion, fair as it\nwas, appeared yet more fair, from the effect of two black eyes, the\nbrilliancy of which gave her face more vivacity than belonged to the\ncolour of it, which was only defended from paleness, by a sweetly\npleasing blush in her cheeks, that grew fainter and fainter, till at\nlength it died away insensibly into the overbearing white. Then her\nminiature features joined to finish the extreme sweetness of it, which\nwas not belied by that of a temper turned to indolence, languor, and\nthe pleasures of love. Pressed to subscribe her contingent, she smiled,\nblushed a little, and thus complied with our desires:\n\n\"My father was neither better nor worse than a miller near the city of\nYork; and both he and my mother dying whilst I was an infant, I fell\nunder the care of a widow and childless aunt, housekeeper to my lord\nN..., at his seat in the county of..., where she brought me up with all\nimaginable tenderness. I was not seventeen, as I am not now eighteen,\nbefore I had, on account of my person purely (for fortune I had\nnotoriously none), several advantageous proposals; but whether nature\nwas slow in making me sensible in her favourite passion, or that I had\nnot seen any of the other sex who had stirred up the least emotion\nor curiosity to be better acquainted with it, I had, till that age,\npreserved a perfect innocence, even of thought: whilst my fears of I\ndid not now well know what, made me no more desirous of marrying than of\ndying. My aunt, good woman, favoured my timorousness, which she loooked\non as childish affection, that her own experience might probably assure\nher would wear off in time, and gave my suitors proper answers for me.\n\n\"The family had not been down at that seat for years, so that it was\nneglected, and committed entirely to my aunt, and two old domestics to\ntake care of it. Thus I had the full range of a spacious lonely house\nand gardens, situated at about half a mile distance from any other\nhabitation, except, perhaps, a straggling cottage or so.\n\n\"Here, in tranquillity and innocence, I grew up without any memorable\naccident, till one fatal day I had, as I had often done before, left my\naunt asleep, and secure for some hours, after dinner; and resorting to a\nkind of ancient summer house, at some distance from the house, I carried\nmy work with me, and sat over a rivulet, which its door and window faced\nupon. Here I fell into a gentle breathing slumber, which stole upon my\nsenses, as they fainted under the excessive heat of the season at\nthat hour; a cane couch, with my work basked for a pillow, were all the\nconveniences of my short repose; for I was soon awaked and alarmed by a\nflounce, and noise of splashing in the water. I got up to see what was\nthe matter; and what indeed should it be but the son of a neighbouring\ngentleman, as I afterwards found (for I had never seen him before),\nwho had strayed that way with his gun, and heated by his sport, and the\nsultriness of the day, had been tempted by the freshness of the clear\nstream; so that presently stripping, he jumped into it on the other\nside, which bordered on a wood, some trees whereof, inclined down to the\nwater, formed a pleasing shady recess, commodious to undress and leave\nhis clothes under.\n\n\"My first emotions at the sight of this youth, naked in the water, were,\nwith all imaginable respect to truth, those of surprise and fear;\nand, in course, I should immediately have run out, had not my modesty,\nfatally for itself, interposed the objection of the door and window\nbeing so situated, that it was scarce possible to get out, and make my\nway along the bank to the house, without his seeing me: which I could\nnot bear the thought of, so much ashamed and confounded was I at having\nseen him. Condemned then to stay till his departure should release me,\nI was greatly embarrassed how to dispose of myself: I kept some time\nbetwixt terror and modesty, even from looking through the window, which\nbeing an old fashioned casement, without any light behind me, could\nhardly betray any one's being there to him from within; then the door\nwas so secure, that without violence, or my own consent, there was no\nopening it from without.\n\n\"But now, by my own experience, I found it too true, that objects which\naffright us, when we cannot get from them, draw our eyes as forcibly as\nthose that please us. I could not long withstand that nameless impulse,\nwhich, without any desire of this novel sight, compelled me towards\nit; emboldened too by my certainty of being at once unseen and safe,\nI ventured by degrees to cast my eyes on an object so terrible and\nalarming to my virgin modesty as a naked man.\n\n\"But as I snatched a look, the first gleam that struck me, was in general\nthe dewy lustre of the whitest skin imaginable, which the sun playing\nupon made the reflection of it perfectly beamy. His face, in the\nconfusion I was in, I could not well distinguish the lineamints of, any\nfarther than that there was a great deal of youth and freshness in it.\nThe frolic and various play of all his fine polished limbs, as they\nappeared above the surface, in the course of his swimming or wantoning\nwith the water, amused and insensibly delighted me; sometimes he lay\nmotionless, on his back, waterborne, and dragging after him a fine head\nof hair, that, floating, swept the stream in a bush of black curls. Then\nthe overflowing water would make a separation between his breast and\nglossy white belly; at the bottom of which I could not escape observing\nso remarkable a distinction, as a black mossy tuft, out of which\nappeared to emerge a round, softish, limber, white something, that\nplayed every way, with ever the least motion or whirling eddy. I cannot\nsay but that part chiefly, by a kind of natural instinct, attracted,\ndetained, captivated my attention: it was out of the power of all my\nmodesty to command my eye away from it; and seeing nothing so very\ndreadful in its appearance, I insensibly looked away all my fears: but\nas fast as they gave way, new desires and strange wishes took place, and\nI melted as I gazed. The fire of nature, that had so long lain dormant\nor concealed, began to break out, and made me feel my sex for the first\ntime. He had now changed his posture, and swam prone on his belly,\nstriking out with his legs and arms; finer modeled than which could\nnot have been cast, whilst his floating locks played over a neck and\nshoulders whose whiteness they delightfully set off. Then the luxuriant\nswell of flesh that rose from the small of his back, and terminates its\ndouble cope at where the thighs are set off, perfectly dazzled one with\nits watery glistening gloss.\n\n\"By this time I was so affected by this inward involution of sentiments,\nso softened by this sight, that now, betrayed into a sudden transition\nfrom extreme fears to extreme desires, I found these last so strong upon\nme, the heat of the weather too perhaps conspiring to exalt their\nrage, that nature almost fainted under them. Not that I so much as knew\nprecisely what was wanting to me: my only thought was, that so sweet\na creature, as this youth seemed to me, could only make me happy; but\nthen, the little likelihood there was of compassing an acquaintance with\nhim, or perhaps of ever seeing him again, dashed my desires, and turned\nthem into torments. I was still gazing, with all the powers of my sight,\non this bewitching object, when, in an instant, down he went. I had\nheard of such things as a cramp seizing on even the best swimmers, and\noccasioning their being drowned; and imagining this so sudden eclipse\nto be owing to it, the inconceivable fondness this unknown lad had given\nbirth to, distracted me with the most killing terrors; insomuch, that my\nconcern giving the wings, I flew to the door, opened it, ran down to\nthe canal, guided thither by the madness of my fears for him, and the\nintense desire of being an instrument to save him, though I was ignorant\nhow, or by what means to effect it: but was it for fears, and a passion\nso sudden as mine, to reason! All this took up scarce the space of a few\nmoments. I had then just life enough to reach the green borders of the\nwaterpiece, where wildly looking round for the young man, and missing\nhim still, my fright and concern sunk me down in a deep swoon, which\nmust have lasted me some time; for I did not come to myself, till I was\nroused out of it by a sense of pain that pierced me to the vitals, and\nawaked me to the the most surprising circumstance of finding myself not\nonly in the arms of this very young gentleman I had been so solicitous\nto save; but taken at such an advantage in my unresisting condition,\nthat he had actually completed his entrance into me so far, that\nweakened as I was by all the preceding conflicts of mind I had suffered,\nand struck dumb by the violence of my surprise, I had neither the power\nto cry out, nor the strength to disengage myself from his strenuous\nembraces, before, urging his point, he had forced his way and completely\ntriumphed over my virginity, as he might now as well see by the\nstreams of blood that followed his drawing out, as he had felt by the\ndifficulties he had met with consummating his penetration. But the\nsight of the blood, and the sense of my condition, had (as he told me\nafterwards), since the ungovernable rage of his passion was somewhat\nappeased, now wrought so far on him, that at all risks, even of the\nworst consequences, he could not find in his heart to leave me, and make\noff, which he might easily have done. I still lay all discomposed\nin bleeding ruin, palpitating, speechless, unable to get off, and\nfrightened, and fluttering like a poor wounded partridge, and ready\nto faint away again at the sense of what had befallen me. The young\ngentleman was by me, kneeling, kissing my hand, and with tears in his\neyes, beseeching me to forgive him, and offering all the reparation in\nhis power. It is certain that could I, at the instant of regaining my\nsenses, have called out, or taken the bloodiest revenge, I would not\nbe stuck at it; the violation was attended too with such aggravating\ncircumstances, though he was ignorant of them, since it was to my\nconcern for the preservation of his life, that I owed my ruin.\n\n\"But how quick is the shift of passions from one extreme to another! and\nhow little are they acquainted with the human heart who dispute it! I\ncould not see this amiable criminal, so suddenly the first object of my\nlove, and as suddenly of my just hate, on his knees, bedewing my hands\nwith his tears, without relenting. He was still stark-naked, but my\nmodesty had been already too much wounded, in essentials, to be so much\nshocked as I should have otherwise been with appearances only; in short,\nmy anger ebbed so fast, and the tide of love returned so strong upon\nme, that I felt it a point of my own happiness to forgive him. The\nreproaches I made him were murmured in so soft a tone, my eyes met his\nwith such glances, expressing more languor than resentment, that he\ncould not but presume his forgiveness was at no desperate distance; but\nstill he would not quit his posture of submission, till I had\npronounced his pardon in form; which after the most fervent entreaties,\nprotestations, and promises, I had not the power to withhold. On which,\nwith the utmost marks of a fear of again offending, he ventured to\nkiss my lips, which I neither declined nor resented: but on my mild\nexpostulation with him upon the barbarity of his treatment, he explained\nthe mystery of my ruin, if not entirely to the clearance, at least much\nto the alleviation of his guilt, in the eyes of a judge so partial in\nhis favour as I was grown.\n\n\"It seems that the circumstance of his going down, or sinking, which\nin my extreme ignorance I had mistaken for something very fatal, was no\nother than a trick of diving, which I had not ever heard, or at least\nattended o, the mention of: and he was so long-breathed at it, that in\nthe few moments in which I ran out to save him, he had not yet emerged,\nbefore I fell into the swoon, in which, as he rose, seeing me extended\non the bank, his first idea was, that some young woman was upon some\ndesign of frolic or diversion with him, for he knew I could not have\nfallen asleep there without his having seen me before: agreebly to which\nnotion he had ventured to approach, and finding me without sign of life,\nand still perplexed as he was what to think of the adventure, he took\nme in his arms at all hazards, and carried me into the summer-house, of\nwhich he observed the door open: there he laid me down on the couch, and\ntried, as he protested in good faith, by several means to bring me to\nmyself again, till fired, as he said, beyond all bearing by the sight\nand touch of several parts of me, which were unguardedly exposed to him,\nhe could no longer govern his passion; and the less, as he was not quite\nsure that his first idea of this swoon being a feint, was not the very\ntruth of the case; seduced then by this flattering notion, and overcome\nby the present, as he styled them, super-human temptations, combined\nwith the solitude and seeming security of the attempt, he was not enough\nhis own master not to make it. Leaving me then just only whilst he\nfastened the door, he returned with redoubled eagerness to his prey:\nwhen, finding me still entranced, he ventured to place me as he pleased,\nwhilst I felt, no more than the dead, what he was about, till the pain\nhe put me to roused me just in time enough to be witness of a triumph I\nwas not able to defeat, and now scarce regretted: for as he talked,\nthe tone of his voice sounded, methought, so sweetly in my ears, the\nsensible nearness of so new and interesting an object to me, wrought so\npowerfully upon me, that, in the rising perception of things in a new\nand pleasing light, I lost all sense of the past injury. The young\ngentleman soon discerned the symptoms of a reconciliation in my softened\nlooks, and hastening to receive the seal of it from my lips, pressed\nthem tenderly to pass his pardon in the return of a kiss so melting\nfiery, that the impression of it being carried to my heart, and thence\nto my new discovered sphere of Venus, I was melted into a softness\nthat could refuse him nothing. When now he managed his caresses and\nendearments so artfully, as to insinuate the most soothing consolations\nfor the past pain and the most pleasing expectations of future pleasure,\nbut whilst mere modesty kept my eyes from seeing his and rather declined\nthem, I had a glimpse of that instrument of mischief which was now,\nobviously even to me, who had scarce had snatches of a comparative\nobservation of it, resuming its capacity to renew it, and grew greatly\nalarming with its increase of size, as he bore it no doubt designedly,\nhard and stiff against one of my hands carelessly dropt; but then he\nemployed such tender prefacing, such winning progressions, that my\nreturning passion of desire being now so strongly prompted by the\nengaging circumstances of the sight and incendiary touch of his\nnaked glowing beauties, I yield at length at the force of the present\nimpressions, and he obtained of my tacit blushing consent all the\ngratifications of pleasure left in the power of my poor person to\nbestow, after he had cropt its richest flower, during my suspension of\nlife, and abilities to guard it. Here, according to the rule laid down,\nI should stop; but I am so much in notion, that I could not if I would.\nI shall only add, however, that I got home without the least discovery,\nor suspicion of what had happened. I met my young ravisher several times\nafter, whom I now passionately loved and who, though not of age to\nclaim a small but independent fortune, would have married me; but as the\naccident that prevented it, and its consequences, which threw me on the\npublic, contain matters too moving and serious to introduce at present,\nI cut short here.\"\n\nLouisa, the brunette whom I mentioned at first, now took her turn to\ntreat the company with her history. I have already hinted to you the\ngraces of her person, than which nothing could be more exquisitely\ntouching; I repeat touching, as a just distinction from striking, which\nis ever a less lasting effect, and more generally belongs to the fair\ncomplexions; but leaving that decision to every one's taste, I proceed\nto give you Louisa's narrative as follows:\n\n\"According to practical maxims of life, I ought to boast of my birth,\nsince I owe it to pure love, without marriage; but this I know, it was\nscarce possible to inherit a stronger propensity to that cause of my\nbeing than I did. I was the rare production of the first essay of a\njourneyman cabinet-maker, on his master's maid: the consequence of which\nwas a big belly, and the loss of a place. He was not in circumstances to\ndo much for her; and yet, after all this blemish, she found means, after\nshe had dropt her burthen, and disposed of me to a poor relation in\nthe country, to repair it by marrying a pastry-cook here in London,\nin thriving business; on whom she soon, under favour of the complete\nascendant he had given her over him, passed me for a child she had by\nher first husband. I had, on that footing, been taken home, and was\nnot six years old when this father-in-law died, and left my mother\nin tolerable circumstances, and without any children by him. As to my\nnatural father, he had betaken himself to the sea; where, when the truth\nof things came out, I was told that he died, not immensely rich you may\nthink, since he was no more than a common sailor. As I grew up, under\nthe eyes of my mother, who kept on the business, I could not but see,\nin her severe watchfulness, the marks of a slip, which she did not\ncare should be hereditary; but we no more choose our passions than\nour features or complexions, and the bent of mine was so strong to the\nforbidden pleasure, that it got the better, at length, of all her care\nand precaution. I was scarce twelve years old, before that part\nwhich she wanted so much to keep out of harm's way, made me feel its\nimpatience to be taken notice of, and come into play; already had it\nput forth the signs of forwardness in the sprout of a soft down over it,\nwhich had often fluttered, and I might also say, grown under my constant\ntouch and visitation, so pleased was I with what I took to be a kind\nof title to womanhood, that state I pined to be entered of, for the\npleasures I conceived were annexed to it; and now the growing importance\nof that part to me, and the new sensations in it, demolished at once all\nmy girlish play-things and amusements. Nature now pointed me strongly\nto more solid diversions, while all the stings of desire settled so\nfiercely in that little centre of them, that I could not mistake the\nspot I wanted a playfellow in.\n\n\"I now shunned all company in which there was no hopes of coming at\nthe object of my longings, and used to shut myself up, to indulge in\nsolitude some tender meditation on the pleasure I strongly perceived the\noverture of, in feeling and examining what nature assured me must be the\nchosen avenue, the gates for unknown bliss to enter at, that I panted\nafter.\n\n\"But these meditations only increased my disorder, and blew the fire\nthat consumed me. I was yet worse when, yielding at length to the\ninsupportable irritations of the little fairy charm that tormented me,\nI seized it with my fingers, teazing it to no end. Sometimes, in the\nfurious excitations of desire, I threw myself on the bed, spread my\nthighs abroad, and lay as it were expecting the longed-for relief, till\nfinding my illusion, I shut and squeezed them together again, burning\nand fretting. In short, this develish thing, with its impetuous girds\nand itching fires, led me such a life, that I could neither, night or\nday, be at peace with it or myself. In time, however, I thought I had\ngained a prodigious prize, when figuring to myself that my fingers were\nsomething of the shape of what I pined for, I worked my way in with one\nof them with great agitation and delight; yet not without pain too did I\ndeflower myself as far as it could reach; proceeding with such a fury of\npassion, in this solitary and last shift of pleasure, as extended me at\nlength breathless on the bed in an amorous melting trance.\n\n\"But frequency of use dulling the sensation, I soon began to perceive\nthat this work was but a paultry shallow expedient, that went but a\nlittle way to relieve me, and rather raised more flame than its dry and\ninsignificant titillation could rightly appease.\n\n\"Man alone, I almost instinctively knew, as well as by what I had\nindustriously picked up at weddings and christenings, was possessed of\nthe only remedy that could reduce this rebellious disorder; but watched\nand overlooked as I was, how to come at it was the point, and that, to\nall appearance, an invincible one; not that I did not rack my brains and\ninvention how at once to elude my mothers vigilance, and procure myself\nthe satisfaction of my impetuous curiosity and longings for this mighty\nand untasted pleasure. At length, however, a singular chance did at once\nthe work of a long course of alertness. One day that we had dined at\nan acquaintance over the way, together with a gentlewoman-lodger that\noccupied the first floor of our house, there started an indispensable\nnecessity for my mother's going down to Greenwich to accompany her: the\nparty was settled, when I do not know what genius whispered me to plead\na headache, which I certainly had not, against my being included in a\njaunt that I had not the least relish for. The pretext, however, passed,\nand my mother, with much reluctance, prevailed with herself to go\nwithout me; but took particular care to see me safe home, where she\nconsigned me into the hands of an old trusty maidservants, who served in\nthe shop, for we had not a male creature in the house.\n\n\"As soon as she was gone, I told the maid I would go up and lie down on\nour lodger's bed, mine not being made, with a charge to her at the same\ntime not to disturb me, as it was only rest I wanted. This injunction\nprobably proved of eminent service to me. As soon as I was got into the\nbedchamber, I unlaced my stays, and threw myself on the outside of the\nbedclothes, in all the loosest undress. Here I gave myself up to the old\ninsipid privy shifts of my self-viewing, self-touching self-enjoying,\nin fine, to all the means of self knowledge I could devise, in search\nof the pleasure that fled before me, and tantalized with that unknown\nsomething that was out of my reach; thus all only served to enflame\nmyself, and to provoke violently my desires, whilst the one thing\nneedful to their satisfaction was not at hand, and I could have bit my\nfinger for representing it so ill. After then wearying and fatiguing\nmyself with grasping shadows, whilst that most sensible part of me\ndisdained to content itself with less than realities, the strong\nyearnings, the urgent struggles of nature towards the melting relief,\nand the extreme self-agitations I had used to come at it, had wearied\nand thrown me into a kind of unquiet sleep: for, if I tossed and threw\nabout my limbs in proportion to the distraction of my dreams, as I had\nreason to believe I did, a bystander could not have helped seeing all\nfor love. And one there was it seems; for waking out of my very short\nslumber, I found my hand locked in that of a young man, who was.\nkneeling at my bed-side, and begging my pardon for his boldness: but\nthat being a son to the lady to whom, this bed-chamber, he knew,\nbelonged, he had slipped by the servant of the shop, as he supposed,\nunperceived, when finding me asleep, his first ideas were to withdraw;\nbut that he had been fixed and detained there by a power he could better\naccount for, than resist.\n\n\"What shall I say? my emotions of fear and surprise were instantly\nsubdued by those of the pleasure I bespoke in great presence of mind\nfrom the turn this adventure might take. He seemed to me no other than a\npitying angel, dropt out of the clouds: for he was young and perfectly\nhandsome, which was more than even I had asked for, man, in general,\nbeing all that my utmost desires had pointed at. I thought then I could\nnot put too much encouragement into my eyes and voice; I regretted no\nleading advances; no matter for his after-opinion of my forwardness,\nso it might bring him to the point of answering my pressing demands of\npresent case; it was not now with his thoughts but his actions that my\nbusiness immediately lay. I raised then my head, and told him, in a soft\ntone, that tended to prescribe the same key to him, that his mamma was\ngone out and would not return till late at night: which I thought no\nbad hint; but as it proved, I had nothing of a novice to deal with. The\nimpressions I had made on him from the discoveries I had betrayed of my\nperson in the disordered motions of it, during his view of me asleep,\nhad, as he afterwards told me, so fixed and charmingly prepared\nhim, that, had I known his dispositions, I had more to hope from his\nviolence, than to fear from his respect; and even less than the extreme\ntenderness which I threw into my voice and eyes, would have served to\nencourage him to make the most of the opportunity. Finding then that his\nkisses, imprinted on my hand, were taken as tamely as he could wish,\nhe rose to my lips; and glewing his to them, made me so faint with\novercoming joy and pleasure, that I fell back, and he with me, in\ncourse, on the bed, upon which I had, by insensibly shifting from the\nside to near the middle, invitingly, made room for him. He is now lain\ndown by me, and the minutes being too precious to consume in ultimate\nceremony, or dalliance, my youth proceeds immediately to those\nextremities, which all my looks, humming and palpitations, had assured\nhim he might attempt without the fear of a repulse: those rogues the\nmen, read us admirably on these occasions. I lay then at length panting\nfor the imminent attack, with wishes far beyond my fears, and for which\nit was scarce possible for a girl, barely thirteen, but tall and well\ngrown, to have better dispositions. He threw up my petticoat and shift,\nwhilst my thighs were, by an instinct of nature, unfolded to their best;\nand my desires had so thoroughly destroyed all modesty in me, that even\ntheir being now naked and all laid open to him, was part of the prelude\nthat pleasure deepened my blushes at, more than same. But when his hand,\nand touches, naturally attracted to their center, made me feel all their\nwantonness and warmth in, and round it, oh! how immensely different a\nsense of things, did I perceive there, than when under my own insipid\nhandling! And now his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and the confinement\nof the breeches burst through, when out started to view the amazing,\npleasing object of all my wishes, all my dreams, all my love, the king\nmember indeed! I gazed at, I devoured it, at length and breadth, with\nmy eyes intently directed to it, till his; getting upon me, and placing\nbetween my thighs, took from me the enjoyment of its sight, to give me a\nfar more grateful one, in its touch, in that part where its touch is so\nexquisitely affecting. Applying it then to the minute opening, for such\nat that age it certainly was, I met with too much good will, I felt with\ntoo great a rapture of pleasure the first insertion of it, to heed much\nthe pain that followed: I thought nothing too dear to pay for this the\nrichest treat of the sense; so that, split up, torn, bleeding, mangled\nI was still superiorly pleased, and hugged the author of all this\ndelicious ruin. But when, soon after, he made his second attack, sore as\nevery thing was, the smart was soon put away by the sovereign cordial;\nall my soft complainings were silenced, and the pain melting fast away\ninto pleasure. I abandoned myself over to all its transports, and gave\nit the full possession of my whole body and soul; for now all thought\nwas at an end with me; I lived in what I felt only. And who could\ndescribe those feelings, those agitations, yet exalted by the charm of\ntheir novelty and surprise? when that part of me which had so hungered\nfor the dear morsel that now so delightfully crammed, forced all my\nvital sensations to fix their home there, during the stay of my beloved\nguest; who too soon paid me for his hearty welcome, in a dissolvent,\nricher far than that I have heard of some queen treating her paramour\nwith, in liquified pearl, and ravishingly poured into me, where, now\nmyself too much melted to give it a dry reception, I hailed it with the\nwarmest confluence on my side, amidst all those ecstatic raptures, not\nunfamiliar I presume to this good company. Thus, however, I arrived at\nthe very top of all my wishes, by an accident unexpected indeed, but\nnot so wonderful; for this young gentleman was just arrived in town from\ncollege, and came familiarly to his mother at her apartment, where he\nhad once before been, though, by mere chance. I had not seen him: so\nthat we knew one another by hearing only; and finding me stretched on\nhis mother's bed, he readily concluded from her description, who it was.\nThe rest you know.\n\n\"This affair had however no ruinous consequences, the young gentleman\nescaping then, and many more times undiscovered. But the warmth of my\nconstitution, that made the pleasures of love a kind of necessary of\nlife to me, having betrayed me into indiscretions fatal to my private\nfortune, I fell at length to the public; from which, it is probable, I\nmight have met with the worst of ruin, if my better fate had not thrown\nme into this safe and agreeable refuge.\"\n\nHere Louisa ended; and these little histories having brought the time\nfor the girls to retire, and to prepare for the revels of the evening, I\nstaid with Mrs. Cole, till Emily came, and told us the company was met,\nand waited for us.\n\nMrs. Cole on this, taking me by the hand, with a smile of encouragement,\nled me up stairs, preceded by Louisa, who was come to hasten us, and\nlighted us with two candles, one in each hand.\n\nOn the landing-place of the first pair of stairs, we were met by a young\ngentleman, extremely well dressed, and a very pretty figure, to whom I\nwas to be indebted for the first essay of the pleasures of the house.\nHe saluted me with great gallantry, and handed me into the drawing room,\nthe floor of which was overspread with a Turkey carpet, and all its\nfurniture voluptuously adapted to every demand of the most studied\nluxury; now too it was, by means of a profuse illumination, enlivened\nby a light scarce inferior, and perhaps more favourable to joy, more\ntenderly pleasing, than that of broad sunshine.\n\nOn my entrance into the room, I had the satisfaction! to hear a buzz of\napprobation run through the whole company, which now consisted of four\ngentlemen, including my particular (this was the cant term of the\nhouse for one's gallant for the time), the three young-women, in a\nneat flowing dishabille, the mistress of the academy, and myself. I was\nwelcomed and saluted by a kiss all round, in which, however, it was easy\nto-discover, in the superior warmth of that of the men, the distinction\nof the sexes.\n\nAwed, and confounded as I was, at seeing myself surrounded, caressed,\nand made court to by so many strangers, I could not immediately\nfamiliarize myself to all that air of gaiety and joy, which dictated\ntheir compliments, and animated their caresses.\n\nThey assured me that I was so perfectly to their taste, as to have but\none fault against me, which I might easily be cured of, and that was\nmy modesty: this, they observed, might pass for a beauty the more with\nthose who wanted it for a heigh tener; but their maxim was, that it was\nan impertinent mixture, and dashed the cup so as to spoil the sincere\ndraught of pleasure; they considered it accordingly as their mortal\nenemy, and gave it no quarter wherever they met with it. This was a\nprologue not unworthy of the revels that ensued.\n\nIn the midst of all the frolic and wantonness, which this joyous band\nhad presently, and all naturally, run into, an elegant supper was served\nin, and we sat down to it, my spark elect placing himself next to me,\nand the other couples without order or ceremony. The delicate cheer and\ngood wine soon banished all reserve; the conversation grew as lively as\ncould be wished, without taking too loose a turn: these professors of\npleasure knew too well, how to stale impressions of it, or evaporate\nthe imagination of words, before the time of action. Kisses however were\nsnatched at times, or where a handkerchief round the neck interposed\nits feeble barrier, it was not extremely respected: the hands of the men\nwent to work with their usual petulance, till the provocation on both\nsides rose to such a pitch, that my particulars's proposal for beginning\nthe country dances was received with instant assent: for, as he\nlaughingly added, he fancied the instruments were in tune. This was a\nsignal for preparation, that the complaisant Mrs. Cole, who understood\nlife, took for her cue of disappearing; no longer so fit for personal\nservice herself, and content with having settled the order of battle,\nshe left us the field, to fight it out at discretion.\n\nAs soon as she was gone, the table was removed from the middle, and\nbecame a side-board; a couch was brought into its place, of which when I\nwhisperingly inquired the reason, of my particular, he told me, \"that\nas it was chiefly on my account that his convention was met, the parties\nintended at once to humour their taste of variety in pleasures, and by\nan open public enjoyment, to see me broke of any taint of reserve or\nmodesty, which they looked on as the poison of joy; that though they\noccasionally preached pleasure, and lived up to the text, they did not\nenthusiastically set up for missionaries, and only indulged themselves\nin the delights of a practical instruction of all the pretty women they\nliked well enough to bestow it upon, and who fell properly in the way of\nit; but that as such a proposal might be too violent, too shocking for a\nyoung beginner, the old standers were to set an example, which he hoped\nI would not be averse to follow, since it was to him I was devolved in\nfavour of the first experiment; but that still I was perfectly at my\nliberty to refuse the party, which being in its nature one of pleasure,\nsupposed an exclusion of all force or constraint.\"\n\nMy countenance expressed, no doubt, my surprise as my silence did my\nacquiescence. I was now embarked, and thoroughly determined on any\nvoyage the company would take me on.\n\nThe first that stood up, to open the ball, were a cornet of horse, and\nthat sweetest of olive-beauties, the soft and amorous Louisa. He led her\nto the couch (nothing loth), on which he gave her the fall, and extended\nher at length with an air of roughness and vigour, relishing high of\namorous eagerness and impatience. The girl, spreading herself to the\nbest advantage, with her head upon the pillow, was so concentered in\nthat she was about, that our presence was the least of her care and\nconcern. Her petticoats, thrown up with her shift, discovered to the\ncompany the finest turned legs and thighs that could be imagined, and\nin broad display, that gave us a full view of that delicious cleft of\nflesh, into which the pleasing hair, grown mount over it, parted and\npresented a most inviting entrance, between two close hedges, delicately\nsoft and pouting. Her gallant was now ready, having disencumbered\nhimself from his clothes, overloaded with lace, and presently, his shirt\nremoved, shewed us his forces at high plight, bandied and ready for\naction. But giving us no time to consider the dimensions, he threw\nhimself instantly over his charming antagonist who received him as he\npushed at once dead at mark, like a heroine, without flinching; for\nsurely never was girl constitutionally truer to the taste of joy, or\nsincerer in the expressions of its sensations, than she was: we\ncould observe pleasure lighten in her eyes, as he introduced his\nplenipotentiary instrument into her; till, at length, having indulged\nher to its utmost reach, its irritations grew so violent, and gave her\nthe spurs so furiously, that collected within herself, and lost to every\nthing but the enjoyment of her favourite feelings, she retarded his\nthrusts with a just concert of spring heaves, keeping time so exactly\nwith the most pathetic sighs, that one might have numbered the strokes\nin agitation by their distinct murmurs, whilst her active limbs kept\nwreathing and intertwisting with his, in convulsive folds: then the\nturtle-billing kisses, and the poignant painless lovebites, which they\nboth exchanged, in a rage of delight, all conspiring towards the\nmelting period. It soon came on, when Louisa, in the ravings of her\npleasure-frensy, impotent of all restraint, cried out: \"Oh Sir!... Good\nSir! pray do not spare me! ah! ah!...\" All her accents now faultering\ninto heart-fetched sighs, she closed her eyes in the sweet death, in\nthe instant of which we could easily see the signs in the quiet, dying,\nlanguid posture of her late so furious driver, who was stopped of a\nsudden, breathing short, panting, and, for that time, giving up the\nspirit of pleasure. As soon as he was dismounted, Louisa sprung up,\nshook her petticoats, and running up to me, gave me a kiss, and drew me\nto the side-board, to which she was herself handed by her gallant, where\nthey made me pledge them in a glass of wine, and toast a droll health of\nLouisa's proposal in high frolic.\n\nBy this time the second couple was ready to enter the lists: which were\na young baronet, and that delicatest of charmers, the winning, tender\nHarriet. My gentle esquire came to acquaint me with it, and brought me\nback to the scene of action.\n\nAnd, surely, never did one of her profession accompany her dispositions,\nfor the barefaced part she was engaged to play, with such a peculiar\ngrace of sweetness, modesty and yielding coyness, as she did. All her\nair and motions breathed only unreserved, unlimited complaisance without\nthe least mixture of impudence, or prostitution. But what was yet more\nsurprising, her spark elect, in the midst of the dissolution of a public\nopen enjoyment, doated on her to distraction, and had, by dint of love\nand sentiments, touched her heart, though for a while the restraint\nof their engagement to the house laid him under a kind of necessity of\ncomplying with an institution which himself had had the greatest share\nestablishing.\n\nHarriet was then led to the vacant couch by her gallant, blushing as\nshe looked at me, and with eyes made to justify any thing, tenderly\nbespeaking of me the most favourable construction of the step she was\nthus irresistibly drawn into.\n\nHer lover, for such he was, sat her down at the foot of the couch, and\npassing his arm round her neck, preluded with a kiss fervently applied\nto her lips, that visibly gave her life and spirit to go through with\nthe scene; and as he kissed, he gently inclined her head, till it fell\nback on a pillow disposed to receive it, and leaning himself down all\nthe way with her, at once countenanced and endeared her fall to her.\nThere, as if he had guessed our wishes, or meant to gratify at once his\npleasure and his pride, in being the master, by the title of present\npossession, of beauties delicate beyond imagination, he discovered her\nbreast to his own touch, and our common view; but oh! what delicious\nmanual of love devotion; how inimitable fine moulded! small, round,\nfirm, and excellently white; then the grain of their skin, so soothing,\nso flattering to the touch! and of beauty. When he had feasted his eyes\nwith the their nipples, that crowned them, the sweetest buds touch and\nperusal, feasted his lips with kisses of the highest relish, imprinted\non those all delicious twin-orbs, he proceeded downwards.\n\nHer legs still kept the ground; and now, with the tenderest attention\nnot to shock or alarm her too suddenly, he, by degrees, rather stole\nthan rolled up her petticoats; at which, as if a signal had been given,\nLouisa and Emily took hold of her legs, in pure wantonness, and, in ease\nto her, kept them stretched wide abroad. Then lay exposed, or, to speak\nmore properly, displayed the greatest parade in nature of female charms.\nThe whole company, who, except myself, had often seen them, seemed as\nmuch dazzled, surprised and delighted, as any one could be who had now\nbeheld them for the first time. Beauties so excessive could not but\nenjoy the privileges of eternal novelty. Her thighs were so exquisitely\nfashioned, that either more in, or more out of flesh than they were,\nthey would have declined from that point of perfection they presented.\nBut what infinitely enriched and adorned them, was the sweet\nintersection formed, where they met, at the bottom of the smoothest,\nroundest, whitest belly, by that central furrow which nature had sunk\nthere, between the soft relievo of two pouting ridges, and which, in\nthis girl, was in perfect symmetry of delicacy and miniature with the\nrest of her frame. No! nothing in nature could be of a beautifuller cut;\nthen, the dark umbrage of the downy spring moss that over-arched it,\nbestowed, on the luxury of the landscape, a touching warmth, a tender\nfinishing, beyond the expression of words, or even the paint of thought.\n\nHer truly enamoured gallant, who had stood absorbed and engrossed by the\npleasure of the sight long enough to afford us time to feast ours (no\nfear of glutting!) addressed himself at length to the materials of\nenjoyment, and lifting the linen veil that hung between us and his\nmaster member of the revels, exhibited one whose eminent size proclaimed\nthe owner a true woman's hero. He was, besides in every other respect,\nan accomplished gentleman, and in the bloom and vigour of youth.\nStanding then between Harriet's legs, which were supported by her two\ncompanions at their widest extension, with one hand he gently disclosed\nthe lips of that luscious mouth of nature, whilst with the other, he\nstooped his mighty machine to its lure, from the height of his stiff\nstand-up towards his belly; the lips, kept open by his fingers, received\nits broad shelving head of coral hue: and when he had nestled it in, he\nhovered there a little, and the girls then delivered over to his hips\nthe agreeable office of supporting her thighs; and now, as if he meant\nto spin out his pleasure, and give it the more play for its life, he\npassed up his instrument so slow that we lost sight of it inch by inch,\ntill at length it was wholly taken into the soft laboratory of love, and\nthe mossy mounts of each fairly met together. In the mean time, we could\nplainly mark the prodigious effect the progressions of this delightful\nenergy wrought in this delicious girl, gradually heightening her beauty\nas they heightened her pleasure. Her countenance and whole frame grew\nmore animated; the faint blush of her cheeks, gaining ground on the\nwhite, deepened into a florid vivid vermillion glow, her naturally\nbrilliant eyes now sparkled with ten-fold lustre; her languor was\nvanished, and she appeared quick, spirited and alive all over. He had\nnow fixed, nailed, this tender creature, with his home-driven wedge,\nso that she lay passive by force, and unable to stir, till beginning\nto play a strain of arms against this vein of delicacy, as he urged the\nto-and-fro con-friction, he awakened, roused, and touched her so to the\nheart, that unable to contain herself, she could not but reply to his\nmotions, as briskly as her nicety of frame would admit of, till the\nraging stings of the pleasure rising towards the point, made her wild\nwith the intolerable sensations of it, and she now threw her legs and\narms about at random, as she lay lost in the sweet transport; which on\nhis side declared itself by quicker, eager thrusts, convulsive gasps,\nburning sighs, swift laborious breathing, eyes darting humid fires: all\nfaithful tokens of the imminent approaches of the last gasp of joy.\nIt came on at length: the baronet led the extasy, which she critically\njoined in, as she felt the melting symptoms from him, in the nick of\nwhich, gluing more ardently than ever his lips to hers, he shewed all\nthe signs of that agony of bliss being strong upon him, in which he gave\nher the finishing titillation; inly thrilled with which, we saw plainly\nthat she answered it down with all effusion of spirit and matter she was\nmistress of, whilst a general soft shudder ran through all her limbs,\nwhich she gave a stretch out, and lay motionless, breathless, dying with\ndear delight; and in the height of its expression, showing, through the\nnearly closed lids of her eyes, just the edges of their black, the rest\nbeing rolled strongly upwards in their extasy; then her sweet mouth\nappeared languish-ingly open, with the tip of her tongue leaning\nnegligently towards the lower range of her white teeth, whilst natural\nruby colour of her lips glowed with heightened life. Was not this a\nsubject to dwell upon? And accordingly her lover still kept on her, with\nan abiding delectation, till compressed, squeezed and distilled to the\nlast drop, he took leave with one fervent kiss, expressing satisfied\ndesires, but unextinguished love.\n\nAs soon as he was off, I ran to her, and sitting down on the couch by\nher, rais'd her head, which she declined gently, and hung on my bosom,\nto hide her blushes and confusion at what had passed, till by degrees\nshe re-composed herself, and accepted of a restorative glass of wine\nfrom my spark, who had left me to fetch it to her, whilst her own\nwas readjusting his affaire and buttoning up; after which he led her,\nleaning languish-ingly upon him, to oar stand of view round the couch.\n\nAnd now Emily's partner had taken her out for her share in the dance,\nwhen this transcendently fair and sweet tempered creature readily stood\nup; and if a com-extreme pretty features, and that florid health and\ncomplexion to put the rose and lily out of countenance, extreme pretty\nfeatures, and that florid health and bloom for which the country girls\nare so lovely, might pass her for a beauty, this she certainly was, and\none of the most striking of the fair ones.\n\nHer gallant began first, as she stood, to disengage, her breasts, and\nrestore them to the liberty of nature, from the easy confinement of no\nmore than a pair of jumps; but on their coming out to view, we thought\na new light was added to the room, so superiourly shining was their\nwhiteness; then they rose in so happy a swell as to compose her a well\nhorned fullness of bosom, that had such an effect on the eye as to seem\nflash hardened into marble, of which it emulated the polished gloss, and\nfar surpassed even the whitest, in the life and lustre of its\ncolours, white weined with blue. Who could refrain from such provoking\nenticements in reach? he touched her breasts, first lightly, when the\nglossy smoothness of the skin eluded his hand, and made it slip along\nthe surface; he pressed them, and the springy flesh that filled them,\nthus pitted by force, rose again reboundingly with his hand, and on the\ninstant defaced the pressure: and alike indeed was the consistence\nof all those parts of her body throughout, where the fulness of flesh\ncompacts and constitutes all that fine firmness which the touch is so\nhighly attached to. When he had thus largely pleased himself with this\nbranch of dalliance and delight, he trussed up her petticoat and shift,\nin a wisp to her waist, where being tucked in, she stood fairly naked\non every side; a blush at this overspread her lovely face, and her eyes\ndowncast to the ground, seemed to be for quarter, when she had so great\na right to triumph in all the treasures of youth and beauty that she now\nso victoriously displayed. Her legs were perfectly well shaped and\nher thighs, which she kept pretty close, shewed so white, so round, so\nsubstantial and abounding in firm flesh, that nothing could afford a\nstronger recommendation to the luxury of the touch, which he accordingly\ndid not fail to indulge in. Then gently removing her hand, which in the\nfirst emotion of natural modesty, she had carried thither, he gave\nus rather a glimpse than a view of that soft narrow chink running\nits little length downwards, and hiding the remains of it between her\nthighs; but plain was to be seen the fringe of light-brown curls, in\nbeauteous growth over it, that with their silk gloss created a pleasing\nvariety from the surrounding white, whose lustre too, their gentle\nembrowning shade, considerably raised. Her spark then endeavoured, as\nshe stood, by disclosing her thighs, to gain us a completer sight of\nthat central charm of attraction, but not obtaining it so conveniently\nin that attitude, he led her to the foot of the couch, and bringing\nit to one of the pillows gently inclined her head down, so that as she\nleaned with it over her crossed hands, straddling with her thighs wide\nspread, and jutting her body out, she presented a full back view of\nher person, naked to her waist. Her posteriors, plump, smooth, and\nprominent, formed luxuriant tracts of animated snow, that splendidly\nfilled the eye, till it was commanded down the parting or separation\nof those exquisitely white cliffs, by their narrow vale, and was there\nstopt, and attracted by the embowered bottom-savity, that terminated\nthis delightful vista and stood moderately gaping from the influence of\nher bended posture, so that the agreeable interior red of the sides of\nthe orifice came into view, and with respect to the white that dazzled\nround it, gave somewhat the idea of a pink slash in the glossiest white\nsatin. Her gallant, who was a gentleman about thirty, somewhat inclined\nto a fatness that was in no sort displeasing, improving the hint thus\ntendered him of this mode of enjoyment, after setting her well in this\nposture, and encouraging her with kisses and caresses to stand him\nthro', drew out his affair ready erected, and whose extreme length,\nrather disproportioned to its breadth, was the more surprising, as that\nexcess is not often the case with those of his corpulent habit; making\nthen the right and direct application, he drove it up to the guard,\nwhilst the round bulge of those Turkish beauties of her's, tallying\nwith the hollow made with the bent of his belly and thighs, as he curved\ninwards, brought all those parts, surely not un-delightfully, into warm\ntouch, and close conjunction; his hands he kept passing round her body,\nand employed in toying with her enchanting breasts. As soon too as she\nfelt him at home as he could reach, she lifted her head a little from\nthe pillow, and turning her neck, without much straining, but her\ncheeks glowing with the deepest scarlet, and a smile of the tenderest\nsatisfaction, met the kiss he pressed forward to give her as they were\nthus close joined together: when leaving him to pursue his delights, she\nhid again her face and blushes with her hands and pillow, and thus stood\npassively and as favourably too as she could, whilst he kept laying at\nher with repeated thrusts and making the meeting flesh on both sides\nresound again with the violence of them; then ever as he backened from\nher, we could see between them part of his long white staff foamingly in\nmotion, till, as he went on again and closed with her, the interposing\nhillocks took it out of sight. Sometimes he took his hands from the\nsemi-globes of her bosom, and transferred the pressure of them to\nthose large ones, the present subjects of his soft blockade, which he\nsqueezed, grasped and played with, till at length in pursuit of driving,\nso hotly urged, brought on the height of the fit, with such overpowering\npleasure, that his fair partner became now necessary to support him,\npanting, fainting and dying as he discharged; which she no sooner felt\nthe killing sweetness of, than unable to keep her legs, and yielding to\nthe mighty intoxication, she reeld, and falling forward on the couch,\nmade it a necessity for him, if he would preserve the warm-pleasure\nhold, to fall upon her, where they perfected, in a continued conjunction\nof body and extatic flow, their scheme of joys for that time.\n\nAs soon as he had disengaged, the charming Emily got up, and we crowded\nround her with congratulations and other officious little services; for\nit is to be noted, that though all modesty and reserve were banished\nfrom the transaction of these pleasures, good manners and politeness\nwere inviolably observed: there was no gross ribaldry, no offensive\nor rude behaviour, or ungenerous reproaches to the girls for their\ncompliance With the humours and desires of the men. On the contrary,\nnothing was wanting to soothe, encourage, and soften the sense of their\ncondition to them. Men know not in general how much they destroy of\ntheir own pleasure, when they break through the respect and tenderness\ndue to our sex, and even to those of it who live only by pleasing\nthem. And this was a maxim perfectly well understood by these polite\nvoluptuaries, these profound adepts in the great art and science of\npleasure, who never shewed these votaries of theirs a more tender\nrespect than at the time of those exercises of their complaisance, when\nthey unlocked their treasures of concealed beauty, and shewed out in the\npride of their native charms, ever more touching surely than when they\nparade it in the artificial ones of dress and ornament.\n\nThe frolic was now come round to me, and it being my turn of\nsubscription to the will and pleasure of my particular elect, as well\nas to that of the company, he came to me, and saluting me very tenderly,\nwith a flattering eagerness, put me in mind of the compliances my\npresence there authorized the hopes of, and at the same time repeated to\nme, \"that if all this force of example had not surmounted any repugnance\nI might have to concur with the humours and desires of the company, that\nthough the play was bespoke for my benefit, and great as his own private\ndisappointment might be, he would suffer any thing, sooner than be the\ninstrument of imposing a disagreeable task.\"\n\nTo this I answered, without the least hesitation, or mincing grimace,\n\"that had I not even contracted a kind of engagement to be at his\ndisposal without the least reserve, the example of such agreeable\ncompanions would alone determine me, and that I was in no pain about any\nthing but my appearing to so great a disadvantage after such superior\nbeauties.\" And take notice that I thought, as I spoke. The frankness\nof the answer pleased them all; my particular was complimented on his\nacquisition, and, by way of indirect flattery to me, openly envied me.\n\nMrs. Cole, by the way, could not have given me a greater mark of her\nregard than in managing for me the choice of this young gentleman for\nmy master of the ceremonies: for, independent of his noble birth and the\ngreat fortune he was heir to, his person was even uncommonly pleasing,\nwell shaped and tall; his face marked with the small-pox, but no more\nthan what added a grace of more manliness to features rather turned to\nsoftness and delicacy, was marvellously enlivened by eyes which were of\nthe clearest sparkling black; in short he was one whom any woman would,\nin the familiar style, ready call a very pretty fellow.\n\nI was now handed by him to the cockpit of our match, where, as I was\ndressed in nothing but a white morning gown, he vouchsafed to play the\nmale Abigail on this occasion, and spared me the confusion that would\nhave attended the forwardness of undressing myself: my gown then was\nloosen'd in a trice, and I divested of it; my stays next offered an\nobstacle which readily gave way, Louisa very readily furnished a pair of\nscissors to cut the lace; off went that shell and dropping my uppercoat,\nI was reduced to my under one and my shift, the open bosom of which gave\nthe hands and eyes all the liberty they could wish. Here I imagined the\nstripping was to stop, but I reckon short; my spark, at the desire of\nthe rest, tenderly begged, that I would not suffer the small remains of\na covering to rob them of a full view of my whole person; and for me,\nwho was too flexibly obsequious to dispute any point with them, and who\nconsidered the little more that remained as very immaterial, I readily\nassented to whatever he pleased-In an instant, then, my under petticoat\nwas untied and at my feet, and my shift drawn over my head, so that my\ncap, slightly fastened, came off with it, and brought all my hair down\n(of which, be it again remembered without vanity, that I had a very fine\nhead) in loose disorderly ringlets, over my neck and shoulders, to the\nno unfavourable set-off of my skin.\n\nI now stood before my judges in all the truth of nature, to whom I could\nnot appear a very disagreeable figure, if you please to recollect what\nI have beforesaid of my person, which time, that at certain periods of\nlife robs use every instant of our charms, had, at that of mine, then\ngreatly improved into full and open, bloom, for I wanted some months\nof eighteen. My breasts, which in the state of nudity are ever capital\npoints, now in no more than in graceful plenitude, maintained a firmness\nand steady independence of any stay or support, that dared and invited\nthe test of the touch. Then I was as tall, as slim-shaped as could\nbe consistent with all that juicy plumpness of flesh, ever the most\ngrateful to the senses of sight and touch, which I owed to the\nhealth and youth of my constitution. I had not, however, so thoroughly\nrenounced all innate shame, as not to suffer great confusion at the\nstate I saw myself in; but the whole troop round me, men and women,\nrelieved me with every mark of applause and satisfaction, even\nflattering attention to raise and inspire me with even sentiments\nof pride on the figure I made, which my friend gallantly protested,\ninfinitely outshone all other birthday finery whatever; so that had I\nleave to set down, for sincere, all the compliments these connoisseurs\noverwhelmed me with upon this occasion, I might flatter myself with\nhaving passed my examination with the approbation of the learned.\n\nMy friend, however, who for this time had alone the disposal of me,\nhumoured their curiosity, and perhaps his own, so far, that he placed me\nin all the variety of postures and lights imaginable, pointing out\nevery beauty under every aspect of it, not without such parentheses,\nof kisses, such inflammatory liberties of his roving hands, as made all\nshame fly before them, and a blushing glow give place to a warmer one\nof desire, which led me even to find some relish in the present scene.\n\nBut in this general survey, you may be sure, the most material spot of\nme was not excused the strictest visitation; nor was it but agreed, that\nI had not the least reason to be diffident of passing even for a maid,\non occasion; so inconsiderable a flaw had my preceding adventures\ncreated there, and so soon had the blemish of an over-stretch been\nrepaired and worn out at any age, and in my naturally small make in that\npart.\n\nNow, whether my partner had exhausted all the modes of regaling the\ntouch or sight, or whether he was now ungovernably wound up to strike, I\nknow not; but briskly throwing off his clothes, the prodigious heat\nbred by a close room, a great fire, numerous candles, and even the\ninflammatory warmth of these scenes, induced him to lay aside his shirt\ntoo, when his breeches, before loosened, now gave up their contents\nto view, and shew'd in front the enemy I had to engage with, stiffly\nbearing up the port of its head imhooded, and glowing red. Then I\nplainly saw what I had to trust to: it was one of those just true-sized\ninstruments, of which the masters have a better command than the more\nunwieldy, inordinate sized one are generally under. Straining me then\nclose to his bosom, as he stood up foreright against me, and applying to\nthe obvious niche its peculiar idol, he aimed at inserting it, which,\nas I forwardly favoured, he effected at once, by canting up my thighs\nover his naked hips, and made me receive every inch, and close home;\nso-that stuck upon the pleasure-pivot, add clinging round his neck, in\nwhich and in his hair I hid my face, burn-ingly flushing with present\nfeeling as much as with shame, my bosom glued to him; he carried me once\nround the couch, on which he then, without quitting the middle-fastness,\nor dischannelling, laid me down, and began with pleasure-grist. But so\nprovokingly predisposed and primed as we were, by all the moving sights\nof the night, our imagination was too much heated not to melt us of the\nsoonest; and accordingly I no sooner felt the warm spray darted up my\ninwards-, from him, but I was punctually on flow, to share the momentary\nextasy; but I had yet greater reason to boast of our harmony: for\nfinding that all the flames of desire were not yet quenched within\nme, but that rather, like wetted coals, I glowed the fiercer for this\nsprinkling, my hot-mettled spark, sympathizing with me, and loaded for a\ndouble fire, recontinued the sweet battery with undying vigour; greatly\nencouraged to accommodate all my motions to his best advantage and\ndelight; kisses, squeezes, tender murmurs, all came into play, till our\njoys growing more turbulent and riotous, threw us into a fond disorder,\nand as they raged to a point, bore us far from our selves into an\nocean of boundless pleasures, into which we both plunged together in a\ntransport of taste. Now all the impressions of burning desire, from\nthe lively scenes I had been spectatress of, ripened the heat of this\nexercise, and collecting to a head, throbbed and agitated me with\ninsupportable irritations: I perfectly fevered and maddened with their\nexcess. I bid not now enjoy a calm of reason enough to perceive, but\nI extatically, indeed, felt the power of such rare and exquisite\nprovocatives, as the examples of the night had proved towards thus\nexalting our pleasures: which, with great joy. I sensibly found my\ngallant shared in, by his nervous and home expressions of it: his eyes\nflashing eloquent flames, his action infuriated with the stings of it,\nall conspiring to raise my delight, by assuring me of his. Lifted then\nto the utmost pitch of joy that human life can bear, undestroyed by\nexcess, I touched that sweetly critical point, whence scarce prevented\nby the injection from my partner, I dissolved, and breaking out into a\ndeep drawn sigh, sent my whole sensitive soul down to that passage where\nescape was denied it, by its being so deliciously plugged and choked up.\nThus we lay a few blissful instants, overpowered, still, and languid;\ntill, as the sense of pleasure stagnated, we recovered from our trance,\nand he slipt out of me, not however before he had protested his extreme\nsatisfaction by the tenderest kiss and embrace, as well as by the most\ncordial expressions.\n\nThe company, who had stood round us in a profound silence, when all was\nover, helped me to hurry on my clothes in an instant, and complimented\nme on the sincere homage they could not escape observing had been done\nas they termed it--to the sovereignty of my charms, in my receiving a\ndouble payment of tribute at one juncture. But my partner, now dressed\nagain, signalized, above all, a fondness unbated by the circumstance of\nrecent enjoyment; the girls too kissed and embraced me, assuring me\nthat for that time, or indeed any other, unless I pleased, I was to\ngo through no farther public trials, and that I was now consummatedly\ninitiated, and one of them.\n\nAs it was an inviolable law for every gallant to keep to his partner,\nfor the night especially, and even till he relinquished possession over\nto the community, in order to preserve a pleasing property, and to avoid\nthe disgusts and indelicacy of another arrangement, the company, after\na short refection of biscuits and wine, tea and chocolate, served in at\nnow about one in the morning, broke up, and went off in pairs. Mrs. Cole\nhad prepared my spark and me an occasion field-bed, to which we retired,\nand there ended the night in one continued strain of pleasure, sprightly\nand uncloyed enough for us not to have formed one wish for its ever\nknowing an end. In the morning, after a restorative breakfast in bed,\nhe got up, and with very tender assurance of a particular regard for me,\nleft me to the composure and refreshment of a sweet slumber; waking out\nof which, and getting up to dress before Mrs. Cole should come in, I\nfound in one of my pockets a purse of guineas, which he had slipt there;\nand just as I was musing on a liberality I had certainly not expected,\nMrs. Cole came in, to whom I immediately communicated the present, and\nnaturally offered her whatever share she pleased: but assuring me that\nthe gentleman had very nobly rewarded her, she would on no terms, no\nentreaties, no shape I could put it in, receive any part of it. Her\ndenial, she observed, was no affectation of grimace, and proceeded to\nread me such admirable lessons on the economy of my person and my purse,\nas I became amply paid for my general attention and conformity to in\nthe course of my acquaintance with the town. After which, changing the\ndiscourse, she fell on the pleasures of the preceding night, where I\nlearned, without much surprise, as I began to enter on her character,\nthat she had seen every thing that had passed, from a convenient place\nmanaged solely for that purpose, and of which she readily made me the\nconfidante.\n\nShe had scarce finished this, when the little troop of love girls, my\ncompanions, broke in, and renewed their compliments and caresses.. I\nobserved with pleasure, that the fatigues and exercises of the night\nhad not usurped in the least on the life of their complexion, or the\nfreshness of their bloom: this I found, by their confession, was owing\nto the management and advice of our rare directress. They went down then\nto figure it, as usual, in the shop; whilst I repaired to my lodging,\nwhere I employed myself till I returned to dinner at Mrs. Cole's.\n\nHere I staid in constant amusement, with one or other of these charming\ngirls, till about five in the evening; when seized with a sudden drowsy\nfit, I was prevailed on to go up and doze it off on Harriet's bed, who\nleft me on it to my repose. There then I laid down in my clothes, and\nfell fast asleep, and had now enjoyed, by guess, about an hour's rest,\nwhen I was pleasingly disturbed by my new and favourite gallant, who,\nenquiring for me, was readily directed where to find me. Coming then\ninto my chamber, and seeing me lie alone, with my face turned from the\nlight towards the inside of the bed, he, without more ado, just slipped\noff his breeches, for the greater ease and enjoyment of the naked\ntouch; and softly turning up my petticoats and shift behind, opened the\nprospect of the back avenue to the genial seat of pleasure; where, as I\nlay at my side length, inclining rather face downward, I appeared full\nfair, and liable to be entered. Laying himself gently down by me, he\ninvested me behind, and giving me to feel the warmth of his body, as\nhe applied his thighs and belly close to me, and the endeavours of that\nmachine, whose touch has something so exquisitely singular in it, to\nmake its way good into me. I awaked pretty much startled at first, at\nseeing who it was, disposed myself to turn to him, when he gave me a\nkiss, and desiring me to keep my posture, just lifted up my upper thigh,\nand ascertaining the right opening, soon drove it up to the farthest:\nsatisfied with which, and solacing himself with lying so close in those\nparts, he suspended motion, and thus steeped in pleasure, kept me lying\non my side, into him, spoon-fashion, as he termed it, from the snug\nindent of the back part of my thighs, and all upwards, into the space\nof the bending between his thighs and belly; till, after some time,\nthat restless and turbulent inmate, impatient by nature of longer quiet,\nurged him to action, which now prosecuting with all the usual train of\ntoying, kissing, and the like, ended at length in the liquid proof on\nboth sides, that we had not exhausted, or at less were quickly recruited\nof last night's draughts of pleasure in us.\n\nWith this noble and agreeable youth lived I in perfect joy and\nconstancy. He was full bent on keeping me to himself, for the\nhoney-month at least; but his stay in London was not even so long, his\nfather, who had a post in Ireland, taking him abruptly with him, on\nhis repairing thither. Yet even then I was near keeping hold of his\naffection and person, as he had proposed, and I had consented to follow\nhim in order to go to Ireland after him, as soon as he could be settled\nthere; but meeting with an agreeable and advantageous match in that\nkingdom, he chose the wiser part, and forebore sending for me, but\nat the same time took care that I should receive a very magnificent\npresent, which did not however compensate for all my deep regret on my\nloss of him.\n\nThis event also created a chasm in our little society, which Mrs. Cole,\non the foot of her usual caution, was in no haste to fill up; but then\nit redoubled her attention to procure me, in the advantages of a traffic\nfor a counterfeit maidenhead, some consolation for the sort of widowhood\nI had been left in; and this was a scheme she had never lost prospect\nof, and only waited for a proper person to bring it to bear with.\n\nBut I was, it seems, fated to be my own caterer in this, as I had been\nin my first trial of the market.\n\nI had now passed near a month in the enjoyment of all the pleasures of\nfamiliarity and society with my companions, whose particular favourites\n(the baronet excepted, who soon after took Harriet home) had all, on the\nterms of community established in the house, solicited the gratification\nof their taste for variety in my embraces; but I had with the utmost art\nand address, on various pretexts, eluded their pursuit, without giving\nthem cause to complain; and this reserve I used neither out of dislike\nof them, nor disgust of the thing, but my true reason was my attachment\nto my own, and my tenderness of invading the choice of my companions,\nwho outwardly exempt, as they seemed, from jealousy, could not but in\nsecret like me the better for the regard I had for, without making a\nmerit of it to them. Thus easy, and beloved by the whole family, did I\nget on; when one day, that, about five in the afternoon, I stepped over\nto a fruit shop in Covent Garden, to pick some table fruit for myself\nand the young women, I met with the following adventure.\n\nWhilst I was chaffering for the fruit I wanted, I observed myself\nfollowed by a young gentleman, whose rich dress first attracted my\nnotice; for the rest, he had nothing remarkable in his person, except\nthat he was pale, thin-made, and ventured himself upon legs rather of\nthe slenderest. Easy was it to perceive, without seeming to perceive\nit, that it was me he wanted to be at; and keeping his eyes fixed on\nme, till he came to the same basket that I stood at, and cheapening, or\nrather giving the first price asked for the fruit, began his approaches.\nNow most certainly I was not at all out of figure to pass for a modest\ngirl. I had neither the feathers, nor fumet of a taudry town-miss: a\nstraw hat, a white gown, clean linen, and above all, a certain natural\nand easy air of modesty (which the appearances of never forsook me, even\non those occasions that I most brouke in upon it, in practice) were all\nsigns that gave him no opening to conjecture my condition. He spoke to\nme; and this address from a stranger throwing a blush into my cheeks,\nthat still set him wider of the truth, I answered him, with an\nawkwardness and confusion the more apt to impose, as there really was\na mixture of the genuine in them. But when proceeding, on the foot of\nhaving broken the ice, to join discourse, he went into other leading\nquestions, I put so much innocence, simplicity, and even childishness,\ninto my answers, that on no better foundation, liking my person as he\ndid, I will not answer for it, he would have been sworn for my modesty.\nThere is, in short, in the men, when once they are caught, by the eye\nespecially, a fund of cullibility that their lordly wisdom little dreams\nof, and in virtue of which the most sagacious of them are seen so often\nour dupes. Amongst other queries he put to me, one was, whether I was\nmarried? I replied, that I was too young to think of that this many a\nyear. To that of my age, I answered, and sunk a year upon him, passing\nmyself for not above seventeen. As to my way of life, I told him I had\nserved an apprenticeship to a milliner in Preston, and was come to town\nafter a relation, that I had found, on my arrival, was dead, and now\nlived journey-woman to a milliner in town. That last article, indeed,\nwas not much of the side of what I pretended to pass for; but it did\npass, under favour of the growing passion I had inspired him with. After\nhe had next got out of me, very dexterously as he thought, what I had no\nsort of design to make reserve of, my own, my mistress's name, and place\nof abode, he loaded me with fruit, all the rarest and dearest he could\npick out and sent me home, pondering on what might be the consequence of\nthis adventure.\n\nAs soon then as I came to Mrs. Cole's, I related to her all that passed,\non which she very judiciously concluded, that if he did not come after\nme there was no harm done, and that, if he did, as her presage suggested\nto her he would, his character and his views should be well sifted, so\nas to know whether the game was worth the springes; that in the mean\ntime nothing was easier than my part in it, since no more rested on me\nthan to follow her cue and promptership throughout, till the last act.\n\nThe next morning, after an evening spent on his side, as we afterwards\nlearnt, in perquisitions into Mrs. Cole's character in the neighbourhood\n(than which nothing could be more favourable to her designs upon him),\nmy gentleman came in his chariot to the shop, where Mrs. Cole alone\nhad an inkling of his errand. Asking then for her, he easily made a\nbeginning of acquaintance by bespeaking some millinery ware; when, as I\nsat without lifting my eyes, and pursuing the hem of a ruffle with the\nutmost composure and simplicity of industry, Mrs. Cole took notice, that\nthe first impressions I made on him ran no risk of being destroyed by\nthose of Louisa and Emily, who were then sitting at work by me. After\nvainly endeavouring to catch my eyes in rencounter with him (I held my\nhead down, affecting a kind of consciousness of guilt for having, by\nspeaking to him given him encouragement and means of following me), and\nafter giving Mrs. Cole direction when to bring the things home herself,\nand the time he should expect them, he went out, taking with him\nsome goods, that he paid for liberally, for the better grace of his\nintroduction.\n\nThe girls all this time did not in the least smoak the mystery of this\nnew customer; but Mrs. Cole, as soon as we were conveniently alone,\ninsured me, in virtue of her long experience in these matters, \"that\nfor this bout my charms had not missed fire; for by his eagerness, his\nmanner and looks, she was sure he had it: the only point now in doubt\nwas his character and circumstances, which her knowledge of the town\nwould soon gain her the sufficient acquaintance with, to take measure\nupon.\"\n\nAnd effectively, in a few hours, her intelligence served her so well,\nthat she learned that this conquest of mine was no other than Mr.\nNorbert, a gentleman originally of great fortune, which, with a\nconstitution naturally not the best, he had vastly impaired by his\nover-violent pursuit of the vices of the town; in the course of which,\nhaving worn out and staled all the more common modes of debauchery, he\nhad fallen into a taste of maiden-hunting; in which chase he had ruined\na number of girls, sparing no expense to compass his ends, and generally\nusing them well till tired, or cooled by enjoying, or springing a new\nface, he could with more ease disembarrass himself of the old ones, and\nresign them to their fate, as his sphere of achievements of that sort\nlay only amongst such as he could proceed with by way of bargain and\nsale.\n\nConcluding from these premises, Mrs. Cole observed, that a character of\nthis sort was ever a lawful prize; that the sin would be, not to make\nthe best of our market of him; and that she thought such a girl as I\nonly too good for him at any rate, and on any terms.\n\nShe went then, at the hour appointed, to his lodgings in one of our inns\nof court, which were furnished in a taste of grandeur that had a special\neye to all the conveniences of luxury and pleasure. Here she found him\nin ready waiting; and after finishing her business of pretence, and a\nlong conduit of discussions concerning her trade, which she said was\nvery bad, the qualities of her servants, apprentices, journey-women,\nthe discourse naturally landed at length on me, when Mrs. Cole, acting\nadmirably the good old prating gossip, who lets every thing escape her\nwhen her tongue is set in motion, cooked him up a story so plausible\nof me, throwing in every now and then such strokes of art, with all the\nsimplest air of nature, in praise of my person and temper, as finished\nhim finely for her purpose, whilst nothing could be better counterfeited\nthan her innocence of his. But when now fired and on edge, he proceeded\nto drop hints of his design and views upon me, after he had with much\nconfusion and pains brought her to the point (she kept as long aloof\nfrom it as she thought proper) of understanding him, without now\naffecting to pass for a dragoness of virtue, by flying out into those\nviolent and ever suspicious passions, she stuck with the better grace\nand effect to the character of a plain, good sort of woman, that knew\nno harm, and that getting her bread in an honest way, was made of stuff\neasy and flexible enough to be wrought to his ends, by his superior\nskill and address; but, however, she managed so artfully that three or\nfour meetings took place, before he could obtain the least favourable\nhope of her assistance; without which, he had, by a number of fruitless\nmessages, letters, and other direct trials of my disposition, convinced\nhimself there was no coming at me, all which too raised at once my\ncharacter and price with him.\n\nRegardful, however, of not carrying these difficulties to such a\nlength as might afford time for starting discoveries, or incidents,\nunfavourable to her plan, she at last pretended to be won over by mere\ndint of entreaties, promises, and, above all, by the dazzling sum she\ntook care to wind him up to the specification of, when it was now even a\npiece of art to feign, at once, a yielding to the allurements of a great\ninterest, as a pretext for her yielding at all, and the manner of it\nsuch as might persuade him she had never dipped her virtuous fingers in\nan affair of that sort.\n\nThus she led him through all the gradations of difficulty, and\nobstacles, necessary to enhance the value of the prize he aimed at; and\nin conclusion, he was so struck with the little beauty I was mistress\nof, and so eagerly bent on gaining his ends of me, that he left her no\nroom to boast of her management in bringing him up to her mark, he drove\nso plump of himself into every thing tending to make him swallow the\nbait. Not but, in other respects, Mr. Norbert was not clear sighted\nenough, or that he did not perfectly know the town, and even by\nexperience, the very branch of imposition now in practice upon him: but\nwe had his passion our friend so much, he was so blinded and hurried on\nby it, that he would have thought any undeception a very ill office done\nto his pleasure. Thus concurring, even precipitately, to the point she\nwanted him at, Mrs. Cole brought him at last to hug himself on the cheap\nbargain he considered the purchase of my imaginary jewel was to him,\nat no more than three hundred guineas to myself, and a hundred to the\nbrokers: being a slender recompense for all her pains, and all the\nscruples of conscience she had now sacrificed to him for this first time\nof her life; which sums were to be paid down on the nail, upon delivery\nof my person, exclusive of some no inconsiderable presents that had been\nmade in the course of the negociation: during which I had occasionally,\nbut sparingly been introduced into his company, at proper times and\nhours; in which it is incredible how little it seemed necessary to\nstrain my natural disposition to modesty higher, in order to pass it\nupon him for that a very maid: all my looks and gestures ever breathing\nnothing but that innocence which the men so ardently require in us, for\nno other end than to feast themselves with the pleasure of destroying\nit, and which they are so grievously, with all their skill, subject to\nmistakes in.\n\nWhen the articles of the treaty had been fully agreed on, the stipulated\npayments duly secured, and nothing now remained but the execution of the\nmain point, which centered in the surrender of my person up to his free\ndisposal and use, Mrs. Cole managed her objections, especially to his\nlodgings, and insinuations so nicely, that it became his own mere notion\nand urgent request, that this copy of a wedding should be finished at\nher house: \"At first, indeed, she did not care, not she, to have such\ndoings in it... she would not for a thousand pounds have any of the\nservants or apprentices know it... her precious good name would be gone\nfor ever...,\" with the like excuses. However, on superior objections to\nall other expedients, whilst she took care to start none but those which\nwere most liable to them it came round at last to the necessity of her\nobliging' him in that conveniency, and of doing a little more where she\nhad already done so much.\n\nThe night then was fixed, with all possible respect to the eagerness\nof his impatience, and in the mean time Mrs. Cole had omitted no\ninstructions, nor even neglected any preparation, that might enable me\nto come off with honour, in regard to the appearance of my virginity,\nexcept that, favoured as I was by nature with all the narrowness\nof stricture in that part requisite to conduct my designs, I had no\noccasion to borrow those auxiliaries of art that create a momentary\none, easily discovered by the test of a warm bath; and as to the usual\nsanguinary symptoms of defloration, which, if not always, are generally\nattendants on it, Mrs. Cole had made me the mistress of an invention of\nher own, which could hardly miss its effect, and of which more in its\nplace.\n\nEvery thing then being disposed and fixed for Mr. Norbert's reception,\nhe was, at the hour of eleven at night, with all the mysteries of\nsilence and secrecy, let in by Mrs. Cole herself, and introduced into\nher bedchamber, where, in an old-fashioned bed of her's, I lay, fully\nundressed, and panting, if not with the fears of a real maid, at least\nwith those perhaps greater of a dissembled one which gave me an air of\nconfusion and bashfulness that maiden-modesty had all the honour of,\nand was indeed scarce distinguishable from it, even by less partial eyes\nthan those of my lover: so let me call him, for I ever thought the term\n\"cully\" too cruel a reproach to the men, for their abused weakness for\nus.\n\nAs soon as Mrs. Cole, after the old gossipery, on these occasions, used\nto young women abandoned for the first time to the will of man, had\nleft us alone in her room, which, by the bye was well lighted up, at\nhis previous desire, that seemed to bode a stricter examination than\nhe afterwards made, Mr. Norbert, still dressed, sprung towards the bed,\nwhere I got my head under the clothes, and defended them a good while\nbefore he could even get at my lips, to kiss them: so true it is, that a\nfalse virtue, on this occasion, even makes & greater rout and resistance\nthan a true one. From thence he descended to my breasts, the feel I\ndisputed tooth and nail with him till tired with my resistance, and\nthinking probable to give a better account to me, he hurried his clothes\noff in an instant, and came into bed.\n\nMean while by the glimpse I stole of him, I could easily discover a\nperson far from promising any such doughty performances as the storming\nof maidenheads generally requires, and whose flimsy consumptive\ntexture gave him more the air of an invalid that was pressed, than of a\nvolunteer, on such hot service.\n\nAt scarce thirty he had already reduced his strength of appetite down\nto a wretched dependance on forced provocatives, very little seconded\nby the natural power of a body jaded, and racked off to the less by\nconstant repeated over draughts of pleasure, which had done the work of\nsixty winters on his springs of live: leaving him at the same time all\nthe fire and head of youth in his imagination, which served at once to\ntorment and spur him down the precipice.\n\nAs soon as he was in bed, he threw off the bedclothes, which I suffered\nhim to force from my hold, and I now lay as exposed as he could wish,\nnot only to his attacks, but his visitation of the sheets; where in the\nvarious agitations of the body, through my endeavours to defend myself,\nhe could easily assure himself there was no preparation, though, to do\nhim justice, he seemed a less strict examinant than I had apprehended\nfrom so experienced a practitioner. My shift then he fairly tore open,\nfinding I made too much use of it to barricade my breasts, as well as\nthe more important avenue: yet in every thing else he proceeded with all\nthe marks of tenderness and regard to me, whilst the art of my play was\nto shew none for him, I acted them all the niceties, apprehensions, and\nterrors, supposable for a girl perfectly innocent to feel, at so great\na novelty as a naked man in bed with her for the first time. He scarce\neven obtained a kiss but what he ravished; I put his hand away twenty\ntimes from my breasts, where he had satisfied himself of their hardness\nand consistence, with passing for hitherto unhandled goods. But when\ngrown impatient upon the main point, he now threw himself upon me,\nand first trying to examine me with his finger, sought to make himself\nfurther way, I complained of his usage bitterly: \"I thought he would\nnot have served a body so... I was ruined... I did not know what I had\ndone..., I would get up, so I would...;\" and at the same time kept my\nthighs so fast locked, that it was not for strength like his to force\nthem open, or do any good. Finding thus my advantages, and that I had\nboth my own and his motions at command, the deceiving him came so easy,\nthat it was perfectly playing upon velvet. In the mean time his machine,\nwhich was one of those sizes that slip in and out without being minded,\nkept pretty stiffly bearing against that part, which the shutting my\nthighs barred access to; but finding, at length he could do no good by\nmere dint of bodily strength, he resorted to entreaties and arguments:\nto which I only answered, with a tone of shame and timidity, \"that I\nwas afraid he would kill me... Lord!..., would not be served so... I was\nnever so used in all my born days..., I wondered he was not ashamed of\nhimself, so I did...,\" with such silly infantine moods of repulse\nand complaint as I judged best adapted to express the character of\ninnocence, and affright. Pretending, however, to yield at length to the\nvehemence of his insistence, in action and words, I sparing disclosed my\nthighs, so that he could just touch the cloven inlet with the tip of his\ninstrument: but as he fatigued and toiled to get in, a twist of my body,\nso as to receive it obliquely, not only thwarted his admission, but\ngiving a scream, as if he had pierced me to the heart, I shook him off\nme, with such violence that he could not with all his might to it, keep\nthe saddle: vexed indeed at this he seemed, but not in the style of\ndispleasure with me for my skittishness; on the contrary, I dare swear\nhe held me the dearer, and hugged himself for the difficulties that even\nhurt his instant pleasure. Fired, however, now beyond all bearance of\ndelay, he remounts, and begged of me to have patience, stroking and\nsoothing me to it by all the tenderest endearments and protestations\nof what he would moreover do for me; at which, feigning to be somewhat\nsoftened, and abating of the anger that I had shewn at his hurting me so\nprodigiously, I suffered him to lay my thighs aside, and make way for a\nnew trial; but I watched the directions and management of his point so\nwell, that no sooner was the orifice in the least open to it, but I\ngave such a timely jerk as seemed to proceed not from the evasion of his\nentry, but from the pain his efforts at it put me to: a circumstance too\nthat I did not fail to accompany with proper gestures, sighs and cries\nof complaint, of which, \"that he had hurt me... he killed me... I should\ndie...,\" were the most frequent interjections. But now, after repeated\nattempts, in which he had not made the least impression towards gaining\nhis point, at least for that time, the pleasure rose so fast upon him,\nthat he could not check or delay it, and in the vigour and fury\nwhich the approaches of the height of it inspired him, he made one\nfierce-thrust, that had almost put me by my guard, and lodged it so far\nthat I could feel the warm inspersion just within the exterior orifice,\nwhich I had the cruelty not to let him finish there, but threw him out\nagain, not without a most piercing loud exclamation, as if the pain had\nput me beyond all regard of being overheard. It was then easy to observe\nthat he was more satisfied, more highly pleased with the supposed\nmotives of his baulk of consummation, than he would have-been at the\nfull attainment of it. It was on this foot that I solved to myself all\nthe falsity I employed to procure him that blissful pleasure in it,\nwhich most certainly he would not have tasted in the truth of things.\nEased, however, and relieved by one discharge, he now applied himself\nto sooth, encourage, and to put me into humour and patience to bear his\nnext attempt, which he began to prepare and gather force for, from\nall the incentives of the touch and sight which he could think of, by\nexamining every individual part of my whole body, which he declared\nhis satisfaction with, in raptures of applause, kisses universally\nimprinted, and sparing no part of me, in all the eagerest wantonness\nof feeling, seeing, and toying. His vigour, however, did not return so\nsoon, and I felt him more than once pushing at the door, but so little\nin a condition to break in, that I question whether he had the power\nto enter, had I held it ever so open; but this he then thought me too\nlittle acquainted with the nature of things, to have any regret or\nconfusion about, and he-kept fatiguing himself and me for a long time,\nbefore he was in any state to resume his attacks with any prospect of\nsuccess and then I breathed him so warmly, and kept him so at bay, that\nbefore he had made any sensible progress in point of penetration, he was\ndeliciously sweated, and wearied out indeed: so that it was deep in\nthe morning before he achieved his second let-go, about half way of\nentrance, I all the while crying and complaining of his prodigious\nvigour, and the immensity of what I appeared to suffer splitting\nup with. Tired, however, at length, with such athletic drudgery, my\nchampion began now to give out, and to gladly embrace the refreshment of\nsome rest. Kissing me then with much affection, and recommending me to\nmy repose, he presently fell fast asleep, which, as soon as I had well\nsatisfied myself of, I with much composure of body, so as not to wake\nhim by any motion, with much ease and safety too, played of Mrs. Cole's\ndevice for perfecting the signs of my virginity. In each of the head\nbed-posts, just above where the bedsteads are inserted into them,\nthere was a small drawer, so artfully adapted to the mouldings of the\ntimber-work, that it might have escaped even the most curious search:\nwhich drawers were easily opened or shut by the touch of a spring, and\nwere fitted each with a shallow glass tumbler, full of a prepared fluid\nblood, in which lay soaked, for ready use, a sponge, that required no\nmore than gently reaching the hand to it, taking it out and properly\nsqueezing between the thighs, when it yelded a great deal more of the\nred liquid than would save a girl's honour; after which, replacing\nit, and touching the spring, all possibility of discovery, or even of\nsuspicion, was taken away; and this was not the work of the fourth part\nof a minute, and of which ever side one lay, the thing was equally easy\nand practicable, by the double care taken to have each bed-post provided\nalike. True it is, that had he waked and caught me in the act, it would\nat least have covered me with shame and confusion; but them, that he did\nnot, was, with the precautions I took, a risk of a thousand to one in my\nfavour.\n\nAt ease now, and out of all fear of any doubt or suspicion on his side,\nI addressed myself in good earnest to my repose, but could obtain none;\nand in about half an hour's time my gentleman waked again, and turning\ntowards me, I feigned a sound sleep, which he did not long respect; but\ngirding himself again to renew the onset, he began to kiss and caress\nme, when now making as if I just waked, I complained of the disturbance,\nand of the cruel pain that this little rest had stole my senses from.\nEager, however, for the pleasure, as well of consummating an entire\ntriumph over my virginity, he said every thing that could overcome my\nresistance, and bribe my patience to the end, which now I was ready to\nlisten to, from being secure of the bloody proofs I had prepared of his\nvictorious violence, though I still thought it good policy not to let\nhim in yet a while. I answered then only to his importunities in sighs\nand moans, \"that I was so hurt, I could not bear it... I was sure he\nhad done me a mischief; that he had... he was such a bad man!\" At this,\nturning down the clothes, and viewing the field of battle by the glimmer\nof a dying taper, he saw plainly my thighs, shift, and sheet, all\nstained with what he readily took for a virgin effusion, proceeding from\nhis last half penetration: convinced, and transported at which, nothing\ncould equal his joy and exultation. The illusion was complete, no other\nconception entered his head, but that of his having been at work upon an\nunopened mine; which idea, upon so strong an evidence, redoubled at once\nhis tenderness for me, and his ardour for breaking it wholly up. Kissing\nme then with the utmost rapture, he comforted me, and begged my pardon\nfor the pain he had put me to: observing withal, that it was only a\nthing in course; but the worst was certainly past, and that with a\nlittle courage and constancy, I should get it once well over, and never\nafter experience any thing but the greatest pleasure. By little and\nlittle I suffered myself to be prevailed on, and giving, as it were, up\nto the point of him, I made my thighs, insensibly spreading them, yield\nhim liberty of access, which improving, he got a little within me, when\nby a well managed reception I worked the female screw so nicely, that I\nkept him from the easy mid-channel direction, and by dexterous wreathing\nand contortions, creating an artificial difficulty of entrance, made him\nwin it inch by inch, with the most laborious struggles, I all the while\nsorely complaining: till at length, with might and main, winding his way\nin, he got it completely home, and giving my virginity, as he thought,\nthe coup le grace, furnished me with the cue of setting up a terrible\noutcry, whilst he, triumphant and like a cock clapping his wings over\nhis down-trod mistress, pursued his pleasure: which presently rose, in\nvirtue of this idea of a complete victory, to a pitch that made me\nsoon sensible of his melting period; whilst I now lay acting the deep\nwounded, breathless, frightened, undone, no longer maid.\n\nYou would ask me, perhaps, whether all this time I enjoyed any\nperception of pleasure? I assure you, little or none, till just towards\nthe latter end, a faintish sense of it came on mechanically, from so\nlong a struggle and frequent fret in that ever sensible part; but,\nin the first place, I had no taste for the person I was suffering the\nembraces of, on a pure mercenary account; and then, I was not entirely\ndelighted with myself for the jade's part I was playing, whatever\nexcuses I might plead for my being brought into it; but then this\ninsensibility kept me so much the mistress of my mind and motions, that\nI could the better manage so close a counterfeit, through the whole\nscene of deception.\n\nRecovered at length to a more shew of life, by his tender condolences,\nkisses and embraces, I upbraided him, and reproached him with my ruin,\nin such natural terms, as added to his satisfaction with himself, for\nhaving accomplished it; and guessing, by certain observations of mine,\nthat it would be rather favourable to him, to spare him, when he some\ntime after, feebly enough, came on again to the assault, I resolutely\nwithstood any further endeavours, on a pretext that flattered his\nprowess, of my being so violently hurt and sore, that I could not\npossibly endure a fresh trial. He then graciously granted me a respite,\nand the next morning soon after advancing, I got rid of further\nimportunity, till Mrs. Cole, being rung for by him, came in and was made\nacquainted, in terms of the utmost joy and rapture, with his triumphant\ncertainty of my virtue, and the finishing stroke he had given it, in the\ncourse of the night: of which, he added, she would see proof enough in\nbloody characters, on the sheets.\n\nYou may guess how a woman of her turn of address and experience humoured\nthe jest, and played him off with mixed exclamations of shame, danger,\ncompassion for me, and of her being pleased that all was so well over:\nin which last, I believe, she was certainly sincere. And now, as the\nobjection which she had represented as an invincible one, to me lying\nthe first night at his lodgings (which were studiously calculated for\nfreedom of intrigues), on the account of my maiden fears and terrors, at\nthe thought of going to a gentleman's chambers, and being alone with him\nin bed, was surmounted, she pretended to persuade me, in favour to him,\nthat I should go there to him, whenever he pleased, and still keep up\nall the necessary appearances of working with her, that I might not\nlose, with my character, the prospect of getting a good husband, and\nat the same time her house would be kept safer from scandal. All this\nseemed so reasonable, so considerate to Mr. Norbert, that he never once\nperceived that she did not want him to resort to her house, lest he\nmight in time discover certain inconsistencies with the character she\nhad set out with to him: besides that this plan greatly flattered his\nown ease, and views of liberty.\n\nLeaving me then to my much wanted rest, he got up, and Mrs. Cole, after\nsettling with him all points relating to me, got him undiscovered out\nof the house. After which, as I was awake, she came in, and gave me\ndue praises for my success. Behaving too with her usual moderation and\ndisinterestedness, she refused any share of the sum I had thus earned,\nand put me into such a secure and easy way of disposing of my affairs,\nwhich now amounted to a kind of little fortune, that a child of ten\nyears old might have kept the account and property of them safe in its\nhands.\n\nI was now restored again to my former state of a kept mistress, and used\npunctually to wait on Mr. Norbert at his chambers whenever he sent a\nmessenger for me, which I constantly took care to be in the way of, and\nmanaged with so much caution, that he never once penetrated the nature\nof my connections with Mrs. Cole; but indolently given up to ease and\nthe town dissipations, the perpetual hurry of them hindered him from\nlooking into his own affairs, much less to mine.\n\nIn the mean time, if I may judge from my own experience, none are better\npaid, or better treated, during their reign, than the mistress of those\nwho, enervate by nature, debaucheries, or age, have the least employment\nfor the sex: sensible that a woman must be satisfied some way, they\nply her with a thousand little tender attentions, presents, caresses,\nconfidences, and exhaust their inventions in means and devices to make\nup for the capital deficiency; and even towards lessening that, what\narts, what modes, what refinements of pleasure have they not recourse\nto, to raise their languid powers, and press nature into the service of\ntheir sensuality? But here is their misfortune, that when by a course of\nteasing, worrying, handling, wanton postures, lascivious motions, they\nhave at length accomplished a flashy enervate enjoyment, they at the\nsame time light up a flame in the object of their passion, that, not\nhaving the means themselves to quench, drives her for relief into the\nnext person's arms, who can finish their work; and thus they become\nbawds to some favourite, tried and approved of, for a more vigorous and\nsatisfactory execution; for with women, of our turn especially, however\nwell our hearts may be disposed, there is a controlling part, or\nqueen-seat in us, that governs itself by its own maxims of state,\namongst which not one is stronger, in practice with it, than, in the\nmatter of is dues, never to accept the will for the deed.\n\nMr. Norbert, who was much in this ungracious case, though he professed\nto like me extremely, could but seldom consummate the main-joy itself\nwith me, without such a length and variety of preparations, as were at\nonce wearisome and inflammatory.\n\nSometimes he would strip me stark naked on a carpet, by a good fire,\nwhen he would contemplate me almost by the hour, disposing me in all the\nfigures and attitudes of body that it was susceptible of being viewed in;\nkissing me in every part, the most secret and critical one so far\nfrom excepted that it received most of that branch of homage. Then\nhis touches were so exquisitely wanton, so luxuriously diffused\nand penetrative at times, that he had made me perfectly rage with\ntitillating fires, when, after all, and much ado, he had gained a\nshort-lived erection, he would perhaps melt it away in a washy sweat, or\na premature abortive effusion, that provokingly mocked my eager desires:\nor, if carried home, how faultered and unnervous the execution! how\ninsufficient the sprinkle of a few heat-drops to extinguish all the\nflames he had kindled!\n\nOne evening, I cannot help remembering, that returning home from him,\nwith a spirit he had raised in a circle his wand had proved too weak\nto lay, as I turned the corner of a street, I was overtaken by a young\nsailor, I was then in that spruce, neat, plain dress, which I\never affected and perhaps might have, in my trip, a certain air of\nrestlessness unknown to the composure of cooler thoughts. However, he\nseized me as a prize, and without farther ceremony threw his arms round\nmy neck, and kissed me boisterously and sweetly. I looked at him with a\nbeginning of anger and indignation at his rudeness, that softened away\ninto other sentiments as I viewed him: for he was tall, manly carriaged,\nhandsome of body and face, so that I ended my stare, with asking him,\nin a tone turned to tenderness, what he meant; at which, with the same\nfrankness and vivacity as he had begun with me, he proposed treating me\nwith a glass of wine. Now, certain it is, that had I been in a calmer\nstate of blood than I was, had I not been under the dominion of\nunappeased irritation; but I do not know how it was, my pressing calls,\nhis figure, the occasion, and if you will, the powerful combination of\nall these, with a start of curiosity to see the end of an adventure, so\nnovel too as being treated like a common street-plyer, made me give\na silent consent; in short, it was not my head that I now obeyed, I\nsuffered myself to be towed along as it were by this man-of-war,\nwho took me under his arm as familialry as if he had known me all his\nlifetime, and led me into the next convenient tavern, where we were\nshown into a little room on one side of the passage. Here, scarce\nallowing himself patient till the drawer brought in the wine called\nfor, he fell directly on board me: when, untucking my handkerchief, and\ngiving me a snatching buss, he laid my breasts bare at once, which he\nhandled with that keenness of gust that abridges a ceremonial evermore\ntiresome than pleasing on such pressing occasions; and now, hurrying\ntowards the main point, we found no conveniency to our purpose, two\nor three disabled chairs, and a rickety table, composing the whole\nfurniture of the room. Without more ado, he plans me with my back\nstanding against the wall, and my petticoats up; and coming out with\na splitter indeed, made it shine, as he brandished it, in my eyes; and\ngoing to work with an impetuosity and eagerness, bred very likely by\na long fast at seat, went to give me a taste of it. I straddled, I\nhumoured my posture, and did my best in short to buckle to it; I took\npart of it in, but still things did not go to his thorough liking;\nchanging them in a trice his system of battery, he leads me to the table\nand with a master-hand lays my head down on the edge of it, and, with\nthe other canting up my petticoats and shift, bares my naked posteriors\nto his blind and furious guide; it forces its way between them, and I\nfeeling pretty sensibly that it was not going by the right door, and\nknocking desperately at the wrong one, I told him of it:--\"Pooh!\" says\nhe, \"my dear, any port in a storm.\" Altering, however, directly his\ncourse, and lowering his point, he fixed it right, and driving it up\nwith a delicious stiffness, made all foam again, and gave me the tout\nwith such fire and spirit, that in the fine disposition I was in when I\nsubmitted to him and stirred up so fiercely as I was, I got the start of\nhim, and went away into the melting swoon, and squeezing him, whilst in\nthe convulsive grasp of it, drew from him such a plenteous bedewal, as\npointed to my own effusion, perfectly floated those parts, and drowned\nin a deluge all my raging conflagration of desire.\n\nWhen this was over, how to make my retreat was my concern; for, though\nI had been so extremely pleased with the difficult between this warm\nbroadside, poured so briskly into me, and the tiresome pawing and toying\nto which I had owed the unappeased flames that had driven me into this\nstep, now I was cooler, I began to apprehend the danger of contracting\nan acquaintance with this, however agreeable stranger; who, on his side,\nspoke of passing the evening with me and continuing our intimacy, with\nan air of determination that made me afraid of its being not so easy\nto get away from him as I could wish. In the mean time I carefully\nconcealed my uneasiness, and readily pretended to consent to stay with\nhim, telling him I should only step to my lodgings to leave a necessary\ndirection, and then instantly return. This he very glibly swallowed, on\nthe notion of my being one of those unhappy street-errants, who devote\nthemselves to the pleasure of the first ruffian that will stoop to pick\nthem up, and of course, that I would scarce bilk myself of the hire,\nby not returning make the most of the job. Thus he parted with me, not\nbefore, however, he had ordered in my hearing a supper, which I had the\nbarbarity to disappoint him of my company too.\n\nBut when I got home, and told Mrs. Cole my adventure, she represented\nso strongly to me the nature and dangerous consequences of my folly,\nparticularly the risks to my health, in being so openlegged and free,\nthat I not only took resolutions never to venture so rashly again,\nwhich I inviolably preserved, but passed a good many days in continual\nuneasiness, lest I should have met with other reasons, besides the\npleasure of that rencounter, to remember it; but these fears wronged my\npretty sailor, for which I gladly make him this reparation.\n\nI had now lived with Mr. Norbert near a quarter of a year, in which\nspace I circulated my time very pleasantly, between my amusements at\nMrs. Cole's, and a proper attendance on that gentleman, who paid me\nprofusely for the unlimited complaisance with which I passively humoured\nevery caprice of pleasure, and which had won upon him so greatly, that\nfinding, as he said, all that variety in me alone, which he had sought\nfor in a number of women, I had made him lose his taste for inconstancy,\nand new faces. But what was yet at least agreeable, as well as more\nnattering, the love I had inspired him with, bred a deference to me,\nthat was of great service to his health: for having by degrees, and with\nmuch pathetic representations brought him to some husbandry of it, and\nto insure the duration of his pleasures by moderating their use, and\ncorrecting those excesses in them he was so addicted to, and which had\nshattered his constitution and destroyed his powers of life in the very\npoint for which he seemed desirous to live, he was grown more delicate,\nmore temperate, and in course more healthy; his gratitude for which was\ntaking a turn very favourable for my fortune, when once more the caprice\nof it dashed the cup from my lips.\n\nHis sister, lady L..., for whom he had a great affection, desiring him\nto accompany her down to Bath for her health, he could not refuse her\nsuch a favour; and accordingly, though he counted on staying away from\nme no more than a week at farthest, he took his leave of me with an\nominous heaviness of heart, and left me a sum far above the state of\nhis fortune, and very inconsistent with the intended shortness of his\njourney; but it ended in the longest that can be, and is never but once\ntaken: for, arrived at Bath, he was not there two days before he fell\ninto a debauch of drinking with some gentlemen, that threw him into a\nhigh fever, and carried him off in four days' time, never once out of\na delirium. Had he been in his senses to make a will, perhaps he might\nhave made favourable mention of me in it. Thus, however, I lost him; and\nas no condition of life is more subject to revolutions than that of\na woman of pleasure, I soon recovered my cheerfulness, and now beheld\nmyself once more struck off the list of kept mistresses, and returned\ninto the bosom of the community, from which I had been in some manner\ntaken.\n\nMrs. Cole still continued her friendship, and offered me her assistance\nand advice towards another choice; but I was now in ease and affluence\nenough to look about me at leisure; and as to any constitutional calls\nof pleasure, their pressure, or sensibility, was greatly lessened by a\nconsciousness of the east with which they were to be satisfied at Mrs.\nCole's house, where Louisa and Emily still continued in the old way; and\nmy great favourite Harriet used often to come and see me, and entertain\nme, with her head and heart full of the happiness she enjoyed with\nher dear baronet, whom she loved with a tenderness and constancy,\neven though he was her keeper, and what is yet more, had made her\nindependent, by a handsome provision for her and hers. I was then in\nthis vacancy from any regular employ of my person in my way of business,\nwhen one day, Mrs. Cole, in the course of the constant confidence we\nlived in, acquainted me that there was one Mr. Barville, who used her\nhouse, just come to town, whom she was not a little perplexed about\nproviding a suitable companion for; which was indeed a point of\ndifficulty, as he was under the tyranny of a cruel taste: that of an\nardent desire, not only of being unmercifully whipped himself, but of\nwhipping others, in such sort, that though he paid extravagantly those\nwho had the courage and complaisance to submit to his humour, there\nwere few, delicate as he was in the choice of his subjects, who would\nexchange turns with him so terribly at the expense of their skin. But,\nwhat yet increased the oddity of this strange fancy was the gentleman\nbeing young; whereas it generally attacks, it seems, such as are,\nthrough age, obliged to have recourse to this experiment, for quickening\nthe circulation of their sluggish juices, and determining a conflux of\nthe spirits of pleasure towards those flagging shrivelly parts, that\nrise to life only by virtue of those titillating ardours created by\nthe discipline of their opposites, with which they have so surprising a\nconsent.\n\nThis Mrs. Cole could not well acquaint me with, in any expectation of\nmy offering for service: for, sufficiently easy as I was in my\ncircumstances, it must have been the temptation of an immense interest\nindeed, that could have induced me to embrace such a job, neither had I\never expressed, nor indeed, felt the least impulse or curiosity to know\nmore of a taste, that promised so much more pain than pleasure to those\nthat stood in no need of such violent goads: what then should move me\nto subscribe myself voluntarily to a party of pain, foreknowing it such?\nWhy, to tell the plain truth, it was a sudden caprice, a gust of fancy\nfor trying a new experiment, mixed with the vanity of approving my\npersonal courage to Mrs. Cole, that determined me, at all risks,\nto propose myself to her and relieve her from any farther lookout.\nAccordingly, I at once pleased and surprised her, with a frank and\nunreserved tender of my person to her and her friend's absolute disposal\non this occasion.\n\nMy good temporal mother was, however, so kind as to use all the\narguments she could imagine to dissuade me: but, as I found they only\nturned on a motive of tenderness to me, I persisted in my resolution,\nand thereby acquitted my offer of any suspicion of its not having been\nsincerely made, or out of compliment only. Acquiescing then thankfully\nin it, Mrs. Cole assured me \"that bating the pain I should be put to,\nshe had no scruple to engage me to this party, which she assured me I\nshould be liberally paid for, and which, the secrecy of the transaction\npreserved safe from the ridicule that otherwise vulgarly attended it;\nthat for her part, she considered pleasure, of one sort or other, as the\nuniversal port of destination, and every wind that blew thither a good\none, provided it blew nobody any harm; that she rather compassionated,\nthan blamed those unhappy persons, who are under a subjection they\ncannot shake off, to those arbitrary tastes that rule their appetites\nof pleasures with an unaccountable control: tastes too, as infinitely\ndiversified, as superior to, and independent of all reasoning as the\ndifferent relishes or palates of mankind in their viands, some\ndelicate stomach nauseating plain meats, and finding no savour but in\nhighseasoned, luxurious dishes, whilst others again pique themselves\nupon detesting them.\"\n\nI stood now in no need of this preamble of encouragement, or\njustification: my word was given, and I was determined to fulfill my\nengagements. Accordingly the night was set, and I had all the necessary\nprevious instructions how to act and conduct myself. The dining room was\nduly prepared and lighted up, and the young; gentleman posted there in\nwaiting, for my introduction to him.\n\nI was then, by Mrs. Cole, brought in, and presented to him, in a loose\ndishabille fitted, by her direction, to the exercise I was to go\nthrough, all in the finest linen and a thorough white uniform:\ngown, petticoat, stocking, and satin slippers, like a victim led to\nsacrifice; whilst my dark auburn hair, falling in drop-curls over my\nneck, created a pleasing distinction of colour from the rest of my\ndress.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Barville saw me, he got up, with a visible air of\npleasure and surprise, and saluting me, asked Mrs. Cole, if so fine\nand delicate a creature would voluntarily submit to such sufferings\nand rigours, as were the subject of his assignation. She answered him\nproperly, and now, reading in his eyes that she could not too soon leave\nus together, she went out, after recommending to him to use moderation\nwith so tender a novice.\n\nBut whilst she was employing his attention, mine had been taken up with\nexamining the figure and person of this unhappy young gentleman, who was\nthus unaccountably condemned to have his pleasure lashed into him, as\nboys have their learning.\n\nHe was exceedingly fair, and, smooth complexioned, and appeared to me no\nmore than twenty at most, though he was three years older than what\nmy conjectures gave him; but then he owed this favourable mistake to\na habit of fatness, which spread through a short, squab stature; and\na round, plump, fresh coloured face gave him greatly the look of\na Bacchus, had not an air of austerity, not to say sternness, very\nunsuitable even to his shape of face, dashed that character of joy,\nnecessary to complete the resemblance. His dress was extremely neat, but\nplain, and far inferior to the ample fortune he was in full possession\nof; this too was a taste in him, and not avarice.\n\nAs soon as Mrs. Cole was gone, he seated me near him, when now his face\nchanged upon me, into an expression of the most pleasing sweetness and\ngood humour, the most remarkable for its sudden shift from the other\nextreme, which I found afterwards, when I knew more of his character,\nwas owing to a habitual state of conflict with, and dislike of\nhimself, for being enslaved to so peculiar a lust, by the fatality of a\nconstitutional ascendant, that rendered him incapable of receiving any\npleasure, till he submitted to these extraordinary means of procuring\nit at the hands of pain, whilst the constancy of this repining\nconsciousness stamped at length that cast of sourness and severity on\nhis features: which was, in fact, very foreign to the natural sweetness\nof his temper.\n\nAfter a competent preparation by apologies, and encouragement to go\nthrough my part with spirit and constancy, he stood up near the fire,\nwhilst I went to fetch the instruments of discipline out of a closet\nhard by: these were several rods, made each of two or three strong twigs\nof birch tied together, which he took, handled, and viewed with as much\npleasure, as I did with a kind of shuddering presage.\n\nNext we took from the side of the room a long broad bench, made easy to\nlie at length on by a soft cushion in a callico-cover; and everything\nbeing now ready, he took his coat and waistcoat off; and at his motion\nand desire, I unbuttoned his breeches, and rolling up his shirt rather\nabove his waist, tucked it on securely there; when directing naturally\nmy eyes to that humoursone master-movement, in whose favaur all these\ndispositions were making, it seemed almost shrunk into his body, scarce\nshowing its tip above the sprout of hairy curls that clothed those\nparts, as you may have-seen a wren peeping its head out of the grass.\n\nStooping them to untie his garters, he gave them to me for the use\nof tying him down to the legs of the bench: a circumstance no farther\nnecessary than, as I suppose, it made part of the humour of the thing,\nsince he prescribed it to himself, amongst the rest of the ceremonial.\n\nI led him then to the bench, and according to my cue, played at forcing\nhim to lie down: which, after-some little show of reluctance, for\nform-sake, he submitted to; he was straightway extended flat upon his:\nbelly, on the bench, with a pillow under his face; and as he thus tamely\nlay, I tied him slightly hand and feet, to the legs of it; which done,\nhis shirt remaining-trussed up over the small of his back, I drew his\nbreeches quite down to his knees; and now he lay, in all the fairest,\nbroadest display of that part of the back-view; in which a pair of\nchubby, smooth-cheeked and passing white posteriors rose cushioning\nupwards from two stout, fleshful thighs, and ending their cleft, or\nseparation by an union at the small of the back, presented a bold mark,\nthat swelled, as it were, to meet the scourge.\n\nSeizing now one of the rods, I stood over him, and according to his\ndirection, gave him in one breath, ten lashes with much good-will, and\nthe utmost nerve and vigour of arm that I could put to them, so as to\nmake those fleshy orbs quiver again under them; whilst he himself seemed\nno more concerned, or to mind them, than a lobster would a flea-bite. In\nthe mean time, I view intently the effect of them, which to me at last\nappeared surprisingly cruel: every lash had skimmed the surface of those\nwhite cliffs, which they deeply reddened, and lapping round the side\nof the furthermost from me, cut specially, into the dimple of it, such\nlivid weals, as the blood either spun out from, or stood in large drops\non; and, from some of the cuts, I picked out even the splinters of the\nrod that had stuck in the skin. Nor was this raw work to be wondered\nat, considering the greenness of the twigs and the severity of the\ninfliction, whilst the whole surface of the skin was so smooth-stretched\nover the hard and firm pulp of flesh that filled it, as to yield no\nplay, or elusive swagging under the stroke: which thereby took place the\nmore plump, and cut into the quick.\n\nI was however already so moved at the piteous sight, that I from my\nheart repented the undertaking, and would willing had given over,\nthinking he had full enough; but, he encouraging and beseeching me\nearnestly to proceed, I gave him ten more lashes; and then resting,\nsurveyed the increase of bloody appearances. And at length, steeled to\nthe height, by his stoutness in suffering, I continued the discipline,\nby intervals, till I observed him wreathing and twisting his body, in\na way that I could plainly perceive was not the effect of pain, but of\nsome new and powerful sensation: curious to dive into the meaning of\nwhich, in one of my pauses of intermission, I approached, as he still\nkept working, and grinding his belly against the cushion under him: and\nfirst stroking the untouched and unhurt side of the flesh-mount next me,\nthen softly insinuating my hand under his thigh, felt the posture things\nwere in forwards, which was indeed surprising: for that machine of him,\nwhich I had, by its appearance, taken for an impalpable, or at least a\nvery diminutive subject, was now, in virtue of all that smart and\nhavoc of his skin behind, grown not only to a prodigious stiffness of\nerection, but to a size that frighted even me: a non-pareil thickness\nindeed! the head of it alone filled the utmost capacity of my grasp.\nAnd when, as he heaved and wriggled to and fro, in the agitation of his\nstrange pleasure, it came into view, it had something of the air of a\nround fillet of veal, and like its owner, squab, and short in proportion\nto its breadth; but when he felt my hand there, he begged I would go on\nbriskly with my jerking, or he should never arrive at the last stage of\npleasure.\n\nResuming then the rode and the exercise of it, I had fairly worn out\nthree bundles, when, after an increase of struggles and motion, and a\ndeep sigh or two, I saw him lie still and motionless; and now he desired\nme to desist, which I instantly did; and proceeding to untie him, I\ncould not but be amazed at his passive fortitude, on viewing the skin of\nhis butchered, mangled posteriors, late so white, smooth and polished,\nnow all one side of them a confused cut-work of weals, livid flesh,\ngashes and gore, insomuch that when he stood up, he could scarce walk;\nin short, he was in sweet-briars.\n\nThen I plainly perceived, on the cushion, the marks of a plenteous\neffusion, and already had his sluggard member run up to its old\nnestling-place, and enforced itself again, as if ashamed to shew its\nhead; which nothing, it seems, could raise but stripes inflicted on its\nopposite neighbours, who were thus constantly obliged to suffer for his\ncaprice.\n\nMy gentleman had now put on his clothes and recomposed himself, when\ngiving me a kiss, and placing me by him, he sat himself down as gingerly\nas possible, with one side off the cushion, which was too sore for him\nto bear resting any part of his weight on.\n\nHere he thanked me for the extreme pleasure I had procured him, and\nseeing, perhaps, some marks in my countenance of terror and apprehension\nof retaliation on my own skin, for what I had been the instrument of\nhis suffering in his, he assured me, \"he was ready to give up to me any\nengagement I might deem myself under to stand him, as he had done me,\nbut that if I proceeding in my consent to it, he would consider the\ndifference of my sex, its greater delicacy and incapacity to undergo\npain.\" Reheartened at which, and piqued in honour, as I thought, not\nto flinch so near the trial, especially as I well knew Mrs. Cole was an\neye-witness, from her stand of espial, to the whole of our transaction,\nI was now less afraid of my skin, than of his not furnishing me with an\nopportunity of signalizing my resolution.\n\nConsonant to this disposition was my answer, but my courage was still\nmore in my head, than in my heart; and as cowards rush into danger they\nfear, in order to be the sooner rid of the pain of that sensation, I\nwas entirely pleased with his hastening matters into execution.\n\nHe had then little to do, but to unloose the strings of my petticoats,\nand lift them, together with my shift, navel-high, where he just tucked\nthem up loosely, and might be slipt up higher at pleasure. Then viewing\nme round with great seeming delight, he laid me at length on my face\nupon the bench, and when I expected he would tie me, as I had done him,\nand held out my hands, not without fear and a little trembling, he\ntold me, \"he would by no means terrify me unnecessarily with such a\nconfinement; for that though he meant to put my constancy to a trial,\nthe standing it was to be completely voluntary on my side, and therefore\nI might be at full liberty to get up whenever I found the pain too much\nfor me.\" You cannot imagine how much I thought myself bound, by being\nthus allowed to remain loose, and how much spirit this confidence in\nme gave me, so that I was even from my heart careless how much my flesh\nmight suffer in honour of it.\n\nAll my back parts, naked half way up, were now fully at his mercy: and\nfirst, he stood at a convenient distance, delighting himself with a\ngloating survey of the attitude I lay in, and of all the secret stores I\nthus exposed to him in fair display. Then, springing eagerly towards me,\nhe covered all those naked parts with a fond profusion of kisses;\nand now, taking hold of the rod, rather wantoned with me, in gentle\ninflictions on those tender trembling masses of my flesh behind, than in\nany way hurt them, till by degrees, he began to tingle them with smarter\nlashes, so as to provoke a red colour into them, which I knew, as\nwell by the flagrant glow I felt there, as by his telling me, they now\nemulated the native roses of my other cheeks. When he had thus amused\nhimself with admiring, and toying with them, he went on to strike\nharder, and more hard, so that I needed all my patience not to cry out,\nor complain at least. At last, he twigged me so smartly as to fetch\nblood in more than one lash: at sight of which he flung down the rod,\nflew to me, kissed away the starting drops, and sucking the wounds eased\na good deal of my pain. But now raising me on my knees, and making me\nkneel with them straddling wide, that tender part of me, naturally the\nprovince of pleasure, not of pain, came in for its share of suffering:\nfor now, eyeing it wistfully, he directed the rod so that the sharp ends\nof the twigs lighted there, so sensibly, that I could not help wincing,\nand writhing my limbs with smart; so that my contortions of body must\nnecessarily throw it into infinite variety of postures and points of\nview, fit to feast the luxury of the eye. But still I bore every thing\nwithout crying out: when presently giving me another pause, he rushed,\nas it were, on that part whose lips, and round about, had felt this\ncruelty, and by way of reparation, glued his own to them; then he\nopened, shut, squeezed them, plucked softly the overgrowing moss, and\nall this in a style of wild passionate rapture and enthusiasm, that\nexpressed excess of pleasure; till betaking himself to the rod again,\nencouraged by my passiveness, and infuriated with this strange taste of\ndelight, he made my poor posteriors pay for the ungovernableness of it;\nfor now showing them no quarter, the traitor cut me so, that I wanted\nbut little of fainting away, when he gave over. And yet I did not utter\none groan, or angry expostulation; but in my heart I resolved nothing so\nseriously, as never to expose myself again to the like severities.\n\nYou may guess then in what a curious pickle those soft flesh-cushions of\nmine were, all so red, raw, and in fine, terribly clawed off; but so far\nfrom feeling any pleasure in it, that the recent smart made me pout\na little, and not with the greatest air of satisfaction receive the\ncompliments, and after-caresses of the author of my pain.\n\nAs soon as my clothes were huddled on in a little decency, a supper was\nbrought in by the discreet Mrs. Cole herself, which might have piqued\nthe sensuality of a cardinal, accompanied with a choice of the richest\nwines: all which she set before us, and went out again, without having,\nby a word or even by a smile, given us the least interruption or\nconfusion, in those moments of secrecy, that we were not yet ripe to the\nadmission of a third too.\n\nI sat down then, still scarce in charity with my butcher, for such I\ncould not help considering him, and was moreover not a little piqued\nat the gay, satisfied air of his countenance, which I thought myself\ninsulted by. But when the now necessary refreshment to me of a glass of\nwine, and a little eating (all the time observing a profound silence)\nhad somewhat cheered and restored me to spirits, and as the smart began\nto go off, my good humour returned accordingly: which alteration not\nescaping him, he said and did every thing that could confirm me in, and\nindeed exalt it.\n\nBut scarce was supper well over, before a change so incredible was\nwrought in me, such violent, yet pleasingly irksome sensations took\npossession of me that I scarce knew how to contain myself; the smart\nof the lashes was now converted into such a prickly heat, such fiery\ntinglings, as made me sigh, squeeze my thighs together, shift and\nwriggle about my seat, with a furious restlessness; whilst these itching\nardours, thus excited in those parts on which the storm of discipline\nhad principally fallen, detached legions of burning, subtile,\nstimulating spirits, to their opposite spot and centre of assemblage,\nwhere their titillation raged so furiously, that I was even stinging\nmade with them. No wonder then that in such a taking, and devoured by\nflames that licked up all modesty and reserve, my eyes, now charged\nbrimful of the most intense desire, fired on my companion very\nintelligible signal of distress: my companion, I say, who grew in them\nevery instant more amiable, and more necessary to my urgent wishes and\nhopes of immediate ease.\n\nMr. Barville, no stranger, by experience, to these situations, soon knew\nthe pass I was brought to soon perceived my extreme disorder; in favour\nof which, removing the table out of the way, he began a prelude that\nflattered me with instant relief, to which I was not, however, so near\nas I imagined: for as he was unbuttoned to me, and tried to provoke and\nrouse to action his unactive torpid machine, he blushingly owned that no\ngood was to be expected from it, unless I took it in hand to re-excite\nits languid loitering powers, by just refreshing the smart of the yet\nrecent blood-raw cuts, seeing it could, no more than a boy's top, keep\nup without lashing. Sensible then that I should work as much for my own\nprofit as his, I hurried my compliance with his desire, and abridging\nthe ceremonial, whilst he leaned his head against the back of a chair, I\nhad scarce gently made him feel the lash, before I saw the object of my\nwishes give signs of life, and presently, as it were with a magic touch,\nis started up into a noble size and distinction indeed. Hastening then\nto give me the benefit of it, he threw me down on the bench; but such\nwas the refreshed soreness of those parts behind, on my leaning so hard\non them, as became me to compass the admission of that stupendous head\nof his machine, that I could not possibly bear it. I got up then, and\ntried, by leaning forwards, and turning the crupper on my assailant, to\nlet him at the back avenue: but here it was likewise impossible to stand\nhis bearing so fiercely against me, in his agitations and endeavours to\nenter that way, whilst his belly battered directly against the recent\nsore. What should we do now? both intolerably heated: both in a fury;\nbut pleasure is ever inventive for its own ends: he strips me in a trice\nstark naked, and placing a broad settee-cushion on the carpet before the\nfire, oversets me gently, topsy turvy, on it; and handling me only\nat the waist, whilst you may be sure I favoured all my dispositions,\nbrought my legs round his neck; so that my head was kept from the floor\nonly by my hands and the velvet cushion, which was now bespread with\nmy flowing hair: thus I stood on my head and hands, supported by him in\nsuch manner, that whilst my thighs clung round him, so as to expose\nto his sight all my back figure, including the theatre of his bloody\npleasure, the centre of my fore pair fairly bearded the ob-jest of its\nrage, that now stood in fine condition to give me satisfaction for the\ninjuries of its neighbours. But as this posture was certainly not the\neasiest, and our imaginations, wound up to the height, could suffer no\ndelay, he first, with the utmost eagerness and effort, just lip-lodged\nthat broad acorn-fashioned head of his instrument; and still befriended\nby the fury with which he had made that impression, he soon stuffed\nin the rest; when now, with a pursuit of thrusts, fiercely urged, he\nabsolutely overpowered and absorbed all sense of pain and uneasiness,\nwhether from my wounds behind, my most untoward posture, or the oversize\nof his stretcher, in an infinitely predominant delight; when now all\nmy whole spirits of life and sensation rushing, impetuously to\nthe cock-pit, where the prize of pleasure was hotly in dispute and\nclustering to a point there, I soon received the dear relief of nature\nfrom these over-violent strains and provocations of it; harmonizing with\nwhich, my gallant spouted into me such a potent overflow of the balsamic\ninjection, as softened and unedged all those irritating stings of a new\nspecies of titillation, which I had been so intolerably maddened with,\nand restored the ferment of my senses to some degree of composure.\n\nI had now achieved this rare adventure ultimately much more to my\nsatisfaction than I had bespoken the nature of it to turn out; nor\nwas it much lessened, you may think, by spark's lavish praises of my\nconstancy and complaisance, which he gave weight to by a present that\ngreatly surpassed my utmost expectation, besides his gratification to\nMrs. Cole.\n\nI was not, however, at any time re-enticed to renew with him, or resort\nagain to the violent expedient of lashing nature into more haste than\ngood speed: which, by the way, I conceive acts somewhat in the manner\nof a dose of Spanish flies; with more pain perhaps, but less danger;\nand might be necessary to him, but was nothing less so than to me, whose\nappetite wanted the bridle more than the spur.\n\nMrs. Cole, to whom this adventurous exploit had more and more endeared\nme, looked on me now as a girl after her own heart, afraid of nothing,\nand, on a good account, hardly enough to fight all the weapons of\npleasure through. Attentive then, in consequence of these favourable\nconceptions, to promote either my profit or pleasure, she had special\nregard for the first, in a new gallant of a very singular turn, that she\nprocured for and introduced to me.\n\nThis was a grave staid, solemn, elderly gentleman, whose peculiar humour\nwas a delight in combing fine tresses of hair; and as I was perfectly\nheaded to his taste, he used to come constantly at my toilet hours, when\nI let down my hair as loose as nature, and abandoned it to him to do\nwhat he pleased with it; and accordingly he would keep me an hour or\nmore in play with it, drawing the comb through it, winding the curls\nround his fingers, even kissing it as he smoothed it; and all this led\nto no other use of my person, or any other liberties whatever, any more\nthan if a distinction of sexes had not existed.\n\nAnother peculiarity of taste he had, which was to present me with a\ndozen pairs of the whitest kid gloves at a time: these he would divert\nhimself with drawing on me, and then biting off their finger ends;\nall which fooleries of a silly appetite, the old gentleman paid more\nliberally for, than most others did for more essential favours. This\nlasted till a violent cough, seizing and laying him up, delivered me\nfrom this most innocent and insipid trifler, for I never heard more of\nhim after his first retreat.\n\nYou may be sure a by-jod of this sort interfered with no other pursuit,\nor plan of life; which I led, in truth, with a modesty and reserve\nthat was less the work of virtue than of exhausted novelty, a glut\nof pleasure, and easy circumstances, that made me indifferent to any\nengagements in which pleasure and profit were not eminently united; and\nsuch I could, with the less impatience, wait for at the hands of time\nand fortune, as I was satisfied I could never mend my pennyworths,\nhaving evidently been served at the top of the market, and even\nbeen pampered with dainties: besides that, in the sacrifice of a few\nmomentary impulses, I found a secret satisfaction in respecting myself,\nas well as preserving the life and freshness of my complexion. Louisa\nand Emily did not carry indeed their reserve so high as I did; but still\nthey were far from cheap or abandoned, though two of their adventures\nseemed to contradict this general character, which, for their\nsingularity, I shall give you in course, beginning first with Emily's:\n\nLouisa and she went one night to a ball, the first in the habit of a\nshepherdess, Emily in that of a shepherd: I saw them in their dresses\nbefore they went, and nothing in nature could represent a prettier\nboy than this last did, being so fair and well limbed. They had kept\ntogether for some time, when Louisa, meeting an old acquaintance of\nhers, very cordially gives her companion the slip, and leaves her\nunder the protection of her boy's habit, which was not much, and of\nher discretion, which was, it seems, still less. Emily, finding herself\ndeserted, sauntered thoughtless about a while, and, as much for coolness\nand air as any thing else, at length pulled off her mask and went to the\nsideboard; where, eyed and marked out by a gentleman in a very handsome\ndomino, she was accosted by, and fell into chat with him. The domino,\nafter a little discourse, in which Emily doubtless distinguished her\ngood nature and easiness more than her wit, began to make violent love\nto her, and drawing her insensibly to some benches at the lower end of\nthe masquerade room, got her to sit by him, where he squeezed her hands,\npinched her cheeks, praised and played with her fine hair, admired\nher complexion, and all in a style of courtship dashed with a certain\noddity, that not comprehending the mystery of, poor Emily attributed to\nhis falling in with the humour of her disguise; and being naturally not\nthe cruellest of her profession, began to incline to a parley on those\nessentials. But here was the stress of the joke: he took her really\nfor what she appeared to be, a smock-faced boy; and she, forgetting her\ndress, and of course ranging quite wide of his ideas, took all those\naddress to be paid to herself as a woman, which she precisely owed to\nhis not thinking her one. However, this double error was pushed to\nsuch a height on both sides, that Emily, who saw nothing in him but a\ngentleman of distinction by those points of dress to which his disguise\ndid not extend, warmed too by the wine he had plyed her with, and the\ncaresses he had lavished upon her, suffered herself to be persuaded to\ngo to a bagnio with him; and thus, losing sight of Mrs. Cole's cautions,\nwith a blind confidence, put herself into his hands, to be carried\nwherever he pleased. For his part, equally blinded by his wishes, whilst\nhere gregious simplicity favoured his deception more than the most\nexquisite art could have done, he supposed, no doubt, that he had\nlighted on some soft simpleton, fit for his; purpose, or some kept\nminion broken to his hand, who understood him perfectly well, and\nentered into his designs. But, be that as it would, he led her to\na coach, went into it with her, and brought her to a very handsome\napartment, with a bed in it; but whether it was a bagnio or not, she\ncould not tell, having spoken to nobody but himself. But when they were\nalone together, and her inamorato began to proceed to those extremities\nwhich instantly discover the sex, she remarked, that no description\ncould paint up to the life, the mixture of pique, confusion and\ndisappointment, that appeared in his countenance, joined to the mournful\nexclamation: \"By heavens, a woman!\" This at once opened her eyes, which\nhad been shut in downright stupidity. However, as if he had meant to\nretrieve that escape, he still continued to toy with and fondle her,\nbut with so staring an alteration from extreme warmth into a chill and\nforced civility, that even Emily herself could not but take notice\nof it, and now began to wish she had paid more regard to Mrs. Cole's\npremonitions against ever engaging with a stranger. And now an excess of\ntimidity succeeded to an excess of confidence, and she thought herself\nso much at his mercy and discretion, that she stood passive throughout\nthe whole progress of his prelude: for now, whether the impressions\nof so great a beauty had even made him forgive her sex, or whether her\nappearance or figure in that dress still humoured his first illusion, he\nrecovered by degrees a good part of his first warmth, and keeping Emily\nwith her breeches still unbuttoned, stript them down to her knees, and\ngently impelling her to lean down, with her face against the bed-side,\nplaced her so, that the double way, between the double rising behind,\npresented the choice fair to him, and he was so fairly set on a\nmis-direction, as to give the girl no small alarms for fear of losing\na maidenhead she had not dreamt of. However, her complaints, and a\nresistance, gentle, but firm, checked and brought him to himself again;\nso that turning his steed's head, he drove him at length in the right\nroad, in which his imagination having probably made the most of those\nresemblances that flattered his taste, he got, with much ado, to his\njourney's end: after which, he led her out himself, and walking with her\ntwo or three streets length, got her a chair, when making her a present\nnot any thing inferior to what she could have expected, he left her,\nwell recommended to the chairmen, who, on her directions, brought her\nhome.\n\nThis she related to Mrs. Cole and me the same morning, not without the\nvisible remains of the fear and confusion she had been in, still stamped\non her countenance. Mrs. Cole's remark was, that her indiscretion\nproceeding from a constitutional facility, there were little hopes of\nany thing curing her of it, but repeated severe experience. Mine was,\nthat I could not conceive how it was possible for mankind to run into\na taste, not only universally odious, but absurd, and impossible to\ngratify; since, according to the notions and experience I had of things,\nit was not in nature to force such immense disproportions. Mrs. Cole\nonly smiled at my ignorance, and said nothing towards my undeception,\nwhich was not affected but by ocular demonstration, some months after,\nwhich a most singular accident furnished me, and which I will here set\ndown, that I may not return again to so disagreeable a subject.\n\nI had, on a visit intended to Harriet, who had taken lodgings at\nHampton-court, hired a chariot to go out thither, Mrs. Cole having,\npromised to accompany me; but some indispensable business intervening,\nto detain her, I was obliged to set out alone; and scarce had I got a\nthird of my way, before the axle-tree broke down, and I was well off to\nget out, safe and unhurt, into a public-house, of a tolerable handsome\nappearance, on the road. Here the people told me that the stage would\ncome by in a couple of hours at farthest, upon; which, determining to\nwait for it, sooner than lose the jaunt I had got so far forward on, I\nwas carried into a very clean decent room, up one pair of stairs, which\nI took possession of for the time I had to stay, in right of calling for\nsufficient to do the house justice.\n\nHere, whilst I was amusing myself with looking out of the window, a\nsingle horse-chaise stopt at the door, out of which lightly leaped two\nyoung' gentlemen, for so they seemed, who came in only as it were to\nbait and refresh a little, for they gave their horse to be held! in\nreadiness against they came out. And presently I heard the door of the\nnext room, where they were let in, and called about them briskly; and as\nsoon as they were served, I could just hear that they shut and fastened\nthe door on the inside.\n\nA spirit of curiosity, far from sudden, since I do not know when I was\nwithout it, prompted me, without any particular suspicion, or other\ndrift or view, to see what they were, and examine their persons and\nbehaviour. The partition of our rooms was one of those moveable ones\nthat, when taken down, served occasionally to lay them into one, for the\nconveniency of as larger company; and now, my nicest search could not\nshew me the shadow of a peep-hole, a circumstance which probably had not\nescaped the review of the parties on the other side, whom much it stood\nupon not to be deceived in it; but at length I observed a paper patch of\nthe same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but\nthen it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach\nit, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon\npierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying\nmy eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two\nyoung sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my\nimagination, in frolic and innocent play.\n\nThe eldes might be, on my nearest guess, towards nineteen, a tall comely\nyoung man, in a white fustian frock, with a green velvet cape, and cut\nbob-wig.\n\nThe youngest could not be above seventeen, fair, ruddy, completely well\nmade, and to say the truth, a sweet pretty stripling: he was too, I\nfancy, a country lad, by his dress, which was a green plush frock, and\nbreeches of the same, white waistcoat and stockings, a jockey cap, with\nhis fellowish hair, long and loose, in natural curls.\n\nBut after a look of circumspection, which I saw the eldest cast every\nway round the room, probably in too much hurry and heat not to overlook\nthe very small opening I was posted at, especially at the height it\nwas, whilst my eye close to it kept the light from shining through and\nbetraying it, he said something to his companion that presently changed\nthe face of things.\n\nFor now the elder began to embrace, to press and kiss the younger, to\nput his hands into his bosom, and give him such manifest signs of\nan amorous intention, as made me conclude the other to be a girl in\ndisguise: a mistake that nature kept me in countenance for, for she had\ncertainly made one, when she gave him the made stamp.\n\nIn the rashness then of their age, and bent as they were to accomplish\ntheir project of preposterous pleasure, at the risk of the very worst of\nconsequences, where a discovery was nothing less than improbable, they\nnow proceeded to such lengths as soon satisfied me what they were.\n\nFor presently the eldest unbuttoned the other's breeches, and removing\nthe linen barrier, brought out to view a white shaft, middle sized, and\nscarce fledged, when after handling and playing with it a little, with\nother dalliance, all received by the boy without other opposition than\ncertain wayward coyness, ten times-more alluring than repulsive, he got\nhim so turned round, with his face from him, to a chair that stood hard\nby; when knowing, I suppose, his office, the Ganymede now obsequiously\nleaned his head against the back of it, and projecting his body, made a\nfair mark, still covered with his shirt. As he thus stood in a side view\nto me, but fronting his companion, who, presently unmasking his battery,\nproduced an engine that certainly deserved to be put to a better use,\nand very fit to confirm me in my disbelief of the possibility of\nthings; being pushed to odious extremities, which I had built on the\ndisproportion of parts; but this disbelief I was now cured of, as by my\nconsent all young men should likewise be, that their innocence may not\nbe betrayed into such snares, for want of knowing the extent of their\ndanger: for nothing is more certain than that ignorance of advice is by\nno means a guard against it.\n\nSlipping, then, aside the young lad's shirt, and tucking it up under\nhis clothes behind, he shewed to the open air those globular fleshy\neminences that compose the Mount Peasants of Rome, and which now, with\nall the narrow vale that intersects them, stood displayed and exposed\nto his attack; nor could I without a shudder behold the dispositions he\nmade for it. First, then, moistening well with spittle his instrument,\nobviously to make it glib, he pointed, he introduced it, as I could\nplainly discern, not only from its direction and my losing sight of it,\nbut by the writhing, twisting and soft murmured complaints of the young\nsufferer; but at length, the first straits of entrance being pretty well\ngo through, every thing seemed to move and go pretty currently on, as on\na carpet road, without much rub or resistance; and now, passing one hand\nround his minions' hips, he got hold of his red-topped ivory toy,\nthat stood perfectly stiff, and shewed, that if he was like his mother\nbehind, he was like his father before; this he diverted himself with,\nwhilst, with the other he wantoned with his hair, and leaning forward\nover his back, drew his face, from which the boy shook the loose curls\nthat fell over it, in the posture he stood him in, and brought him\ntowards his, so as to receive a long breathed kiss; after which,\nrenewing his driving, and thus continuing to harass his rear, the height\nof the fist came on with its usual symptoms, and dismissed the action.\n\nThe criminal scene they acted, I had the patience to see to an end,\npurely that I might gather more facts and certainty against them in my\ndesign to do their deserts instant justice; and accordingly, when they\nhad re-adjusted themselves; and were preparing to go out, burning as I\nwas with rage and indignation, I jumped down from the chair, in order\nto raise the house upon them, but with such an unlucky impetuosity, that\nsome nail or ruggedness in the floor caught my foot, and flung me on my\nface with such violence, that I fell senseless on the ground, and lay\nthere some time before any one came to my relief: so that they, alarmed,\nI suppose, by the noise of my fall, had more than the necessary time\nto make a safe retreat. This they effected, as I learnt, with a\nprecipitation nobody could account for, until, when come to myself, and\ncomposed enough to speak, I acquainted those of the house with the whole\ntransaction I had been evidence to.\n\nWhen I came home again, and told Mrs. Cole this adventure, she very\nsensibly observed to me, that \"there was no doubt of the due vengeance\none time or other overtaking these miscreants, however they might escape\nfor the present; and that, had I been the temporal instrument of it, I\nshould have been put to a great deal more trouble and confusion than\nI imagined; that, as to the thing itself, the less said of it was the\nbetter; but that though she might be suspected of partiality, from its\nbeing the common cause of womankind, out of whose mouths this practice\ntended to take something more than bread, yet she protested against any\nmixture of passion, with a declaration extorted from her by pure regard\nto truth; which was, that whatever effect this infamous passion had in\nother ages and other countries, it seemed a peculiar blessing on our air\nand climate, that there was a plaguespot visibly imprinted on all that\nare tainted with it, in this nation at least, for that among numbers of\nthat stamp whom she had known, or at least were universally under the\nscandalous suspicion of it, she would not name an exception hardly to\none of them, whose character was not, in all other respects, the most\nworthless and despicable that could be; stript of all the manly virtues\nof their own sex, and filled up with only the worst vices and follies of\nours; that, in fine, they were scarce less execrable than ridiculous in\ntheir monstrous inconsistence, of loathing and contemning women, and at\nthe same time apeing all their manners, airs, lisps, scuttle, and, in\ngeneral, all their little modes of affectation, which become them at\nleast better, than they do these unsexed, male misses.\"\n\nBut here, washing my hands of them, I re-plunge into the stream of my\nhistory, which I may very properly ingraft a terrible sally of Louisa's,\nsince I had some share in it myself, and have besides engaged myself to\nrelate it, in point of countenance to poor Emily. It will add, too, one\nmore example to thousands, in confirmation of the maxim, that women get\nonce out of compass, there are no lengths of licentiousness, that they\nare not capable of running.\n\nOne morning then, that both Mrs. Cole and Emily were gone out for the\nday, and only Louisa and I (not to mention the house-maid) were left in\ncharge of the house, whilst we were loitering away the time, in looking\nthrough the shop windows, the son of a poor woman, who earned very hard\nbread indeed by mending of stockings, in a stall in the neighbourhood,\noffered us some nosegays, ranged round a small basket; by selling of\nwhich the poor boy eked out his mother's maintenance of them both: nor\nwas he fit for any other way of livelihood, since he was not only\na perfect changeling, or idiot, but stammered so that there was no\nunderstanding even those sounds his half-dozen animals ideas, at most,\nprompted him to utter.\n\nThe boys and servants in the neighbourhood had given him the nick-name\nof good-natured Dick, from the soft simpleton's doing every thing he\nwas bid at the first word, and from his naturally having no turn\nto mischief; then, by the way, he was perfectly well made, stout,\nclean-limbed, tall of his age, as strong as a horse, and, withal, pretty\nfeatured; so that he was not, absolutely, such a figure to be snuffled\nat neither, if your nicety could, in favour of such essentials, have\ndispensed with a face unwashed, hair tangled for want of combing, and\nso ragged a pliht, that he might have disputed points of shew with any\nheathen philosopher of them all.\n\nThis boy we had often seen, and bought his flowers, out of pure\ncompassion, and nothing more; but just at this time as he stood\npresenting us his basket, a sudden whim, a start of wayward fancy,\nseized Louisa; and, without consulting me, she calls him in, and\nbeginning to examine his nosegays, culls out two, one for herself,\nanother for me, and pulling out half a crown, very currently gives it\nhim to change, as if she had really expected he could have changed it:\nbut the boy, scratching his head, made his signs explain his inability\nin place of words, which he could not, with all his struggles,\narticulate.\n\nLouisa, at this, says: \"Well, my lad, come up stairs with me, and I will\ngive you your due,\" winking at the same time to me, and beckoning me to\naccompany her, which I did, securing first the street-door, that by this\nmeans, together with the shop, became wholly the care of the faithful\nhouse-maid.\n\nAs we went up, Louisa whispered me \"that she had conceived a strange\nlonging to be satisfied, whether the general rule held good with regard\nto this changeling, and how far nature had made him amends, in her best\nbodily gifts, for her denial of the sublimer intellectual ones; begin,\nat the same time, my assistance in procuring her this satisfaction.\" A\nwant of complaisance was never my vice, and I was so far from opposing\nthis extravagant frolic, that now, bit with the same maggot, and my\ncuriosity conspiring with hers, I entered plump into it, on my own\naccount.\n\nConsequently, soon as we came into Louisa's bed-chamber, whilst she was\namusing him with picking out his nosegays, I undertook the lead, and\nbegan the attack. As it was not then very material to keep much measures\nwith a mere natural, I made presently free with him, though at my first\nmotion of meddling, his surprise and confusion made him receive my\nadvances but awkwardly: nay, insomuch that he bashfully shied, and shied\nback a little; till encouraging him with my eyes, plucking him playfully\nby the hair, sleeking his cheeks, and forwarding my point by a number\nof little wantonnesses, I soon turned him familiar, and gave nature\nher sweetest alarm: so that aroused, and beginning to feel himself, we\ncould, amidst all the innocent laugh and grin I had provoked him into,\nperceive the fire lighting in his eyes, and, diffusing over his cheeks,\nblend its glow with that of his blushes. The emotion in short of animal\npleasure glared distinctly in the simpleton's countenance; yet struck\nwith the novelty of the scene, he did not know which way to look or\nmove; but tame, passive, simpering, with his mouth half open, in stupid\nrapture, stood and tractably suffered me to do what I pleased with him.\nHis basket was dropt out of his hands, which Louisa took care of.\n\nI had now, through more than one rent, discovered and felt his thighs,\nthe skin of which seemed the smoother and fairer for the coarseness, and\neven the dirt of his dress, as the teeth of negroes seem the whiter for\nthe surrounded black; and poor indeed of habit, poor of understanding,\nhe was, however, abundantly rich in personal treasures, such as flesh,\nfirm, plump, and replete with the juices of youth, and robust well-knit\nlimbs. My fingers too had now got within reach of the true, the genuine\nsensitive plant, which, instead of shrinking from the touch, joys to\nmeet it, and swells and vegetates under it: mine pleasingly informed me\nthat matters were so ripe for the discovery we meditated, that they were\ntoo mighty for the confinement they were ready to break. A waistband\nthat I unskewered, and a rag of a shirt that I removed, and which could\nnot have covered a quarter of it, revealed the whole of the idiot's\nstandard of distinction, erect, in full pride and display: but such a\none! it was positively of so tremendous a size, that prepared as we were\nto see something extraordinary, it still, out of measure, surpassed our\nexpectation, and astonished even me, who had not been used to trade in\ntrifles. In fine, it might have answered very well the making a skew of;\nits enormous head seemed, in hue and size, not unlike a common sheep's\nheart; then you might have trolled dice securely along the broad back\nof the body of it; the length of it too was prodigious; then the rich\nappendage of the treasure-bag beneath, large in proportion, gathered\nand crisped up round in shallow furrows, helped to fill the eye, and\ncomplete the proof of his being a natural, not quite in vain; since it\nwas full manifest that he inherited, and largely too, the prerogative of\nmajesty which distinguishes that otherwise most unfortunate condition,\nand gave rise to the vulgar saying \"That a fool's bauble is a lady's\nplayfellow.\" Not wholly without reason: for, generally speaking, it is\nin love as it is in war, where the longest weapon carries it. Nature,\nin short, had done so much for him in those parts, that she perhaps held\nherself acquitted in doing so little for his head.\n\nFor my part, who had sincerely no intention to push the joke further\nthan simply satisfying my curiosity with the sight of it alone, I was\ncontent, in spite of the temptation that stared me in the face, with\nhaving raised a May-pole for another to hang a garland on: for, by this\ntime, easily reading Louisa's desires in her wishful eyes, I acted the\ncommodious part, and made her, who sought no better sport, significant\nterms of encouragement to go through stitch with her adventure;\nintimating too that I would stay and see fair play: in which, indeed, I\nhad in view to humour a new born curiosity, to observe what appearances\nactive nature would put on in a natural, in the course of this her\ndarling operation.\n\nLouisa, whose appetite was up, and who, like the industrious bee, was,\nit seems, not above gathering the sweet of so rare a flower, though she\nfound it planted on a dunghill, was but too readily disposed to take\nthe benefit of my cession. Urged then strongly by her own desires, and\nemboldened by me, she presently determined to risk a trial of parts with\nthe idiot, who was by this time nobly inflamed for her purpose, by all\nthe irritation we had used to put the principles of pleasure effectually\ninto motion, and to wind up the springs of its organ to their supreme\npitch; and it stood accordingly stiff and straining, ready to burst with\nthe blood and spirits that swelled it... to a bulk! No! I shall never\nforget it.\n\nLouisa then, taking and holding the fine handle that so invitingly\noffered itself, led the ductile youth, by that mastertool of his, as she\nstept backward towards the bed; which he joyfully gave way to, under\nthe incitations of instinct, and palpably delivered up to the goad of\ndesire.\n\nStopped then by the bed, she took the fall she loved, and leaned to the\nmost, gently backward upon it, still holding fast what she held, and\ntaking care to give her clothes a convenient toss up, so that her thighs\nduly disclosed, and elevated, laid open all the outward prospect of the\ntreasury of love: the rose-lipt overture presenting the cockpit so fair,\nthat it was not in nature even for a natural to miss it. Nor did he: for\nLouisa, fully bent on grappling with it, and impatient of dalliance or\ndelay, directed faithfully the point of the battering-piece, and bounded\nup with a rage of so varocious appetite, to meet and favour the thrust\nof insertion, that the fierce activity on both sides effected it with\nsuch pain of distention, that Louisa cried out violently, that she was\nhurt beyond bearing, that she was killed. But it was too late: the storm\nwas up, and force was on her to give way to it; for now the man-machine,\nstrongly worked upon by the sensual passion, felt so manfully his\nadvantages and superiority, felt withal the sting of pleasure so\nintolerable, that maddening with it, his joys began to assume a\ncharacter of furiousness, which made me tremble for the too tender\nLouisa. He seemed, at this juncture, greater than himself; his\ncountenance, before so void of meaning, or expression, now grew big with\nthe importance of the act he was upon. In short, it was not now that he\nwas to be played the fool with. But, what is pleasant enough, I myself\nwas awed into a sort of respect for him, by the comely terrors his\nmotions dressed him in: his eyes shooting sparks of fire; his face\nglowing with ardours that gave another life to it; his teeth churning;\nhis whole frame agitated with a raging ungovernable impetuosity: all\nsensibly betraying the formidable fierceness with which the genial\ninstinct acted upon him. Butting then and goring all before him, and mad\nand wild like an ower-driven steer, he ploughs up the tender furrow all\ninsensible to Louisa's complaints; nothing can stop, nothing can keep\nout a fury like his: with which, having once got its head in, its blind\nrage soon made way for the rest, piercing, rending, and breaking open\nall obstruction. The torn, split, wounded girl cries, struggles, invokes\nme to her rescue, and endeavours to get from under the young savage,\nor shake him off, but alas! in vain: her breath, might as soon have\nstrength to have quelled his rough assault, or put him out of his\ncourse. And indeed, all her efforts and struggles were managed with such\ndisorder, that they served rather to entangle, and fold her the faster\nin the twine of his boisterous arms; so that she was tied to the stake,\nand obliged to fight the match out, if she died for it. For his part,\ninstinct-ridden as he was, the expressions of his animal passion,\npartaking something of ferocity, were rather worrying than kisses,\nintermixed with ravenous love-bites on her cheeks and necks, the prints\nof which did not wear out for some days after.\n\nPoor Louisa, however, bore up at length better than could have been\nexpected: and though she suffered, and greatly too, yet, ever true to\nthe good old cause, she suffered with pleasure and enjoyed her pain. And\nsoon now, by dint of an enraged enforcement, the brute-machine, driven\nlike a whirlwind, made all smoke again, and wedging its way up, to the\nutmost extremity, left her, in point of penetration, nothing to fear or\nto desire: and now,\n\n          \"Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,\"\n                                   (Shakespeare.)\n\nLouisa lay, pleased to the heart, pleased to her utmost capacity of\nbeing so, with every fibre in those parts, stretched almost to breaking,\non a rack of joy, whilst the instrument of all this over-fullness\nsearched her senses with its sweet excess, till the pleasure gained upon\nher so, its point stung her so home, that catching at length the rage\nfrom her furious driver and sharing the riot of his wild rapture, she\nwent wholly out of her mind into that favourite part of her body, the\nwhole intenseness of which was so fervously filled, and employed:\nthere alone she existed, all lost in those delirious transports, those\nextasies of the senses, which her winking eyes, the brightened vermilion\nof her lips and cheeks, and sighs of pleasure deeply fetched, so\npathetically expressed. In short, she was now as mere a machine as much\nwrought on, and had her motions as little at her own command, as the\nnatural himself, who, thus broke in upon her, made her feel with a\nvengeance his tempestuous mettle he battered with; their active loins\nquivered again with the violence of their conflict, till the surge of\npleasure, foaming and raging to a height, drew down the pearly shower\nthat was, to allay this hurricane. The purely sensitive idiot then first\nshed those tears of joy that attend its last moments, not without an\nagony of delight, and even almost a roar of rapture, as the gush escaped\nhim; so sensibly too for Louisa, that she kept him faithful company,\ngoing off, in consent, with the old symptoms: a delicious delirium, a\ntremendous convulsive shudder, and the critical dying: Oh! And now, on\nhis getting off she lay pleasure-drenched, and regorging its essential\nsweets; but quite spent, and gasping for breath, without other sensation\nof life than in those exquisite vibrations that trembled still on the\nstrings of delight; which had been too intensively touched, and which\nnature had so ravishingly stirred with, for the senses to be quickly at\npeace from.\n\nAs for the changeling, whose curious engine had been thus successfully\nplayed off, his shift of countenance and gesture had even something\ndroll, or rather tragi-comic in it: there was now an air of sad repining\nfoolishness, superadded to his natural one of no meaning and idiotism,\nas he stood with his label of manhood, now lank, unstiffened, becalmed,\nand flapping against his thighs, down which it reached half way,\nterrible even in its fall, whilst under the dejection of spirit and\nflesh, which naturally followed his eyes, by turns, cast down towards\nhis struck standard, or piteously lifted to Louisa, seemed to require at\nher hands what he had so sensibly parted from to her, and now ruefully\nmissed. But the vigour of nature, soon returning, dissipated the blast\nof faintness which the common law of enjoyment had subjected him to;\nand now his basket re-became his main concern, which I looked for, and\nbrought him, whilst Louisa restored his dress to its usual condition,\nand afterwards pleased him perhaps more by taking all his flowers\noff his hands, and paying him, at his rate, for them, than if she had\nembarrassed him by a present, that he would have been puzzled to account\nfor, and might have put others on tracing the motives of.\n\nWhether she ever returned to the attack I know not, and, to say truth,\nI believe not. She had had her freak out, and had pretty plentifully\ndrowned her curiosity in a glut of pleasure, which, as it happened, had\nno other consequence than that the lad, who retained only a confused\nmemory of the transaction, would, when he saw her, forget her in favour\nof the next woman, tempted, on the report of his parts, to take him in.\nLouisa herself did not long outstay this adventure at Mrs. Cole's (to\nwhom, by the bye, we took care not to boast of our exploit, till all\nfear of consequences were clearly over): for an occasion presenting\nitself of proving her passion for a young fellow, at the expense of her\ndiscretion, proceeding all in character, she packed up her toilet, at\nhalf a day's warning, and went with him abroad, since which I entirely\nlost sight of her, and it never fell in my way to hear what became of\nher.\n\nBut a few days after she had left us, two very occasion, not to wrong\nour training at Mrs. Cole's, especially favourites, and free of her\nacademy, easily obtained her consent for Emily's and my acceptance of a\nparty of pleasure, at a little but agreeable house, belonging to one of\nthem situated not far up the river Thames, on the Surrey side.\n\nEvery thing being settled, and it being a fine summer day, but rather\nof the warmest, we set out after dinner, and got to our rendezvous about\nfour in the afternoon; where, landing at the foot of a neat, joyous\npavilion, Emily and I were handed into it by our esquires, and there\ndrank tea with a cheerfulness and gaiety, that the beauty of the\nprospect, the serenity of the weather, and the tender politeness of our\nsprightly gallants, naturally led us into.\n\nAfter tea, and taking a turn in the garden, my particular, who was the\nmaster of the house, and had in no sense schemed this party of pleasure\nfor a dry one, proposed to us, with that frankness which his familiarity\nat Mrs. Cole's entitled him to, as the weather was excessively hot,\nto bathe together, under a commodious shelter that he had prepared\nexpressly for that purpose, in a creek of the river, with which a\nside-door of the pavilion immediately communicated, and where we might\nbe sure of having our diversion out, safe from interruption, and with\nthe utmost privacy.\n\nEmily, who never refused anything, and I, who ever delighted in bathing,\nand had no exception to the person who proposed it, or to those pleasure\nit was easy to guess it implied, took care, on this occasion, not to\nwrong our training at Mrs. Cole's, and agreed to it with as good a grace\nas we could. Upon which, without loss of time, we returned instantly to\nthe pavilion, one door of which opened into a tent, pitched before it,\nthat with its marquise, formed a pleasing defense again the sun, or the\nweather, and was besides as private as we could wish. The lining of it,\nembossed cloth, represented a wild forest foliage, from the top, down to\nthe sides, which, in the same stuff, were figured with fluted pilasters,\nwith their spaces between filled with flower vases, the whole having a\npay effect croon the eye, wherever you turned it.\n\nThen it reached sufficiently into the water, yet contained convenient\nbenches round it, on the dry ground, either to keep our clothes, or...,\nor..., in short for more uses than resting upon. There was a side-table\ntoo, loaded with sweetmeats, jellies, and other eatables, and bottles\nof wine and cordials, by way of occasional relief from any rawness, or\nchill of the water, or from any faintness from whatever cause; and in\nfact, my gallant, who understood chere entiere perfectly, and who, for\ntaste (even if you would not approve this specimen of it) might have\nbeen comptroller of pleasures to a Roman emperor, had left no requisite\ntowards convenience or luxury unprovided.\n\nAs soon as we had looked round this inviting spot, and every preliminary\nof privacy was duly settled, strip was the word: when the young\ngentlemen soon dispatched the undressing each his partner and reduced\nus to the naked confession of all those secrets of person which dress\ngenerally hides, and which the discovery of was, naturally speaking, not\nto our disadvantage. Our hands, indeed, mechanically carried towards\nthe most interesting part of us, screened, at first, all from the tufted\ncliff downwards, till we took them away at their desire, and employed\nthem in doing them the same office, of helping off with their clothes;\nin the process of which, there passed all the little wantonnesses and\nfrolics that you may easily imagine.\n\nAs for my spark, he was presently undressed, all to his shirt, the\nfore-lappet of which as he leaned languishingly on me, he smilingly\npointed to me to observe, as it bellied out, or rose and fell, according\nto the unruly starts of the motion behind it; but it was soon fixed, for\nnow taking off his shirt, and naked as a Cupid, he shewed it me at so\nupright a stand, as prepared me indeed for his application to me for\ninstant ease; but, though the sight of its fine size was fit enough to\nfire me, the cooling air, as I stood in this state of nature, joined\nto the desire I had of bathing-first, enabled me to put him off, and\ntranquillize him, with the remark, that a little suspense would only\nset a keener edge on the pleasure. Leading them the way, and shewing our\nfriends an example of continency, which they were giving signs of losing\nrespect to, we went hand in hand into the stream, till it took us up to\nour necks, where the no more than grateful coolness of the wafer gave\nmy senses a delicious refreshment from the sultriness of the season, and\nmade more alive, more happy in myself, and, in course, more alert, and\nopen to voluptuous impressions.\n\nHere I laved and wantoned with the water, or sportively played with\nmy companion, leaving Emily to deal with hers at discretion. Mine, at\nlength, not content with making me take the plunge over head and ears,\nkept splashing me, and provoking me with all the little playful tricks\nhe could devise, and which I strove not to remain in his debt for. We\ngave, in short, a loose to mirth; and now, nothing would serve him but\ngiving his hand the regale of going over every part of me, neck, breast,\nbelly, thighs, and all the et caetera, so dear to the imagination, under\nthe pretext of washing and rubbing them; as we both stood in the water,\nno higher now than the pit of our stomachs, and which did not hinder him\nfrom feeling, and toying with that leak that distinguishes our sex, and\nit so wonderfully water-tight: for his fingers, in vain dilating and\nopening it, only let more flame than water into it, be it said without\na figure. At the same time he made me feel his own engine, which was so\nwell wound up, as to stand even the working in water, and he accordingly\nthrew one arm round my neck, and was endeavouring to get the better\nof that harsher construction bred by the surrounding fluid; and had in\neffect one hiway so far as to make me sensible of the pleasing stretch\nof those nether lips, from the in-driving machine; when, independent\nof my not liking that awkward mode of enjoyment, I could not help\ninterrupting him, in order to become joint spectators of a plan of joy,\nin hot operation between Emily and her partner; who impatient of the\nfooleries and dalliance of the bath, had led his nymph to one of the\nbenches on the green bank, where he was very cordially proceeding to\nteach her the difference betwixt jest and earnest.\n\nThere, setting her on his knee, and gliding one hand over the surface\nof that smooth polished snow-white skin of hers, which now doubly shone\nwith a dew-bright lustre, and presented to the touch something like what\none would imagine of animated ivory, especially in those ruby-nippled\nglobes, which the touch is so fond of and delights to make love to,\nwith the other h was lusciously exploring the sweet secret of nature,\nin order to make room for a stately piece of machinery, that stood\nup-reared, between her thighs, as she continued siting on his lap, and\npressed hard for instant intromission, which the tender Emily, in a\nfit of humour deliciously protracted, affected to decline, and elude the\nvery pleasure she sighed for, but in a style of waywardness, so prettily\nput on, and managed, as to render it ten times more poignant; then her\neyes, all amidst the softest dying languishment, expressed, ait once a\nmock denial and extreme desire, whilst her sweetness was zested with a\ncoyness so pleasingly provoking, her moods of keeping him off were\nso attractive, that they redoubled the impetuous rage with, which, he\ncovered her with kisses: and kisses that, whilst she seemed to shy from\nor scuffle for, the cunning wanton contrived such sly returns, of, as\nwere, doubtless the sweeter for the gust she gave them, of being stolen\nravished.\n\nThus Emily, who knew no art but that which nature itself, in favour\nof her principal end, pleasure, had inspired her with, the art of\nyielding, coyed it indeed, but coyed it to the purpose; for with all\nher straining, her wrestling, and striving to break from the clasp\nof his arms, she was so far wiser yet than to mean it, that in her\nstruggles, it was visible she aimed at nothing more than multiplying\npoints of touch with him, and drawing yet closer the folds that held\nthem every where entwined, like two tendrils of a vine intercurling:\ntogether: so that the same effect, as when Louisa strove in good earnest\nto disengage from the idiot, was-now produced by different motives.\n\nMean while, their emersion out of the cold water had caused a general\nglow, a tender suffusion of heightened carnation over their bodies;\nboth equally white and smoothskinned; so that as their limbs were-thus\namorously interwoven, in sweet confusion, it was scarce possible to\ndistinguish who they respectively belonged to, but for the brawnier,\nbolder muscles of the stronger sex.\n\nIn a little time, however, the champion was fairly in with her, and had\ntied at all points the true lover's knot; when now, adieu all the little\nrefinements of a finessed reluctance; adieu the friendly feint! She was\npresently driven forcibly out of the power of using any art; and\nindeed, what art must not give way, when nature, corresponding with her\nassailant, invaded in the heart of her capital and carried by storm, lay\nat the mercy of the proud conqueror, who had made his entry triumphantly\nand completely? Soon, however, to become a tributary: for the engagement\ngrowing hotter and hotter, at close quarters, she presently brought him\nto the pass of paying down the dear debt to nature; which she had no\nsooner collected in, but, like a duellist who has laid his antagonist at\nhis feet, when he has himself received a mortal wound, Emily had\nscarce time to plume herself upon her victory, but, shot with the same\ndischarge, she, in a loud expiring sigh, in the closure of her eyes,\nthe stretch-out of her limbs, and a remission of her whole frame, gave\nmanifest signs that all was as it should be.\n\nFor my part, who had not with the calmest patience stood in the water\nall this time, to view this warm action, I leaned tenderly on my\ngallant, and at the close of it, seemed to ask him with my eyes, what he\nthought of it; but he, more eager to satisfy me by his actions than by\nwords or looks, as we shoaled the water towards the shore, showed me the\nstaff of love so intensely set up, that had not even charity, beginning\nat home in this case, urged me to our mutual relief, it would have been\ncruel indeed to have suffered the youth to burst with straining, when\nthe remedy was so obvious and so near at hand.\n\nAccordingly we took a bench, whilst Emily and her spark, who belonged it\nseems to the sea, stood at the side-board, drinking to our good voyage:\nfor, as the last observed, we were well under weigh, with a fair wind up\nchannel, and full-freighted; nor indeed were we long before we finished\nour trip to Cythera, and unloaded in the old haven; but, as the\ncircumstances-did not admit of much variation, I shall spare you the\ndescription.\n\nAt the same time, allow me to place you here an excuse I am conscious of\nowing you, for having, perhaps, too much affected the figurative style;\nthough surely, it can pass nowhere more allowable than in a subject\nwhich is so properly the province of poetry, nay, is poetry itself,\npregnant with every flower of imagination and loving metaphors, even\nwere not the natural expressions, for respects of fashion and sound,\nnecessarily forbidden.\n\nResuming now my history, you may please to know, that what with a\ncompetent number of repetitions, all in the same strain (and, by the\nbye, we have a certain natural sense that those repetitions are very\nmuch to the taste), what with a circle of pleasures delicately varied,\nthere was not a moment lost to joy all the time we staid there,\ntill late in the night we were re-escorted home by our esquires, who\ndelivered us safe to Mrs. Cole, with generous thanks for our company.\n\nThis too was Emily's last adventure in our way: for scarce a week after,\nshe was, by an accident too trivial to detail to you the particulars,\nfound out by her parents, who were in good circumstances, and who had\nbeen punished for their partiality to their son, in the loss of him,\noccasioned by a circumstance of their over indulgence to his appetite;\nupon which the so long engrossed stream of fondness, running violently\nin favour of this lost and inhumanly abandoned child whom if they had\nnot neglected enquiry about, they might long before have recovered, they\nwere now so over-joyed at the retrieval of her, that, I presume, it made\nthem much less strict in examining the bottom of things: for they seemed\nvery glad to take for granted, in the lump, every thing that the grave\nand decent Mrs. Cole was pleased to pass upon them; and soon afterwards\nsent her, from the country, handsome acknowledgment.\n\nBut it was not so easy to replace to our community the loss of so sweet\na member of it: for, not to mention her beauty, she was one of those\nmild, pliant characters, that if one does not entirely esteem, one can\nscarce help loving, which is not such a bad compensation neither. Owing\nall her weaknesses to good nature, and an indolent facility that kept\nher too much at the mercy of first impressions, she had just sense\nenough to know that she wanted leading strings, and thought herself so\nmuch obliged to any who would take the pains to think for her, and guide\nher, that with a very little management, she was capable of being made a\nmost agreeable, nay a most virtuous wife: for vice, it is probable, had\nnever been her choice, or her fate, if it had not been for occasion,\nor example, or had she not depended less upon herself than upon her\ncircumstances. This presumption her conduct afterwards verified: for\npresently meeting with a match, that was ready cut and dry for her, with\na neighbour's son of her own rank, and a young man of sense and order,\nwho took as the widow of one lost at sea (for so it seems one of her\ngallants, whose name she had made free with, really was), she naturally\nstruck into all the duties of her domestic life, with as much simplicity\nof affection, with as much constancy and regularity, as if she had never\nswerved from a state of undebauched innocence from her youth.\n\nThese desertions had, however, now so far thinned Mrs. Cole's cluck that\nshe was left with only me, like a hen with one chicken; but though she\nwas earnestly entreated and encouraged to recruit her crops, her growing\ninfirmities, and, above all, the tortures, of a stubborn hip gout,\nwhich she found would yield to no remedy, determined her to break up her\nbusiness, and retire with a decent pittance into the country, where I\npromised myself, nothing so sure, as my going down to live with her, as\nsoon as I had seen a little more of life, and improved my small matters\ninto a competency that would create in me an independence on the world:\nfor I was now, thanks to Mrs. Cole, wise enough to keep that essential\nin view.\n\nThus was I then to lose my faithful preceptress, as did the philosophers\nof the town the white crow of her profession. For besides that she never\nransacked her customers, whose tastes too she ever studiously consulted,\nshe never racked her pupils with unconscionable extortions, nor ever\nput their hard earnings, as she called them, under the contribution of\npoundage. She was a severe enemy to the seduction for innocence, and\nconfined her acquisitions solely to those unfortunate young women, who,\nhaving lost it, were but the juster objects of compassion: among these,\nindeed, she picked out such as suited her views and taking them under\nher protection, rescued them from the danger of the public sinks of ruin\nand misery, to place, or for them, well or ill, in the manner you have\nseen. Having then settled her affairs, she set out on her journey, after\ntaking the most tender leave of me, and at the end of some excellent\ninstructions, recommending me to myself, with an anxiety perfectly\nmaternal. In short, she affected me so much, that I was not presently\nreconciled to myself for suffering her at any rate to go without me; but\nfate had, it seems, otherwise disposed of me.\n\nI had, on my separation from Mrs. Cole, taken a pleasant convenient\nhouse at Marylebone, but easy to rent and manage from its smallness,\nwhich I furnished neatly and modestly. There, with a reserve of eight\nhundred pounds, the fruit of my deference to Mrs. Cole's counsels,\nexclusive of clothes, some jewels, and some plate, I saw myself in purse\nfor a long time, to wait without impatience for what the chapter of\naccidents might produce in my favour.\n\nHere, under the new character of a young gentlewoman whose husband was\ngone to sea, I had marked me out such lines of life and conduct, as\nleaving me a competent liberty to pursue my views either out of pleasure\nor fortune, bounded me nevertheless strictly within the rules of decency\nand discretion: a disposition, in which you cannot escape observing a\ntrue pupil of Mrs. Cole.\n\nI was scarce, however, well warm in my new abode, when going out one\nmorning pretty early to enjoy the freshness of it, in the pleasing\noutlet of the fields, accompanied only by a maid, whom I had newly\nhired, as we were carelessly walking among the trees, we were alarmed\nwith the noise of a violent coughing: turning our heads towards which,\nwe distinguished a plain well dressed elderly gentleman, who, attacked\nwith a sudden fit, was so much overcome, as to be forced to give way to\nit and sit down at the foot of a tree, where he seemed suffocating with\nthe severity of it, being perfectly black in the face; not less moved\nthan frightened with which, I flew on the instant to his relief, and\nusing the rote of practice I had observed on the like occasion, I\nloosened his cravat and clapped him on the back; but whether to any\npurpose, or whether the cough had had its course, I know not, but the\nfit immediately went off; and now recovered to his speech and legs, he\nreturned me thanks with as much emphasis as if I had saved his life.\nThis naturally engaging a conversation, he acquainted me where he lived,\nwhich was at a considerable distance from where I met him, and where he\nhad strayed insensibly on the same intention of a morning walk.\n\nHe was, as I afterwards learned in the course of the intimacy which this\nlittle accident gave birth to, an old bachelor, turned of sixty, but\nof a fresh vigorous complexion, insomuch that he scarce marked five and\nforty, having never racked his constitution by permitting his desires to\nover-tax his ability.\n\nAs to his birth and conditions, his parents, honest and failed\nmechanics, had, by the best traces he could get of them, left him an\ninfant orphan on the parish; so that it was from a charity-school, that,\nby honesty and industry, he made his way into a merchant's counting\nhouse, from whence, being sent to a house in Cadiz, he there, by his\ntalents and activity, acquired not only a fortune, but an immense\none, with which he returned to his native country; where he could not,\nhowever, fish out so much as one single relation out of the obscurity\nhe was born in. Taking then a taste for refinement, and pleased to enjoy\nlife, like a mistress in the dark, he flowed his days in all the ease\nof opulence, without the least parade of it; and, rather studying\nthe concealment than the shew of a fortune, looked down on a world he\nperfectly knew himself, to his wish, unknown and unmarked by.\n\nBut, as I propose to devote a letter entirely to the pleasure of\nretracing to you all the particulars of my acquaintance with this ever,\nto me, memorable friend, I shall, in this, transiently touch on no\nmore than may serve, as mortar, to cement, or form the connection of my\nhistory, and to obviate your surprise that one of my blood and relish of\nlife, should count a gallant of three score such a catch.\n\nReferring then to a more explicit narrative, to explain by what\nprogressions our acquaintance, certainly innocent at first, insensibly\nchanged nature, and run into unplatonic length, as might well be\nexpected from one of my condition of life, and above all, from that\nprinciple of electricity that scarce ever fails of producing fire when\nthe sexes meet. I shall only here acquaint you, that as age had not\nsubdued his tenderness for our sex, neither had it robbed him of the\npower of pleasing, since whatever he wanted in the bewitching charms of\nyouth, he atoned for, or supplemented with the advantages of experience,\nthe sweetness of his manners, and above all, his flattering address in\ntouching the heart, by an application to the understanding. From him it\nwas I first learned, to any purpose, and not without infinite pleasure,\nthat I had such a portion of me worth bestowing some regard on; from him\nI received my first essential encouragement, and instructions how to put\nit in that train of cultivation, which I have since pushed to the little\ndegree of improvement you see it at; he it was, who first taught me to\nbe sensible that the pleasures of the mind were superior to those of\nthe body; at the same time, that they were so far from obnoxious to, or,\nincompatible with each other, that, besides the sweetness in the variety\nand transition, the one served to exalt and perfect the taste of the\nother, to a degree that the senses alone can never arrive at.\n\nHimself a rational pleasurist; as being much too wise to be ashamed of\nthe pleasures of humanity, loved me indeed, but loved me with dignity;\nin a mean equally removed from the sourness, of forwardness, by which\nage is unpleasingly characterized, and from that childish silly dotage\nthat so often disgraces it, and which he himself used to turn into\nridicule, and compare to an old goat affecting the frisk of a young kid.\n\nIn short, every thing that is generally unamiable in his season of life,\nwas, in him, repaired by so many advantages, that he existed a proof,\nmanifest at least to me, that it is not out of the power of age to\nplease, if it lays out to please, and if, making just allowance, those\nin that class do not forget, that if must cost them more pains and\nattention, than what youth, the natural spring-time of joy, stands in\nneed of: as fruits out of season require proportionally more skill and\ncultivation, to force them.\n\nWith this gentleman, who took me home soon after our acquaintance\ncommenced, I lived near eight months in which time, my constant\ncomplaisance and docility, my attention to deserve his confidence and\nlove, and a conduct, in general, devoid of the least art and founded on\nmy sincere regard and esteem for him, won and attached him so firmly to\nme, that, after having generously trusted me with a genteel, independent\nsettlement, proceeding to heap marks of affection on me, he appointed\nme, by an authentic will, his sole heiress and executrix: a disposition\nwhich he did not outlive two months, being taken from me by a violent\ncold that he contracted, as he unadvisedly ran to the window, on an\nalarm of fire at some streets distant, and stood there naked-breasted,\nand exposed to the fatal impressions of a damp night air.\n\nAfter acquitting myself of the duty towards my deceased benefactor, and\npaying him a tribute of un-feigned sorrow, which a little time changed\ninto a most tender, graceful memory of him, which I shall ever retain, I\ngrew somewhat comforted by the prospect that now opened to me, if not of\nhappiness, at least of affluence and independence.\n\nI saw myself then in the full bloom and pride of youth (for I was not\nyet nineteen), actually at the head of so large a fortune, as it would\nhave been even the height of impudence in me to have raised my wishes,\nmuch more my hopes to; and that this unexpected elevation did not turn\nmy head, I owed to the pains my benefactor had taken to form and\nprepare me for it, as I owed his opinion of my management of the vast\npossessions he left me, to what he had observed of the prudential\neconomy I had learned under Mrs. Cole, the reserve of which he saw I had\nmade, was a proof and encouragement to him.\n\nBut, alas! how easily in the enjoyment of the greatest sweets in life,\nin present possession, poisoned by the regret of an absent one! But my\nregret was a mighty and just one, since it had my only truly beloved\nCharles for its object.\n\nGiven him up I had, indeed, completely, having never once heard from\nhim since our separation; which, as I found afterwards, had been my\nmisfortune, and not his neglect, for he wrote me several letters which\nhad all miscarried; but forgotten him I never had. And amidst all my\npersonal infidelities, not one had made a pin's point impression on a\nheart impenetrable to the true love passion, but for him.\n\nAs soon, however, as I was mistress of this unexpected fortune, I felt\nmore than ever how dear he was to me, from its insufficiency to make\nme happy, whilst he was not to share it with me. My earliest care,\nconsequently, was to endeavour at getting some account of him; but all\nmy researches produced me no more light, than that his father had been\ndead for some time, not so well as even with the world; and that Charles\nhad reached his port of destination in the South Seas, where, finding\nthe estate he was sent to recover, dwindled to a trifle, by the loss of\ntwo ships in which the bulk of his uncle's fortune lay, he was come\naway with the small remainder, and might, perhaps, according to the best\nadvice, in a few months return to England, from whence he had, at the\ntime of this my inquiry, been absent two years and seven months. A\nlittle eternity in love!\n\nYou cannot conceive with what joy I embraced the hopes thus given me\nof seeing the delight of my heart again. But, as the term of months was\nassigned it, in order to divert and amuse my impatience for his return,\nafter settling my affairs with much ease and security, I set out on a\njourney for Lancashire, with an equipage suitable to my fortune, and\nwith a design purely to revisit my place of nativity, for which I could\nnot help retaining a great tenderness; and might naturally not be sorry\nto shew myself there, to the advantage I was now in pass to do, after\nthe report Esther Davis had spread of my being spirited away to the\nplantations; for on no other supposition could she account for the\nsuppression of myself to her, since her leaving me so abruptly at the\ninn. Another favourite intention I had, to look out for my relations,\nthough I had none but distant ones, and prove a benefactress to them.\nThen Mrs. Cole's place of retirement lying in my way, was not amongst\nthe least of the pleasures I had proposed to myself in this expedition.\n\nI had taken nobody with me but a discreet decent woman, to figure it as\nmy companion, besides my servants; and was scarce got into an inn, about\ntwenty miles from London, where I was to sup and pass the night, when\nsuch a storm of wind and rain come on, as made me congratulate myself on\nhaving got under shelter before it began.\n\nThis had continued a good half an hour, when bethinking me of some\ndirections to be given to the coachman, I sent for him, not caring that\nhis shoes should soil the very clean parlour, in which the cloth was\nlaid, I stept into the hall kitchen, where he was, and where, whilst I\nwas talking to him, I slantingly observed two horsemen driven in by the\nweather, and both wringing wet; one of whom was asking if they could not\nbe assisted with a change, while their clothes were dried. But, heavens!\nwho can express what I felt at the sound of a voice, ever present to my\nheart, and that it now rebounded at! or when pointing my eyes towards\nthe person it came from, they confirmed its information, in spite of so\nlong an absence, and of a dress one would have studied for a disguise: a\nhorseman's great coat, with a stamp-up cape, and his hat flapped...\nbut what could escape the alertness of a sense truly guided by love?\nA transport then like mine was above all consideration, or schemes of\nsurprise; and I, that instant, with the rapidity of the emotions that I\nfelt the spur of, shot into his arms, crying out, as I threw mine round\nhis neck: \"My life!... my soul!... my Charles!..\" and without further\npower of speech, swooned away, under the pressing agitation of joy and\nsurprise.\n\nRecovered out of my entrancement, I found myself in my charmer's arms,\nbut in the parlour, surrounded by a crowd which this event had gathered\nround us, and which immediately, on a signal from the discreet landlady,\nwho currently took him for my husband, cleared the room, and desirably\nleft us alone to the raptures of this reunion; my joy at which had like\nto have proved, at the expense of my life, its power superior to that of\ngrief at our fatal separation.\n\nThe first object then, that my eyes opened on, was their supreme idol,\nand my supreme wish, Charles, on one knee, holding me fast by the hand\nand gazing on me with a transport of fondness. Observing my recovery,\nhe attempted to speak, and give vent to his patience of hearing my voice\nagain, to satisfy him once more that it was I; but the mightiness and\nsuddenness Of the surprise continuing to stun him, choked his utterance:\nhe could only stammer out a few broken, half-formed, filtering accents,\nwhich my ears greedily drinking in, spelt, and put together, so as to\nmake out their sense: \"After so long!... so cruel an absence!... my\ndearest Fanny!... can it?... can it be you?...\" stifling me at the time\nwith kisses, that, stopping my opening mouth, at once prevented the\nanswer that he panted for, and increased the delicious disorder in\nwhich all my senses were rapturously lost. However, amidst this crowd of\nideas, and all blissful ones, there obtruded only one cruel doubt that\npoisoned nearly all the transcendant happiness: and what was it, but my\ndread of its being too excessive to be real? I trembled now with my\nfear of its being no more than a dream, and of waking out of it into\nthe horrors of finding it one. Under this fond apprehension, imagining\nI could not make too much of the present prodigious joy, before it would\nvanish and leave me in the desert again, nor verify its reality too\nstrongly, I clung to him, I clasped him, as if to hinder him from\nescaping me again: \"Where have you been?... how could you... could you\nleave me?... Say you are still mine... that you still love me... and\nthus! thus!\" (kissing him as if I would consolidated lips with him) \"I\nforgive you... forgive my hard fortune in favour of this restoration.\"\n\nAll these interjections breaking from me, in that wildness of expression\nthat justly passes for eloquence in love, drew from him all the returns\nmy fond heart could wish or require. Our caresses, our questions, our\nanswers, for some time observed no order; all crossing, or interrupting\none another in sweet confusion, whilst we exchanged hearts at our eyes,\nand renewed the ratifications of a love unabated by time or absence:\nnot a breath, not a motion, not a gesture on either side, but what was\nstrongly impressed with it. Our hands, locked in each other, repeated\nthe most passionate squeezes, so that their fiery thrill went to the\nheart again.\n\nThus absorbed, and concentered in this unutterable delight, I had not\nattended to the sweet author of it being thoroughly wet, and in danger\nof catching cold; when, in good time, the landlady, whom the appearance\nof my equipage (which, bye the bye Charles knew nothing of) had gained\nme an interest in, for me and mine interrupted us by bringing in a\ndecent shift of linen and clothes; which now, somewhat recovered into\na calmer composure by the coming in of a third person, I pressed him\nto take the benefit of, with a tender con-cern and anxiety that made me\ntremble for his health.\n\nThe landlady leaving us again, he proceeded to shift; in the act of\nwhich, though he proceeded with all that modesty which became these\nfirst solemner instants of our re-meeting, after so long an absence,\nI could not refrain certain snatches of my eyes, lured by the dazzling\ndiscoveries of his naked skin, that escaped him as he changed his linen,\nand which I could not observe the unfaded life and complexion of without\nemotions of tenderness and joy, that had himself too purely for their\nobject, to partake of a loose or mis-timed desire.\n\nHe was soon dressed in these temporary clothes, which neither fitted\nhim, nor became the light my passion placed him in, to me at least; yet,\nas they were on him, they looked extremely well, in virtue of that magic\ncharm which love put into every thing that he-touched, or had relation\nto him: and where, indeed, was that dress that a figure like his would\nnot give grace to? For now, as I eyed him more in detail, I could not\nbut observe the even favourable alteration which the time of his absence\nhad produced in his person.\n\nThere were still the requisite lineaments, still the same vivid\nvermillion and bloom reigning in his face; but now the roses were\nmore fully blown; the tan of his travels, and a beard somewhat more\ndistinguishable, had, at the expense of no more delicacy than what he\ncould well spare, given it an air of becoming manliness and maturity,\nthat symmetrized nobly with that air of distinction and empire with\nwhich nature had stamped it, in a rare mixture with the sweetness of\nit; still nothing had he lost of that smooth plumpness of flesh, which,\nglowing with freshness, blooms florid to the eye, and delicious to the\ntouch; then his shoulders were grown more square, his shape more formed,\nmore portly, but still free and airy. In short, his figure showed riper,\ngreater, and perfecter to the experienced eye, than in his tender youth;\nand now he was not much more than two and twenty.\n\nIn this interval, however, I picked out of the broken, often pleasingly\ninterrupted account of himself, that he was, at that instant, actually\non his road to London, in not a very paramount plight or condition,\nhaving been wrecked on the Irish coast for which he had prematurely\nembarked, and lost the little all he had brought with him from the South\nSeas: so that he had not till after great shifts and hardships, in the\ncompany of his fellow-traveller, the captain, got so far on his journey;\nthat so it was (having heard of his father's death and circumstances,)\nhe had now the world to begin again, on a new account: a situation,\nwhich he assured me, in a vein of sincerity, that flowing from his\nheart, penetrated mine, gave him to farther pain, than that he had not\nhis power to make me as happy as he could wish. My fortune, you will\nplease to observe, I had not entered upon any overture of, reserving, to\nfeast myself with the surprise of it to him, in calmer instants. And, as\nto my dress, it could give him no idea of the truth, not only as it was\nmourning, but likewise in a style of plainness and simplicity that I had\never kept to with studied art. He pressed me indeed tenderly to satisfy\nhis ardent curiosity, both with regard to my past and present state of\nlife, since his being torn away from me: but I found means to elude\nhis questions, by answers that shewing his satisfaction at no great\ndistance, won upon him to waive his impatience, in favour of the\nthorough confidence he had in my not delaying it, but for respect I\nshould in good time acquaint him with.\n\nCharles, however, thus returned to my longing arms, tender, faithful,\nand in health, was already a blessing too mighty for my conception: but\nCharles in distress!... Charles reduced, and broken down to his naked\npersonal merit, was such a circumstance, in favour of the sentiments I\nhad for him, as exceeded my utmost desire; and accordingly I seemed so\nvisibly charmed, so out of time and measure pleased at his mention of\nhis ruined fortune, that he could account for it no way, but that the\njoy of seeing him again had swallowed up every other sense of concern.\n\nIn the mean time, my woman had taken, all possible care of Charles's\ntravelling companion; and as supper was coming in, he was introduced\nto me, when I received him as became my regard for all of Charles's\nacquaintance or friends.\n\nWe four then supped together, in the style of joy, congratulation, and\npleasing disorder that you may guess. For my part, though all these\nagitations had left me not the least stomach, but for that uncloying\nfeast, the sight of my adored youth, I endeavoured to force it, by way\nof example for him, who I conjectured must want such a recruit after\nriding; and, indeed, he; ate like a traveller, but gazed at, and\naddressed me all the time like a lover.\n\nAfter the cloth was taken away, and the hour of repose came on, Charles\nand I were, without further ceremony, in quality of man and wife, shown\nup together to a very handsome apartment, and, all in course, the bed,\nthey said, the best in the inn.\n\nAnd here, Decency, forgive me! if once more I violate thy laws and\nkeeping the curtains undrawn, sacrifice thee for the last time to that\nconfidence, without reserve, with which I engaged to recount to you the\nmost striking circumstances of my youthful disorders.\n\nAs soon, then, as we were in the room together, left to ourselves, the\nsight of the bed starving the remembrance of our first joys, and the\nthought of my being instantly to share it with the dear possessor of my\nvirgin heart, moved me so strongly, that it was well I leaned upon him,\nor I must have fainted again under the overpowering sweet alarm. Charles\nsaw into my confusion, and forgot his own, that was scarce less, to\napply himself to the removal of mine.\n\nBut now the true refining passion had regained throughout possession\nof me, with all its train of symptoms: a sweet sensibility, a tender\ntimidity, love-sick yearnings tempered with diffidence and modesty, all\nheld me in a subjection of soul, incomparably dearer to me than the\nliberty of heart which I had been long, too long! the mistress of, in\nthe course of those grosser gallantries, the consciousness of which now\nmade me sigh with a virtuous confusion and regret. No real virgin, in\nshort, in view of the nuptial bed, could give more bashful blushes to\nunblemished innocence, than I did to a sense of guilt; and indeed I\nloved Charles too truly not to feel severely that I did not deserve him.\n\nAs I kept hesitating and disconcerted under this soft distraction,\nCharles, with a fond impatience, took the pains to undress me; and all I\ncan remember amidst the nutter and discomposure of my senses, was, some\nflattering exclamation of joy and admiration, more specially at the feel\nof my breasts, now set at liberty from my stays, and which panting and\nrising in tumultous throbs, swelled upon his dear touch, and gave it the\nwelcome pleasure of finding them well formed, and un-failed in firmness.\n\nI was soon laid in bed, and scarce languished an instant for the darling\npartner of it, before he was undressed and got between the sheets, with\nhis arms clasped round me, giving and taking, with gust inexpressible,\na kiss of welcome, that my heart rising to my lips stamped with its\nwarmest impression, concurring to my bliss, with that delicate and\nvoluptuous emotion which Charles alone had the secret to excite, and\nwhich constitutes the very life, the essence of pleasure.\n\nMean while, two candles lighted on a side-table near us, and a joyous\nwood fire, threw a light into the bed, that took from one sense, of\ngreat importance to our joys, all pretext for complaining of its being\nshut out of its share of them; and, indeed, the sight of my idolized\nyouth was alone, from the ardour with which I had wished for it, without\nother circumstance, a pleasure to die of.\n\nBut as action was now a necessity to desires so much on edge as ours,\nCharles, after a very short prelusive dalliance, lifting up my linen and\nhis own, laid the broad treasures of his manly chest close to my bosom,\nboth beating with the tenderest alarms: when now, the sense of his\nglowing body, in naked touch with mine, took all power over my thoughts\nout of my own disposal, and delivered up every faculty of the soul\nto the sensiblest of joys, that affecting me infinitely more with\nmy distinction of the person, than of the sex, now brought my heart\ndeliriously into play: my heart, which, eternally constant to Charles,\nhad never taken any part in my original sacrifices to the calls of\nconstitution, complaisance, or interest. But ah! what became of me,\nwhen as the powers of solid pleasure thickened upon me, I could not help\nfeeling the stiff stake that had been adorned with the trophies of\nmy despoiled virginity, bearing hard and inflexible against one of my\nthighs, which I had not yet opened, from a true principle of modesty,\nrevived by a passion too sincere to suffer any aiming at the false merit\nof difficulty, or my putting on an impertinent mock coyness.\n\nI have, I believe, somewhere before remarked, that feel of that\nfavourite piece of manhood has, in the very nature of it, something\ninimitably pathetic. Nothing can be dearer to the touch, nor can affect\nit with a more delirious sensation. Think then! as a love thinks, what\nmust be the consummate transport of that quickest of our senses, in\ntheir central seat too! when, after so long a deprival, it felt itself\nre-inflamed under the pressure of that peculiar sceptre-member, which\ncommands us all: but especially my darling, elect from the face of the\nwhole earth. And now, at its mightiest point of stiffness, it felt to me\nsomething so subduing so active, so solid and agreeable, that I know\nnot what name to give its singular impression: but the sentiment of\nconsciousness of its belonging to my supremely beloved youth, gave me\nso pleasing an agitation, and worked so strongly on my soul, that it sent\nall its sensitive spirits to that organ of bliss in me, dedicated to its\nreception. There, concentering to a point, like rays in a burning glass,\nthey glowed, they burnt with the intensest heat; the springs of\npleasure were, in short, wound up to such a pitch, I panted now with so\nexquisitely keen an appetite for the eminent enjoyment, that I was even\nsick with desire, and unequal to support the combination of two distinct\nideas, that delightfully distracted me: for all the thought I was\ncapable of, was that I was now in touch, at once, with the instrument\nof pleasure, and the great seal of love. Ideas that, mingling streams,\npoured such an ocean of intoxicating bliss on a weak vessel, all too\nnarrow to contain it, that I lay overwhelmed, absorbed, lost in an abyss\nof joy, and dying of nothing but immoderate delight.\n\nCharles then roused me somewhat out of this extatic distraction, with\na complaint softly murmured, amidst a crowd of kisses, at the position,\nnot so favourable to his desires, in which I received his urgent\ninsistance for admission, where that insistance was alone so engrossing\na pleasure, that it made me inconsistently suffer a much dearer one to\nbe kept out; but how sweet to correct such a mistake! My thighs, now\nobedient to the intimations of love and nature, gladly disclose, and\nwith a ready submission, resign up the soft gateway to the entrance of\npleasure: I see, I feel the delicious velvet tip!... he enters me might\nand main, with... oh! my pen drops from here in the extasy now present\nto my faithful memory! Description too deserts me, and delivers over a\ntask, above its strength of wing, to the imagination: but it must be an\nimagination exalted by such a flame as mine that can do justice to that\nsweetest, noblest of all sensations, that hailed and accompanied\nthe stiff insinuation all the way up, till it was at the end of its\npenetration, sending up, through my eyes, the sparks of the love-fire\nthat ran all over me and blazed in every vein and every pore of me; a\nsystem incarnate of joy all over.\n\nI had now totally taken in love's true arrow from the point up to\nthe feather, in that part, where making no new wound, the lips or the\noriginal one of nature, which had owed its first breathing to this dear\ninstrument, clung, as if sensible of gratitude, in eager suction round\nit, whilst all its inwards embraced it tenderly, with a warmth of gust,\na compressive energy, that gave it, in its way, the heartiest welcome\nin nature; every fibre there gathering tight round it, and straining\nambitiously to come in for its share of the blissful touch.\n\nAs we were giving them a few moments pause to the the delectations of\nthe senses, in dwelling with the highest relish on this intimatest point\nof re-union, and chewing the cud of enjoyment, the impatience natural to\nthe pleasure soon drove us into action. Then began the driving tumult\non his side, and the responsive heaves on mine, which kept me up to\nhim; whilst, as our joys grew too great for utterance, the organs of\nour voices, voluptuously intermixing, became organs of the touch... how\ndelicious!... how poignantly luscious!... And now! now I felt, to the\nheart of me! I felt the prodigious keen edge, with which love, presiding\nover this act, points the pleasure: love! that may be styled the Attic\nsalt of enjoyment; and indeed, without it, the joy, great as it is,\nis still a vulgar one, whether in a king or a beggar; for it is,\nundoubtedly, love alone that refines, ennobles, and exalts it.\n\nThus, happy, then, by the heart, happy by the senses, it was beyond all\npower, even of thought, to form the conception of a greater delight than\nwhat I now am consummating the fruition of.\n\nCharles, whose whole frame was convulsed with the agitation of his\nrapture, whilst the tenderest fires trembled in his eyes, all assured me\nof a perfect concord of joy, penetrated me so profoundly, touched me\nso vitally, took me so much out of my own possession, whilst he seemed\nhimself so much in mine, that in a delicious enthusiasm, I imagined such\na transfusion of heart and spirit, as that coalescing, and making one\nbody and soul with him, I was he, and he me.\n\nBut all this pleasure tending, like life from its first instants,\ntowards its own dissolution, lived too fast not to bring on upon the\nspur its delicious moment of mortality; for presently the approach\nof the tender agony discovered itself by its usual signals, that were\nquickly followed by my dear lover's emanation of himself, that spun out,\nand shot, feelingly indeed! up the ravished indraught: where the sweetly\nsoothing balmy titillation opened all the juices of joy on my side,\nwhich extatic-ally in flow helped to allay the prurient glow, and\ndrowned our pleasure for a while. Soon, however, to be on float\nagain! for Charles, true to nature's laws, in one breath, expiring\nand ejaculating, languished not long in the dissolving trance, but\nrecovering spirit again, soon gave me to feel that the true mettle\nspring! of his instrument of pleasure, were, by love, and perhaps, by a\nlong vacation, wound up too high to be let down by a single explosion:\nhis stiffnesss till stood my friend. Resuming then the action afresh,\nwithout dislodging, or giving me the trouble of parting from my sweet\ntenant, we played over again the same opera, with the same harmony and\nconcert: our ardours, like our love, knew no remission; and all the\ntide serving my lover, lavish of his stores, and pleasure-milked, he\nover-flowed me once more from the fulness of his oval reservoirs of the\ngenial emulsion: whilst, on my side, a convulsive grasp, in the\ninstant of my giving down the liquid contribution, rendered me sweetly\nsubservient at once to the increase of joy, and to its effusions:\nmoving me so, as to make me exert all those springs of the compressive\nexsuction, with which the sensitive mechanism of that part thirstily\ndraws and drains the nipple of Love; with much such an instinctive\neagerness and attachment, as to compare great with less, kind nature\nengages infants at the breasts, by the pleasure they find in the motion\nof their little mouths and cheeks, to extract the milky stream prepared\nfor their nourishment.\n\nBut still there was no end of his vigour: this double discharge had so\nfar from extinguished his desires, for that time, that it had not even\ncalmed them; and at his age, desires are power. He was proceeding then\namazingly to push it to a third triumph, still without uncasing, if a\ntenderness, natural to true love, had not inspired me with self-denial\nenough to spare, and not over-strain him: and accordingly, entreating\nhim to give himself and me quarter, I obtained, at length, a short\nsuspension of arms, but not before he had exult-ingly satisfied me that\nhe gave out standing.\n\nThe remainder of the night, with what we borrowed upon the day, we\nemployed with unwearied fervour in celebrating thus the festival of our\nremeeting; and got up pretty late in the morning, gay, brisk and alert,\nthough rest had been a stranger to us: but the pleasures of love had\nbeen to us, what the joy of victory is to an army: repose, refreshment,\nevery thing.\n\nThe journey into the country being now entirely out of the question, and\norders having been given overnight for turning the horses' heads towards\nLondon, we left the inn as soon as we had breakfasted, not without a\nliberal distribution of the tokens of my grateful sense of the happiness\nI had met with in it.\n\nCharles and I were in my coach; the captain and my companion in a chaise\nhired purposely for them, to leave us the conveniency of a tete a tete.\n\nHere, on the road, as the tumult of my senses was tolerably composed, I\nhad command enough of head to break properly to his the course of life\nthat the consequences of my separation from him had driven me into:\nwhich, at the same time that he tenderly deplored with me, he was the\nless shocked at; as, on reflecting how he had left me circumstances, he\ncould not be entirely unprepared for it.\n\nBut when I opened the state of my fortune to him, and with that\nsincerity which, from me to him, was so much a nature in me, I beged\nof him his acceptance of it, on his own terms. I should appear to you\nperhaps too partial to my passion, were I to attempt the doing his\ndelicacy justice, I shall content myself then with assuring you, that\nafter his flatly refusing the unreserved, unconditional donation that I\nlong persecuted him in vain to accept, it was at length, in obedience to\nhis serious commands (for I stood out unaffectedly, till he exerted the\nsovereign authority which love had given him over me), that I yielded my\nconsent to waive the remonstrance I did not fail of making strongly\nto him, against his degrading himself, and incurring the reflection,\nhowever unjust, of having, for respects of fortune, bartered his honour\nfor infamy and prostitution, in making one his wife, who thought herself\ntoo much honoured in being but his mistress.\n\nThe plea of love then over-ruling all objections, for him, which he\ncould not but read the sincerity of in a heart ever open to him, obliged\nme to receive his hand, by which means I was in pass, among other\ninnumerable blessings, to bestow a legal parentage on those fine\nchildren you have seen by this happiest of matches.\n\nThus, at length, I got snug into port, where, in the bosom of virtue, I\ngathered the only uncorrupt sweets: where, looking back on the course\nof vice I had run, and comparing its infamous blandishments with the\ninfinitely superior joys of innocence, I could not help pitying, even in\npoint of taste, those who, immersed in gross sensuality, are insensible\nto the so delicate charms of VIRTUE, than which even PLEASURE has not\na greater friend, nor VICE a greater enemy. Thus temperance makes men\nlords over those pleasures that intemperance enslaves them to: the\none, parent of health, vigour fertility cheerfulness, and every other\ndesirable good of life; the other, of diseases, debility, barrenness,\nself-loathing, with only every evil incident to human nature.\n\nYou laugh, perhaps, at this tail-piece of morality, extracted from me by\nthe force of truth, resulting from compared experiences: you think\nit, no doubt, out of character; possibly too you may look on it as the\npaultry finesse of one who seeks to mask a devotee to vice under a rag\nof a veil, impudently smuggled from the shrine of Virtue: just as if one\nwas to fancy one's self completely disguised at a masquerade, with no\nother change of dress than turning one's shoes into slippers; or, as if\na writer should think to shield a treasonable libel, by concluding it\nwith a formal prayer for the King. But, independent of my flattering\nmyself that you have a juster opinion of my sense and sincerity, give\nme leave to represent to you, that such a supposition is even more\ninjurious to Virtue than to me: since, consistently with candour and\ngood nature, it san have no foundation but in the falsest of fears, that\nits pleasures cannot stand in comparison with those of Vice; but let\ntruth dare to hold it up in its most alluring light: then mark, how\nspurious, how low of taste, how comparatively inferior its joys are to\nthose which Virtue gives sanction to, and whose sentiments are not above\nmaking even a sauce for the senses, but a sauce of the highest relish;\nwhilst Vices are the harpies that infect and foul the feast. The paths\nof Vice are sometimes strewed with roses, but then they are for ever\ninfamous for many a thorn, for many a cankerworm: those of Virtue are\nstrewed with roses purely, and those eternally unfading ones.\n\nIf you do me then justice, you will esteem me perfectly consistent in\nthe incense I burn to Virtue. If I have painted Vice in all its gayest\ncolours, if I have decked it with flowers, it has been solely in order\nto make the worthier, the solemner sacrifice of it to Virtue.\n\nYou know Mr. C*** O***, you know his estate, his worth, and good sense:\ncan you, will you pronounce it ill meant, at least of him, when anxious\nfor his son's morals, with a view to form him to virtue, and inspire him\nwith a fixed, a rational contempt for vice, he condescended to be his\nmaster of the ceremonies, and led him by the hand through the most noted\nbawdy-houses in town, where he took care he should be familiarized with\nall those scenes of debauchery, so fit to nauseate a good taste? The\nexperiment, you will cry, is dangerous. True, on a fool: but are fools\nworth so much attention.\n\nI shall see you soon, and in the mean time think candidly of me, and\nbelieve me ever,\n\nMADAM, Yours, etc., etc., etc. X X X.\n\n\n     THE END", "title": "Memoirs Of Fanny Hill"}
