{"summary": "\nNote: Book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book.\n(1) After an invocation to the Muses, the story launches in medias res (in the middle of things) towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging Greeks. Chryses, a Trojan priest of Apollo, offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter Chryseis, a captive of Agamemnon, the Greek leader. Although most of the Greek army is in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chryses prays for Apollo's help, and Apollo causes a plague throughout the Greek army.\nAfter nine days of plague, Achilles, the leader of the Myrmidon contingent, calls an assembly to solve the plague problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father, but also decides to take Achilles's captive, Briseis, as compensation. Angered, Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon, but will go home. Odysseus takes a ship and brings Chryseis to her father, whereupon Apollo ends the plague.\nIn the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles then became very upset, sat by the seashore and prayed for his mother. Achilles then asks his mother, Thetis, to ask Zeus that the Greeks be brought to breaking point by the Trojans, so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees.\n(2) Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack the city. Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the morale of the Greek army by telling them to go home. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired by Athena, stops a rout.\nOdysseus confronts and beats Thersites, a common soldier who voices discontent at fighting Agamemnon's war. After a meal, the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. The poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each Greek contingent. When news of the Greek deployment reaches king Priam, the Trojans too sortie upon the plain. In a similar list to that for the Greeks, the poet describes the Trojans and their allies.\n(3) The armies approach each other on the plain, but before they meet, Paris offers to end the war by fighting a duel with Menelaus, urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, Hector. While Helen tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, but Aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus could kill him.\n(4) Pressured by Hera's hatred of Troy, Zeus arranges for the Trojan Pandaros to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow. Agamemnon rouses the Greeks, and battle is joined.\n(5) In the fighting, Diomedes kills many Trojans, including Pandaros, and defeats Aeneas, whom again Aphrodite rescues, but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess. Apollo faces Diomedes, and warns him against warring with gods. Many heroes and commanders join in, including Hector, and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds Ares and puts him out of action.\n(6) Hector rallies the Trojans and stops a rout; the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan Glaukos find common ground and exchange unequal gifts. Hector enters the city, urges prayers and sacrifices, incites Paris to battle, bids his wife Andromache and son Astyanax farewell on the city walls, and rejoins the battle.\n(7) Hector duels with Ajax, but nightfall interrupts the fight and both sides retire. The Greeks agree to burn their dead and build a wall to protect their ships and camp, while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen. Paris offers to return the treasure he took, and give further wealth as compensation, but without returning Helen, and the offer is refused. A day's truce is agreed for burning the dead, during which the Greeks also build their wall and trench.\n(8) The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall while Hera and Athena are forbidden from helping. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Greek wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.\n\n(9) Meanwhile, the Greeks are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error, and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, Phoenix, and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, who has been camped next to his ships throughout, if only he would return to the fighting. Achilles and his companion Patroclus receive the embassy well, but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon's offer, and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reach his ships and threaten them with fire. The embassy returns empty-handed.\n(10) Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, killing the Trojan Dolon and wreaking havoc in the camps of some Thracian allies of Troy.\n(11) In the morning, the fighting is fierce and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties, and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of Nestor.\n(12) The Trojans assault the Greek wall on foot. Hector, ignoring an omen, leads the terrible fighting. The Greeks are overwhelmed in rout, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in.\n(13) Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seer Polydamas urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles, but is ignored.\n(14) Hera seduces Zeus and lures him to sleep, allowing Poseidon to help the Greeks, and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain.\n(15) Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. Against the mounting discontent of the Greek-supporting gods, Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans, who once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.\n(16) Patroclus can't stand to watch any longer, and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships. Achilles relents, and lends Patroclus his armor, but sends him off with a stern admonition not to pursue the Trojans, lest he take Achilles's glory. Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing the Trojan hero Sarpedon. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles's command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and Euphorbos, and is finally killed by Hector.\n(17) Hector takes Achilles's armor from the fallen Patroclus, but fighting develops around Patroclus' body.\n(18) Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus's death, and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus' body, but has no armour. Made brilliant by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus' body away. Again Polydamas urges Hector to withdraw into the city, again Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp in the plain at nightfall. Patroclus is mourned, and meanwhile, at Thetis' request, Hephaestus fashions a new set of armor for Achilles, among which is a magnificently wrought shield.\n(19) In the morning, Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, including Briseis, but he is indifferent to them. Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal, and straps on his new armor, and heaves his great spear. His horse Xanthos prophesies to Achilles his death. Achilles drives his chariot into battle.\n(20) Zeus lifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely intervene on both sides. The onslaught of Achilles, burning with rage and grief, is terrible, and he slays many.\n(21) Driving the Trojans before him, Achilles cuts off half their number in the river Skamandros and proceeds to slaughter them and fills the river with the dead. The river, angry at the killing, confronts Achilles, but is beaten back by Hephaestus' firestorm. The gods fight among themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan.\n(22) When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans had retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels the shame of rout and resolves to face Achilles, in spite of the pleas of Priam and Hecuba, his parents. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him to stop running, and he turns to face his opponent. After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck. Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he is fated to die in the war as well. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it.\n(23) The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream and urges the burial of his body. The Greeks hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.\n(24) Dismayed by Achilles' continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led by Hermes, Priam takes a wagon out of Troy, across the plains, and enters the Greek camp unnoticed. He grasps Achilles by the knees and begs to have his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears, and the two lament their losses in the war. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns.\n\n", "full_text": "THE ILIAD OF HOMER\n\n\n  Rendered into English Prose for\n  the use of those who cannot\n  read the original\n\n\nby\n\nSamuel Butler\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I\n\n  The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles--Achilles withdraws\n  from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help\n  the Trojans--Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus.\n\nSing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought\ncountless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send\nhurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and\nvultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on\nwhich the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell\nout with one another.\n\nAnd which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the\nson of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a\npestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of\nAtreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the\nships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had brought with him a\ngreat ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo\nwreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but\nmost of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their chiefs.\n\n\"Sons of Atreus,\" he cried, \"and all other Achaeans, may the gods who\ndwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your\nhomes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in\nreverence to Apollo, son of Jove.\"\n\nOn this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the\npriest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who\nspoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. \"Old man,\" said he,\n\"let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming\nhereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you\nnothing. I will not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos\nfar from her own home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my\ncouch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.\"\n\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the\nshore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely\nLeto had borne. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might,\nhear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with\ngarlands, or burned your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my\nprayer, and let your arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious\nfrom the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his\nshoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that\ntrembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a\nface as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his\narrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their\nhounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and\nall day long the pyres of the dead were burning.\n\nFor nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon the\ntenth day Achilles called them in assembly--moved thereto by Juno, who\nsaw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them.\nThen, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.\n\n\"Son of Atreus,\" said he, \"I deem that we should now turn roving home\nif we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and\npestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader\nof dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus\nApollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have\nbroken, or hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will\naccept the savour of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take\naway the plague from us.\"\n\nWith these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of\naugurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He it\nwas who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the\nprophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all\nsincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus:--\n\n\"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger of King\nApollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that you\nwill stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall\noffend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans\nare in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a\nking, who if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge\ntill he has wreaked it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will\nprotect me.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you\nfrom heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose\noracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand\nupon you, while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth--no, not\nthough you name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the\nAchaeans.\"\n\nThereon the seer spoke boldly. \"The god,\" he said, \"is angry neither\nabout vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon has\ndishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom\nfor her; therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send\nothers. He will not deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till\nAgamemnon has restored the girl without fee or ransom to her father,\nand has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease\nhim.\"\n\nWith these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart\nwas black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas\nand said, \"Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things\nconcerning me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You\nhave brought me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come\nseeing among Danaans, and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I\nwould not take a ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have\nset my heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even\nthan my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form and\nfeature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will give her up\nif I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you must find\nme a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without one.\nThis is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is to go\nelsewhither.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all\nmankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no\ncommon store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have\nbeen awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made\nalready. Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants\nus to sack the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold.\"\n\nThen Agamemnon said, \"Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not\nthus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me.\nAre you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and\ngive up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in\nfair exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that\nof Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my\ncoming. But of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present,\nlet us draw a ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let\nus put a hecatomb on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let\nsome chief man among us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or\nyourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer\nsacrifice and appease the anger of the god.\"\n\nAchilles scowled at him and answered, \"You are steeped in insolence and\nlust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding,\neither on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any\nill the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not\nraided my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich\nplains of Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both\nmountain and sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for\nyour pleasure, not ours--to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your\nshameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob\nme of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons of the\nAchaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of\nthe Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though it is my\nhands that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes,\nyour share is far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my\nships, take what I can get and be thankful, when my labour of fighting\nis done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to Phthia; it will be much\nbetter for me to return home with my ships, for I will not stay here\ndishonoured to gather gold and substance for you.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers\nto stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all\nJove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as\nyou are, for you are ever quarrelsome and ill-affected. What though you\nbe brave? Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with your\nships and comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for\nyou nor for your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is\ntaking Chryseis from me, I shall send her with my ship and my\nfollowers, but I shall come to your tent and take your own prize\nBriseis, that you may learn how much stronger I am than you are, and\nthat another may fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.\"\n\nThe son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy breast\nwas divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and kill\nthe son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While he\nwas thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its\nscabbard, Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her in the\nlove she bore to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow\nhair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her.\nAchilles turned in amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at\nonce knew that she was Minerva. \"Why are you here,\" said he, \"daughter\nof aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?\nLet me tell you--and it shall surely be--he shall pay for this\ninsolence with his life.\"\n\nAnd Minerva said, \"I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to bid you\nstay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.\nCease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if\nyou will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you--and it\nshall surely be--that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as\nsplendid by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and obey.\"\n\n\"Goddess,\" answered Achilles, \"however angry a man may be, he must do\nas you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the\nprayers of him who has obeyed them.\"\n\nHe stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it back\ninto the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to Olympus\namong the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing Jove.\n\nBut the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus, for he\nwas still in a rage. \"Wine-bibber,\" he cried, \"with the face of a dog\nand the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in\nfight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you\ndo death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from any\nman who contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over\na feeble folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult\nno man. Therefore I say, and swear it with a great oath--nay, by this\nmy sceptre which shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from\nthe day on which it left its parent stem upon the mountains--for the\naxe stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear\nit as judges and guardians of the decrees of heaven--so surely and\nsolemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall look fondly for Achilles\nand shall not find him. In the day of your distress, when your men fall\ndying by the murderous hand of Hector, you shall not know how to help\nthem, and shall rend your heart with rage for the hour when you offered\ninsult to the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on the\nground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning\nfiercely from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued\nNestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his\nlips sweeter than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos\nhad passed away under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third.\nWith all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\n\n\"Of a truth,\" he said, \"a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean land.\nSurely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad at\nheart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so\nexcellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you;\ntherefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of\nmen even greater than you are, and they did not disregard my counsels.\nNever again can I behold such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of\nhis people, or as Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son\nof Aegeus, peer of the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever\nborn upon this earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the\nfiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came\nfrom distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would have me\ncome, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now living could\nwithstand them, but they heard my words, and were persuaded by them. So\nbe it also with yourselves, for this is the more excellent way.\nTherefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not this girl away,\nfor the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to Achilles; and\nyou, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man who by the\ngrace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You are\nstrong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger\nthan you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your\nanger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of\nbattle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, all that you have said is true, but this\nfellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all,\nking of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that\nthe gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the\nright to speak with railing?\"\n\nAchilles interrupted him. \"I should be a mean coward,\" he cried, \"were\nI to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not me,\nfor I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say--and lay my saying to\nyour heart--I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for\nthose that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at\nmy ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may\nsee; if you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood.\"\n\nWhen they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up the\nassembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back to\nhis tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while\nAgamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty\noarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for\nthe god. And Ulysses went as captain.\n\nThese, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea. But the\nson of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified\nthemselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered\nhecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the\nsmoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven.\n\nThus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon did\nnot forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty\nmessengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. \"Go,\" said he, \"to the\ntent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her\nhither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and take\nher--which will press him harder.\"\n\nHe charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon they\nwent their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents\nand ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and\nhis ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood\nfearfully and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak,\nbut he knew them and said, \"Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and\nmen; draw near; my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has\nsent you for the girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give\nher to them, but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal\nmen, and by the fierceness of Agamemnon's anger, that if ever again\nthere be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek and\nthey shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how to\nlook before and after that the Achaeans may fight by their ships in\nsafety.\"\n\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis\nfrom the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them\nto the ships of the Achaeans--and the woman was loth to go. Then\nAchilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and\nlooking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in\nprayer to his immortal mother, \"Mother,\" he cried, \"you bore me doomed\nto live but for a little season; surely Jove, who thunders from\nOlympus, might have made that little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon,\nson of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by\nforce.\"\n\nAs he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was\nsitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.\nForthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down\nbefore him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said,\n\"My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not\nfrom me, but tell me, that we may know it together.\"\n\nAchilles drew a deep sigh and said, \"You know it; why tell you what you\nknow well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion, sacked\nit, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared it\nduly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of\nAgamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the\nAchaeans to free his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom:\nmoreover he bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a\nsuppliant's wreath, and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the\ntwo sons of Atreus who were their chiefs.\n\n\"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting\nthe priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,\nwho spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in\nanger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god\nsent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick on one\nanother, for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the\nAchaeans. At last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us\nthe oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should\nappease him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened\nthat which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a\nship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the\nheralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the\nAchaeans had awarded to myself.\n\n\"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus, and if\nyou have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid of\nJove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory in that you\nalone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the\nothers, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in\nbonds. It was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the\nhundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he\nis stronger even than his father; when therefore he took his seat\nall-glorious beside the son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and\ndid not bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp his\nknees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be\nhemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the sea-shore,\nthat they may reap what joy they may of their king, and that Agamemnon\nmay rue his blindness in offering insult to the foremost of the\nAchaeans.\"\n\nThetis wept and answered, \"My son, woe is me that I should have borne\nor suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from all\nsorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should be\nat once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe,\ntherefore, was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will go to\nthe snowy heights of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will\nhear our prayer: meanwhile stay where you are with your ships, nurse\nyour anger against the Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For Jove\nwent yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the\nother gods went with him. He will return to Olympus twelve days hence;\nI will then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will beseech him;\nnor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.\"\n\nOn this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had been\ntaken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.\nWhen they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid\nthem in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast\ninto its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would have\nher lie; there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the\nhawsers. They then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb\nfor Apollo; Chryseis also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the\naltar to deliver her into the hands of her father. \"Chryses,\" said he,\n\"King Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and to offer\nsacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate\nthe god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.\"\n\nSo saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her gladly,\nand they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of the\ngod. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle\nover the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on\ntheir behalf. \"Hear me,\" he cried, \"O god of the silver bow, that\nprotectest Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might.\nEven as thou didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press\nhardly upon the Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful\npestilence from the Danaans.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done\npraying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the\nvictims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones,\nwrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on\nthe top of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and poured\nwine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\nspits in their hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had\ntasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces\nupon the spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off:\nthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\nate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the\nmixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving every\nman his drink-offering.\n\nThus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning\nhim and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their\nvoices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid\nthemselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the\nchild of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for\nthe host of the Achaeans. Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised\ntheir mast and hoisted their white sails aloft. As the sail bellied\nwith the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam\nhissed against her bows as she sped onward. When they reached the\nwide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel ashore, high\nand dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath her, and went\ntheir ways to their own tents and ships.\n\nBut Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not to\nthe honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed at\nhis own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.\n\nNow after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to Olympus,\nand Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her son\nhad laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through\ngreat heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty\nson of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat\nherself down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while\nwith her right she caught him under the chin, and besought him,\nsaying:--\n\n\"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the\nimmortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to be\ncut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his\nprize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of\ncounsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give my\nson his due and load him with riches in requital.\"\n\nJove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still kept\nfirm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. \"Incline your\nhead,\" said she, \"and promise me surely, or else deny me--for you have\nnothing to fear--that I may learn how greatly you disdain me.\"\n\nAt this Jove was much troubled and answered, \"I shall have trouble if\nyou set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with her\ntaunting speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the\nother gods and accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now,\nlest she should find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it\nabout as you wish. See, I incline my head that you may believe me. This\nis the most solemn promise that I can give to any god. I never recall\nmy word, or deceive, or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my\nhead.\"\n\nAs he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial\nlocks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus reeled.\n\nWhen the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted--Jove to his\nhouse, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged\ninto the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the\ncoming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all\nstood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But\nJuno, when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter,\nsilver-footed Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began\nto upbraid him. \"Trickster,\" she cried, \"which of the gods have you\nbeen taking into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in\nsecret behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help\nit, one word of your intentions.\"\n\n\"Juno,\" replied the sire of gods and men, \"you must not expect to be\ninformed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find it\nhard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is no\none, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a\nmatter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions.\"\n\n\"Dread son of Saturn,\" answered Juno, \"what are you talking about? I?\nPry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in\neverything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman's\ndaughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was with you and had\nhold of your knees this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that\nyou have been promising her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much\npeople at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\n\"Wife,\" said Jove, \"I can do nothing but you suspect me and find it\nout. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the\nmore, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I\nmean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I\nonce begin to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your\nside it would profit you nothing.\"\n\nOn this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and sat\ndown in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout the\nhouse of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify\nhis mother Juno. \"It will be intolerable,\" said he, \"if you two fall to\nwrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If\nsuch ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our\nbanquet. Let me then advise my mother--and she must herself know that\nit will be better--to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he\nagain scold her and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants\nto hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far the\nstrongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a good\nhumour with us.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his\nmother's hand. \"Cheer up, my dear mother,\" said he, \"and make the best\nof it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a\nthrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not help, for there is\nno standing against Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you, he\ncaught me by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day\nlong from morn till eve, was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground\nin the island of Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in\nme, till the Sintians came and tended me.\"\n\nJuno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her son's\nhands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served\nit round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods\nlaughed out a loud applause as they saw him bustling about the heavenly\nmansion.\n\nThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they\nfeasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\nApollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices,\ncalling and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious light\nhad faded, they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame\nVulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the\nOlympian Lord of Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept;\nand when he had got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden\nthrone by his side.\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n  Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the\n  chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his\n  army--In the end they march to fight--Catalogue of the\n  Achaean and Trojan forces.\n\nNow the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept soundly,\nbut Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honour to Achilles,\nand destroyed much people at the ships of the Achaeans. In the end he\ndeemed it would be best to send a lying dream to King Agamemnon; so he\ncalled one to him and said to it, \"Lying Dream, go to the ships of the\nAchaeans, into the tent of Agamemnon, and say to him word for word as I\nnow bid you. Tell him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he\nshall take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods;\nJuno has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.\"\n\nThe dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached the\nships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and found him\nin his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered over his head in\nthe likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom Agamemnon honoured above\nall his councillors, and said:--\n\n\"You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host\nand so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear\nme at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not\nnear, yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the\nAchaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are no\nlonger divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them over to\nher own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of Jove.\nRemember this, and when you wake see that it does not escape you.\"\n\nThe dream then left him, and he thought of things that were, surely not\nto be accomplished. He thought that on that same day he was to take the\ncity of Priam, but he little knew what was in the mind of Jove, who had\nmany another hard-fought fight in store alike for Danaans and Trojans.\nThen presently he woke, with the divine message still ringing in his\nears; so he sat upright, and put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and\nover this his heavy cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,\nand slung his silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took\nthe imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships of\nthe Achaeans.\n\nThe goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she might\nherald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and Agamemnon sent the\ncriers round to call the people in assembly; so they called them and\nthe people gathered thereon. But first he summoned a meeting of the\nelders at the ship of Nestor king of Pylos, and when they were\nassembled he laid a cunning counsel before them.\n\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"I have had a dream from heaven in the dead of\nnight, and its face and figure resembled none but Nestor's. It hovered\nover my head and said, 'You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has\nthe welfare of his host and so much other care upon his shoulders\nshould dock his sleep. Hear me at once, for I am a messenger from Jove,\nwho, though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you.\nHe bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take\nTroy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has\nbrought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the\nhands of Jove. Remember this.' The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let\nus now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well\nthat I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them to fly\nwith their ships; but do you others go about among the host and prevent\ntheir doing so.\"\n\nHe then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all sincerity and\ngoodwill addressed them thus: \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and\ncouncillors of the Argives, if any other man of the Achaeans had told\nus of this dream we should have declared it false, and would have had\nnothing to do with it. But he who has seen it is the foremost man among\nus; we must therefore set about getting the people under arms.\"\n\nWith this he led the way from the assembly, and the other sceptred\nkings rose with him in obedience to the word of Agamemnon; but the\npeople pressed forward to hear. They swarmed like bees that sally from\nsome hollow cave and flit in countless throng among the spring flowers,\nbunched in knots and clusters; even so did the mighty multitude pour\nfrom ships and tents to the assembly, and range themselves upon the\nwide-watered shore, while among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of\nJove, urging them ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell\nof mad confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the\npeople sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among them\nto stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till at last\nthey were got into their several places and ceased their clamour. Then\nKing Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was the work of Vulcan,\nwho gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove gave it to Mercury, slayer\nof Argus, guide and guardian. King Mercury gave it to Pelops, the\nmighty charioteer, and Pelops to Atreus, shepherd of his people.\nAtreus, when he died, left it to Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes\nin his turn left it to be borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of\nall Argos and of the isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed\nthe Argives.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said, \"heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of heaven\nhas been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise\nthat I should sack the city of Priam before returning, but he has\nplayed me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to Argos\nwith the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who has laid\nmany a proud city in the dust, as he will yet lay others, for his power\nis above all. It will be a sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host,\nat once so great and valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in\nnumber than themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that\nthe Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that they\nhave each been numbered--the Trojans by the roll of their householders,\nand we by companies of ten; think further that each of our companies\ndesired to have a Trojan householder to pour out their wine; we are so\ngreatly more in number that full many a company would have to go\nwithout its cup-bearer. But they have in the town allies from other\nplaces, and it is these that hinder me from being able to sack the rich\ncity of Ilius. Nine of Jove's years are gone; the timbers of our ships\nhave rotted; their tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little\nones at home look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came\nhither to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say:\nlet us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.\"\n\nWith these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of them\nas knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to and fro\nlike the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and south winds break\nfrom heaven's clouds to lash them; or as when the west wind sweeps over\na field of corn and the ears bow beneath the blast, even so were they\nswayed as they flew with loud cries towards the ships, and the dust\nfrom under their feet rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to\ndraw the ships into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of\nthem; they began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the\nwelkin rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return.\n\nThen surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that was\nnot fated. But Juno said to Minerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing\nJove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over\nthe broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still\nkeeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at\nTroy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host, and speak\nfairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their ships into the\nsea.\"\n\nMinerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the\ntopmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships of the\nAchaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, standing\nalone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his ship, for he was grieved\nand sorry; so she went close up to him and said, \"Ulysses, noble son of\nLaertes, are you going to fling yourselves into your ships and be off\nhome to your own land in this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans\nthe glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the\nAchaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once\namong the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw\nnot their ships into the sea.\"\n\nUlysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak from\nhim and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of Ithaca, who\nwaited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon Ulysses went straight\nup to Agamemnon and received from him his ancestral, imperishable\nstaff. With this he went about among the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nWhenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke him\nfairly. \"Sir,\" said he, \"this flight is cowardly and unworthy. Stand to\nyour post, and bid your people also keep their places. You do not yet\nknow the full mind of Agamemnon; he was sounding us, and ere long will\nvisit the Achaeans with his displeasure. We were not all of us at the\ncouncil to hear what he then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us\na mischief; for the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is\nwith them.\"\n\nBut when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he\nstruck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, \"Sirrah, hold your\npeace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a coward and no\nsoldier; you are nobody either in fight or council; we cannot all be\nkings; it is not well that there should be many masters; one man must\nbe supreme--one king to whom the son of scheming Saturn has given the\nsceptre of sovereignty over you all.\"\n\nThus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people hurried\nback to the council from their tents and ships with a sound as the\nthunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the shore, and all the\nsea is in an uproar.\n\nThe rest now took their seats and kept to their own several places, but\nThersites still went on wagging his unbridled tongue--a man of many\nwords, and those unseemly; a monger of sedition, a railer against all\nwho were in authority, who cared not what he said, so that he might set\nthe Achaeans in a laugh. He was the ugliest man of all those that came\nbefore Troy--bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders\nrounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point, but\nthere was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses hated him\nworst of all, for it was with them that he was most wont to wrangle;\nnow, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he began heaping his abuse on\nAgamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and disgusted, yet none the less he\nkept on brawling and bawling at the son of Atreus.\n\n\"Agamemnon,\" he cried, \"what ails you now, and what more do you want?\nYour tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for whenever we\ntake a town we give you the pick of them. Would you have yet more gold,\nwhich some Trojan is to give you as a ransom for his son, when I or\nanother Achaean has taken him prisoner? or is it some young girl to\nhide and lie with? It is not well that you, the ruler of the Achaeans,\nshould bring them into such misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than\nmen, let us sail home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in\nhis own meeds of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to\nhim or no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he has\ntreated him--robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself. Achilles\ntakes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of Atreus, you would\nnever again insult him.\"\n\nThus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and rebuked\nhim sternly. \"Check your glib tongue, Thersites,\" said be, \"and babble\nnot a word further. Chide not with princes when you have none to back\nyou. There is no viler creature come before Troy with the sons of\nAtreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and neither revile them nor keep\nharping about going home. We do not yet know how things are going to\nbe, nor whether the Achaeans are to return with good success or evil.\nHow dare you gibe at Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so\nmany prizes? I tell you, therefore--and it shall surely be--that if I\nagain catch you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own\nhead and be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will take you,\nstrip you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly till you go\nblubbering back to the ships.\"\n\nOn this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders till he\ndropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a bloody weal on\nhis back, so he sat down frightened and in pain, looking foolish as he\nwiped the tears from his eyes. The people were sorry for him, yet they\nlaughed heartily, and one would turn to his neighbour saying, \"Ulysses\nhas done many a good thing ere now in fight and council, but he never\ndid the Argives a better turn than when he stopped this fellow's mouth\nfrom prating further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.\"\n\nThus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and Minerva\nin the likeness of a herald bade the people be still, that those who\nwere far off might hear him and consider his council. He therefore with\nall sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus:--\n\n\"King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among all\nmankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set out from\nArgos, that you should not return till you had sacked the town of Troy,\nand, like children or widowed women, they murmur and would set off\nhomeward. True it is that they have had toil enough to be disheartened.\nA man chafes at having to stay away from his wife even for a single\nmonth, when he is on shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is\nnow nine long years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore,\nblame the Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we\ngo home empty after so long a stay--therefore, my friends, be patient\nyet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of\nCalchas were false or true.\n\n\"All who have not since perished must remember as though it were\nyesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were\ndetained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on Priam\nand the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain offering\nhecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there was a fine\nplane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of pure water. Then\nwe saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful serpent out of the ground,\nwith blood-red stains upon its back, and it darted from under the altar\non to the plane-tree. Now there was a brood of young sparrows, quite\nsmall, upon the topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight\nin all, and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate\nthe poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her\nlittle ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught her\nby the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten both the\nsparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him become a sign;\nfor the son of scheming Saturn turned him into stone, and we stood\nthere wondering at that which had come to pass. Seeing, then, that such\na fearful portent had broken in upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith\ndeclared to us the oracles of heaven. 'Why, Achaeans,' said he, 'are\nyou thus speechless? Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and\nlong ere it be fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the\nserpent ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them,\nwhich makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the\ntenth shall take the town.' This was what he said, and now it is all\ncoming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take the city of\nPriam.\"\n\nOn this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again with the\nuproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them. \"Shame on you,\"\nhe cried, \"to stay talking here like children, when you should fight\nlike men. Where are our covenants now, and where the oaths that we have\ntaken? Shall our counsels be flung into the fire, with our\ndrink-offerings and the right hands of fellowship wherein we have put\nour trust? We waste our time in words, and for all our talking here\nshall be no further forward. Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your\nown steadfast purpose; lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this\nhandful of men to rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to\nArgos ere they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the\nmighty son of Saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we\nArgives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans. He\nshowed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our right\nhands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain with\nthe wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has\nsuffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless, if any man is in such\nhaste to be at home again, let him lay his hand to his ship that he may\nmeet his doom in the sight of all. But, O king, consider and give ear\nto my counsel, for the word that I say may not be neglected lightly.\nDivide your men, Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that\nclans and tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and\nif the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and\npeoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie against the\nother. Thus you shall also learn whether it is through the counsel of\nheaven or the cowardice of man that you shall fail to take the town.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, you have again outdone the sons of the\nAchaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I\nhad among them ten more such councillors, for the city of King Priam\nwould then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it. But the\nson of Saturn afflicts me with bootless wranglings and strife. Achilles\nand I are quarrelling about this girl, in which matter I was the first\nto offend; if we can be of one mind again, the Trojans will not stave\noff destruction for a day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that\nour hosts join in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the\nordering of your shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your\nchariots carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we\nshall have no rest, not for a moment, till night falls to part us. The\nbands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat upon your\nshoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears, your horses shall\nsteam in front of your chariots, and if I see any man shirking the\nfight, or trying to keep out of it at the ships, there shall be no help\nfor him, but he shall be a prey to dogs and vultures.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the waves run\nhigh before the blast of the south wind and break on some lofty\nheadland, dashing against it and buffeting it without ceasing, as the\nstorms from every quarter drive them, even so did the Achaeans rise and\nhurry in all directions to their ships. There they lighted their fires\nat their tents and got dinner, offering sacrifice every man to one or\nother of the gods, and praying each one of them that he might live to\ncome out of the fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat\nfive-year-old bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited the princes\nand elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King Idomeneus, then\nthe two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Ulysses, peer of gods\nin counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord, for he knew how busy\nhis brother then was. They stood round the bull with the barley-meal in\ntheir hands, and Agamemnon prayed, saying, \"Jove, most glorious,\nsupreme, that dwellest in heaven, and ridest upon the storm-cloud,\ngrant that the sun may not go down, nor the night fall, till the palace\nof Priam is laid low, and its gates are consumed with fire. Grant that\nmy sword may pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and that full\nmany of his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.\"\n\nThus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his prayer. He\naccepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased their toil\ncontinually. When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley-meal\nupon the victim, they drew back its head, killed it, and then flayed\nit. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of\nfat, and set pieces of raw meat on the top of them. These they burned\nupon the split logs of firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, and\nheld them in the flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were burned, and\nthey had tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the\npieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew them off;\nthen, when they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they\nate it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied.\nAs soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, Nestor, knight of\nGerene, began to speak. \"King Agamemnon,\" said he, \"let us not stay\ntalking here, nor be slack in the work that heaven has put into our\nhands. Let the heralds summon the people to gather at their several\nships; we will then go about among the host, that we may begin fighting\nat once.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once sent the\ncriers round to call the people in assembly. So they called them, and\nthe people gathered thereon. The chiefs about the son of Atreus chose\ntheir men and marshalled them, while Minerva went among them holding\nher priceless aegis that knows neither age nor death. From it there\nwaved a hundred tassels of pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of\nthem worth a hundred oxen. With this she darted furiously everywhere\namong the hosts of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and putting\ncourage into the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle\nwithout ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than\nreturning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire is raging\nupon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as they marched\nthe gleam of their armour flashed up into the firmament of heaven.\n\nThey were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the plain\nabout the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and thither,\nglorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they settle till the fen\nis alive with their screaming. Even thus did their tribes pour from\nships and tents on to the plain of the Scamander, and the ground rang\nas brass under the feet of men and horses. They stood as thick upon the\nflower-bespangled field as leaves that bloom in summer.\n\nAs countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman's homestead in the\ntime of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even so did the\nAchaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans and destroy them.\n\nThe chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight began,\ndrafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their flocks when they\nhave got mixed while feeding; and among them went King Agamemnon, with\na head and face like Jove the lord of thunder, a waist like Mars, and a\nchest like that of Neptune. As some great bull that lords it over the\nherds upon the plain, even so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand\npeerless among the multitude of heroes.\n\nAnd now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell me--for you\nare goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things, while\nwe know nothing but by report--who were the chiefs and princes of the\nDanaans? As for the common soldiers, they were so that I could not name\nevery single one of them though I had ten tongues, and though my voice\nfailed not and my heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O\nOlympian Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them\nto me. Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the\nfleet together.\n\nPeneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains of\nthe Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and\nwho held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia,\nGraia, and the fair city of Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium,\nand Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the\nstrong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of\ndoves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the\nfortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of\nNeptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon\nthe sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in each there were a\nhundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.\n\nAscalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in\nAspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden\nbore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with\nMars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain with her. With\nthese there came thirty ships.\n\nThe Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty\nIphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus,\nrocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in\nAnemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters of the river Cephissus,\nand Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus; with their chieftains came\nforty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were\nstationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.\n\nAjax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so\ngreat, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little\nman, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use of the spear he\nexcelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus,\nOpous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae, Tarphe, and Thronium\nabout the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships of the\nLocrians who dwell beyond Euboea.\n\nThe fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,\nHistiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the rock-perched\ntown of Dium; with them were also the men of Carystus and Styra;\nElephenor of the race of Mars was in command of these; he was son of\nChalcodon, and chief over all the Abantes. With him they came, fleet of\nfoot and wearing their hair long behind, brave warriors, who would ever\nstrive to tear open the corslets of their foes with their long ashen\nspears. Of these there came fifty ships.\n\nAnd they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great\nErechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove's daughter,\nMinerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own rich\nsanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship him with\nsacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by Menestheus, son\nof Peteos. No man living could equal him in the marshalling of chariots\nand foot soldiers. Nestor could alone rival him, for he was older. With\nhim there came fifty ships.\n\nAjax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them alongside\nthose of the Athenians.\n\nThe men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns, with\nHermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the vineyard\nlands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who came from Aegina\nand Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud battle-cry, and\nSthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in command was Euryalus, son\nof king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but Diomed was chief over them all.\nWith these there came eighty ships.\n\nThose who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae;\nOrneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old;\nHyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coast-land\nround about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of\nKing Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far both finest and most\nnumerous, and in their midst was the king himself, all glorious in his\narmour of gleaming bronze--foremost among the heroes, for he was the\ngreatest king, and had most men under him.\n\nAnd those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills, Pharis,\nSparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae, Amyclae, and\nHelos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus; these were led by\nMenelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to Agamemnon, and of them\nthere were sixty ships, drawn up apart from the others. Among them went\nMenelaus himself, strong in zeal, urging his men to fight; for he\nlonged to avenge the toil and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake\nof Helen.\n\nThe men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the river\nAlpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum, Helos, and\nDorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his minstrelsy for\never. He was returning from Oechalia, where Eurytus lived and reigned,\nand boasted that he would surpass even the Muses, daughters of\naegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing against him; whereon they were\nangry, and maimed him. They robbed him of his divine power of song, and\nthenceforth he could strike the lyre no more. These were commanded by\nNestor, knight of Gerene, and with him there came ninety ships.\n\nAnd those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene, near\nthe tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand; the men of\nPheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of Rhipae, Stratie, and\nbleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of Stymphelus and Parrhasia;\nof these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus was commander, and they had sixty\nships. Many Arcadians, good soldiers, came in each one of them, but\nAgamemnon found them the ships in which to cross the sea, for they were\nnot a people that occupied their business upon the waters.\n\nThe men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is\nenclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock Olene\nand Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had ten ships,\nwith many Epeans on board. Their captains were Amphimachus and\nThalpius--the one, son of Cteatus, and the other, of Eurytus--both of\nthe race of Actor. The two others were Diores, son of Amarynces, and\nPolyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of Augeas.\n\nAnd those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who dwelt\nbeyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of Mars, and the\nson of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who quarrelled with his father,\nand went to settle in Dulichium. With him there came forty ships.\n\nUlysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum with its\nforests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus, with the\nmainland also that was over against the islands. These were led by\nUlysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there came twelve ships.\n\nThoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in Pleuron,\nOlenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon, for the great\nking Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself dead, as was also\ngolden-haired Meleager, who had been set over the Aetolians to be their\nking. And with Thoas there came forty ships.\n\nThe famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus, and\nthe well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and Lycastus that\nlies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus and Rhytium, with\nthe other peoples that dwelt in the hundred cities of Crete. All these\nwere led by Idomeneus, and by Meriones, peer of murderous Mars. And\nwith these there came eighty ships.\n\nTlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of stature,\nbrought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These dwelt in\nRhodes which is divided among the three cities of Lindus, Ielysus, and\nCameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These were commanded by Tlepolemus,\nson of Hercules by Astyochea, whom he had carried off from Ephyra, on\nthe river Selleis, after sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When\nTlepolemus grew up, he killed his father's uncle Licymnius, who had\nbeen a famous warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On this he\nbuilt himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled beyond the\nsea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons of Hercules.\nAfter a voyage, during which he suffered great hardship, he came to\nRhodes, where the people divided into three communities, according to\ntheir tribes, and were dearly loved by Jove, the lord of gods and men;\nwherefore the son of Saturn showered down great riches upon them.\n\nAnd Nireus brought three ships from Syme--Nireus, who was the\nhandsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after the\nson of Peleus--but he was a man of no substance, and had but a small\nfollowing.\n\nAnd those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the city\nof Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were commanded by\nPheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus the son of\nHercules. And with them there came thirty ships.\n\nThose again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis; and\nthose of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were called\nMyrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships, over which\nAchilles was in command. But they now took no part in the war, inasmuch\nas there was no one to marshal them; for Achilles stayed by his ships,\nfurious about the loss of the girl Briseis, whom he had taken from\nLyrnessus at his own great peril, when he had sacked Lyrnessus and\nThebe, and had overthrown Mynes and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor,\nson of Selepus. For her sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere long\nhe was again to join them.\n\nAnd those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,\nsanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the sea, and\nPteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave Protesilaus had\nbeen captain while he was yet alive, but he was now lying under the\nearth. He had left a wife behind him in Phylace to tear her cheeks in\nsorrow, and his house was only half finished, for he was slain by a\nDardanian warrior while leaping foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil\nof Troy. Still, though his people mourned their chieftain, they were\nnot without a leader, for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled\nthem; he was son of Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of\nPhylacus, and he was own brother to Protesilaus, only younger,\nProtesilaus being at once the elder and the more valiant. So the people\nwere not without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost.\nWith him there came forty ships.\n\nAnd those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe, Glaphyrae,\nand the populous city of Iolcus, these with their eleven ships were led\nby Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis bore to him, loveliest of the\ndaughters of Pelias.\n\nAnd those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and rugged\nOlizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes, and they had\nseven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them good archers; but\nPhiloctetes was lying in great pain in the Island of Lemnos, where the\nsons of the Achaeans left him, for he had been bitten by a poisonous\nwater snake. There he lay sick and sorry, and full soon did the Argives\ncome to miss him. But his people, though they felt his loss were not\nleaderless, for Medon, the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in\narray.\n\nThose, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they that\nheld Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were commanded by\nthe two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of healing, Podalirius\nand Machaon. And with them there came thirty ships.\n\nThe men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia, with\nthose that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus, these were\nled by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them there came forty\nships.\n\nThose that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white city\nof Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was son of\nPirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia bore him to\nPirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the shaggy mountain\nsavages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the Aithices. But Polypoetes\nwas not sole in command, for with him was Leonteus, of the race of\nMars, who was son of Coronus, the son of Caeneus. And with these there\ncame forty ships.\n\nGuneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was followed by\nthe Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about wintry Dodona, and\nheld the lands round the lovely river Titaresius, which sends its\nwaters into the Peneus. They do not mingle with the silver eddies of\nthe Peneus, but flow on the top of them like oil; for the Titaresius is\na branch of dread Orcus and of the river Styx.\n\nOf the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They were\nthey that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion. Prothous, fleet\nof foot, was their leader, and with him there came forty ships.\n\nSuch were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O Muse, was\nthe foremost, whether man or horse, among those that followed after the\nsons of Atreus?\n\nOf the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest. They\nwere driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They were of the\nsame age and colour, and perfectly matched in height. Apollo, of the\nsilver bow, had bred them in Perea--both of them mares, and terrible as\nMars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of Telamon, was much the foremost\nso long as Achilles' anger lasted, for Achilles excelled him greatly\nand he had also better horses; but Achilles was now holding aloof at\nhis ships by reason of his quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people\npassed their time upon the sea shore, throwing discs or aiming with\nspears at a mark, and in archery. Their horses stood each by his own\nchariot, champing lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under\ncover, but their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered hither and\nthither about the host and went not forth to fight.\n\nThus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth groaned\nbeneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes the land\nabout Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus lies. Even so\ndid the earth groan beneath them as they sped over the plain.\n\nAnd now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad news\namong the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and young, at\nPriam's gates, and Iris came close up to Priam, speaking with the voice\nof Priam's son Polites, who, being fleet of foot, was stationed as\nwatchman for the Trojans on the tomb of old Aesyetes, to look out for\nany sally of the Achaeans. In his likeness Iris spoke, saying, \"Old\nman, you talk idly, as in time of peace, while war is at hand. I have\nbeen in many a battle, but never yet saw such a host as is now\nadvancing. They are crossing the plain to attack the city as thick as\nleaves or as the sands of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all\nothers, do as I say. There are many allies dispersed about the city of\nPriam from distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore, let\neach chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in\narray and leading them forth to battle.\"\n\nThus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at once\nbroke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates were opened,\nand the people thronged through them, horse and foot, with the tramp as\nof a great multitude.\n\nNow there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon the\nplain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the tomb of\nlithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided their forces.\n\nPriam's son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the\nTrojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most\nvaliant of those who were longing for the fray.\n\nThe Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to Anchises,\nwhen she, goddess though she was, had lain with him upon the mountain\nslopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him were the two sons of\nAntenor, Archilochus and Acamas, both skilled in all the arts of war.\n\nThey that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men of\nsubstance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are of\nTrojan blood--these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom Apollo had\ntaught to use the bow.\n\nThey that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia, and the\nhigh mountain of Tereia--these were led by Adrestus and Amphius, whose\nbreastplate was of linen. These were the sons of Merops of Percote, who\nexcelled in all kinds of divination. He told them not to take part in\nthe war, but they gave him no heed, for fate lured them to destruction.\n\nThey that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos, and\nArisbe--these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave\ncommander--Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay\nsteeds, of the breed that comes from the river Selleis, had brought\nfrom Arisbe.\n\nHippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in fertile\nLarissa--Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two sons of the\nPelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus.\n\nAcamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those that\ncame from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.\n\nEuphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the\nCiconian spearsmen.\n\nPyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the broad\nwaters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the earth.\n\nThe Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from\nEnetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that held\nCytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by the river\nParthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini.\n\nOdius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from distant\nAlybe, where there are mines of silver.\n\nChromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in\naugury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by the\nhand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he slew\nothers also of the Trojans.\n\nPhorcys, again, and noble Ascanius led the Phrygians from the far\ncountry of Ascania, and both were eager for the fray.\n\nMesthles and Antiphus commanded the Meonians, sons of Talaemenes, born\nto him of the Gygaean lake. These led the Meonians, who dwelt under Mt.\nTmolus.\n\nNastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held Miletus and\nthe wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of the river Maeander\nand the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were commanded by Nastes and\nAmphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He came into the fight with gold\nabout him, like a girl; fool that he was, his gold was of no avail to\nsave him, for he fell in the river by the hand of the fleet descendant\nof Aeacus, and Achilles bore away his gold.\n\nSarpedon and Glaucus led the Lycians from their distant land, by the\neddying waters of the Xanthus.\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n  Alexandria, also called Paris, challenges Menelaus--Helen and\n  Priam view the Achaeans from the wall--The covenant--Paris\n  and Menelaus fight, and Paris is worsted--Venus carries him\n  off to save him--Scene between him and Helen.\n\nWhen the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain, the\nTrojans advanced as a flight of wild fowl or cranes that scream\noverhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing waters of\nOceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies, and they wrangle\nin the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched silently, in high\nheart, and minded to stand by one another.\n\nAs when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the mountain\ntops, bad for shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man\ncan see no further than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dust\nfrom under their feet as they made all speed over the plain.\n\nWhen they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward as\nchampion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a\npanther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two spears shod with\nbronze as a challenge to the bravest of the Achaeans to meet him in\nsingle fight. Menelaus saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and\nwas glad as a hungry lion that lights on the carcase of some goat or\nhorned stag, and devours it there and then, though dogs and youths set\nupon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of\nAlexandrus, for he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang,\ntherefore, from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour.\n\nAlexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in fear\nof his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted,\ntrembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some\nmountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge into the throng of Trojan\nwarriors, terror-stricken at the sight of the son of Atreus.\n\nThen Hector upbraided him. \"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair\nto see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never\nbeen born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be\ndisgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and\nsay that we have sent one to champion us who is fair to see but who has\nneither wit nor courage? Did you not, such as you are, get your\nfollowing together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your a\nfar country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of\nwarriors--to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole\ncountry, but joy to your enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to\nyourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner\nof man he is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your\nlyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when\nyou were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed\npeople, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs\nyou have done them.\"\n\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just. You are hard as\nthe axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber\nto his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your\nscorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has given\nme; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the gods give\nthem where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If\nyou would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans\ntake their seats, while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all\nher wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better\nman take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let\nthe rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans shall\nstay here in Troy, while the others go home to Argos and the land of\nthe Achaeans.\"\n\nWhen Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan\nranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back, and they all\nsat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still aimed at him with\nstones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to them saying, \"Hold,\nArgives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans; Hector desires to speak.\"\n\nThey ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke. \"Hear from\nmy mouth,\" said he, \"Trojans and Achaeans, the saying of Alexandrus,\nthrough whom this quarrel has come about. He bids the Trojans and\nAchaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while he and Menelaus fight\nin the midst of you for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be\nvictorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she\nhas, to bear them to his own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn\ncovenant of peace.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of the loud\nbattle-cry addressed them. \"And now,\" he said, \"hear me too, for it is\nI who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the parting of Achaeans and\nTrojans is at hand, as well it may be, seeing how much have suffered\nfor my quarrel with Alexandrus and the wrong he did me. Let him who\nshall die, die, and let the others fight no more. Bring, then, two\nlambs, a white ram and a black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will\nbring a third for Jove. Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may\nswear to the covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to\ntrust, and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.\nYoung men's minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he looks\nbefore and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon both sides.\"\n\nThe Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they\nthought that they should now have rest. They backed their chariots\ntoward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their armour, laying it\ndown upon the ground; and the hosts were near to one another with a\nlittle space between them. Hector sent two messengers to the city to\nbring the lambs and to bid Priam come, while Agamemnon told Talthybius\nto fetch the other lamb from the ships, and he did as Agamemnon had\nsaid.\n\nMeanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law, wife of\nthe son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had married Laodice,\nthe fairest of Priam's daughters. She found her in her own room,\nworking at a great web of purple linen, on which she was embroidering\nthe battles between Trojans and Achaeans, that Mars had made them fight\nfor her sake. Iris then came close up to her and said, \"Come hither,\nchild, and see the strange doings of the Trojans and Achaeans. Till now\nthey have been warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now\nthey have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,\nsitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus and\nMenelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be the wife\nof him who is the victor.\"\n\nThus spoke the goddess, and Helen's heart yearned after her former\nhusband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white mantle over her\nhead, and hurried from her room, weeping as she went, not alone, but\nattended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae, daughter of Pittheus, and\nClymene. And straightway they were at the Scaean gates.\n\nThe two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were seated\nby the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes, Lampus, Clytius,\nand Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too old to fight, but they\nwere fluent orators, and sat on the tower like cicales that chirrup\ndelicately from the boughs of some high tree in a wood. When they saw\nHelen coming towards the tower, they said softly to one another, \"Small\nwonder that Trojans and Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for\nthe sake of a woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair\nthough she be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for\nus and for our children after us.\"\n\nBut Priam bade her draw nigh. \"My child,\" said he, \"take your seat in\nfront of me that you may see your former husband, your kinsmen and your\nfriends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the gods, not you who are to\nblame. It is they that have brought about this terrible war with the\nAchaeans. Tell me, then, who is yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I\nhave seen men taller by a head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely\nhe must be a king.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered Helen, \"father of my husband, dear and reverend in my\neyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have come here with\nyour son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends, my darling daughter,\nand all the companions of my girlhood. But it was not to be, and my lot\nis one of tears and sorrow. As for your question, the hero of whom you\nask is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier,\nbrother-in-law as surely as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable\nself.\"\n\nThe old man marvelled at him and said, \"Happy son of Atreus, child of\ngood fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you in great\nmultitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen, the people of\nOtreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the banks of the river\nSangarius; I was their ally, and with them when the Amazons, peers of\nmen, came up against them, but even they were not so many as the\nAchaeans.\"\n\nThe old man next looked upon Ulysses; \"Tell me,\" he said, \"who is that\nother, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across the chest\nand shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and he stalks in\nfront of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram ordering his ewes.\"\n\nAnd Helen answered, \"He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of\nLaertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner of\nstratagems and subtle cunning.\"\n\nOn this Antenor said, \"Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once came\nhere as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I received them in\nmy own house, and therefore know both of them by sight and\nconversation. When they stood up in presence of the assembled Trojans,\nMenelaus was the broader shouldered, but when both were seated Ulysses\nhad the more royal presence. After a time they delivered their message,\nand the speech of Menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue; he did not say\nmuch, for he was a man of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to\nthe point, though he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the\nother hand, when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his\neyes fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of\nhis sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised in\noratory--one might have taken him for a mere churl or simpleton; but\nwhen he raised his voice, and the words came driving from his deep\nchest like winter snow before the wind, then there was none to touch\nhim, and no man thought further of what he looked like.\"\n\nPriam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, \"Who is that great and\ngoodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the rest of\nthe Argives?\"\n\n\"That,\" answered Helen, \"is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, and on\nthe other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus looking like\na god, and with the captains of the Cretans round him. Often did\nMenelaus receive him as a guest in our house when he came visiting us\nfrom Crete. I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could\ntell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of\nhorses, and Pollux the mighty boxer; they are children of my mother,\nand own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or\nelse, though they have brought their ships, they will not show\nthemselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought\nupon them.\"\n\nShe knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the earth\nin their own land of Lacedaemon.\n\nMeanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings through the\ncity--two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of earth; and Idaeus\nbrought the mixing bowl and the cups of gold. He went up to Priam and\nsaid, \"Son of Laomedon, the princes of the Trojans and Achaeans bid you\ncome down on to the plain and swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus\nand Menelaus are to fight for Helen in single combat, that she and all\nher wealth may go with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a\nsolemn covenant of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy,\nwhile the Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThe old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the\nhorses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside him;\nthey then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain. When they\nreached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left the chariot,\nand with measured pace advanced into the space between the hosts.\n\nAgamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants brought on\nthe oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls; they poured\nwater over the hands of the chieftains, and the son of Atreus drew the\ndagger that hung by his sword, and cut wool from the lambs' heads; this\nthe men-servants gave about among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and\nthe son of Atreus lifted up his hands in prayer. \"Father Jove,\" he\ncried, \"that rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun,\nthat seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who\nin the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his oath,\nwitness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain. If\nAlexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her wealth, while\nwe sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills Alexandrus, let the\nTrojans give back Helen and all that she has; let them moreover pay\nsuch fine to the Achaeans as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among\nthose that shall be born hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse\nsuch fine when Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here and fight\non till I have got satisfaction.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims, and\nlaid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the knife had\nreft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from the mixing-bowl\ninto the cups, and prayed to the everlasting gods, saying, Trojans and\nAchaeans among one another, \"Jove, most great and glorious, and ye\nother everlasting gods, grant that the brains of them who shall first\nsin against their oaths--of them and their children--may be shed upon\nthe ground even as this wine, and let their wives become the slaves of\nstrangers.\"\n\nThus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their prayer.\nThen Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans\nand Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten city of Ilius: I\ndare not with my own eyes witness this fight between my son and\nMenelaus, for Jove and the other immortals alone know which shall fall.\"\n\nOn this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat. He\ngathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him; the two\nthen went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the ground, and\ncast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should take aim first.\nMeanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and prayed saying,\n\"Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, grant that\nhe who first brought about this war between us may die, and enter the\nhouse of Hades, while we others remain at peace and abide by our oaths.\"\n\nGreat Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet, and\nthe lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their several\nstations, each by his horses and the place where his arms were lying,\nwhile Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his goodly armour.\nFirst he greaved his legs with greaves of good make and fitted with\nancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned the cuirass of his brother\nLycaon, and fitted it to his own body; he hung his silver-studded sword\nof bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his\ncomely head he set his helmet, well-wrought, with a crest of horse-hair\nthat nodded menacingly above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear\nthat suited his hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.\n\nWhen they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode fierce\nof aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and Achaeans were\nstruck with awe as they beheld them. They stood near one another on the\nmeasured ground, brandishing their spears, and each furious against the\nother. Alexandrus aimed first, and struck the round shield of the son\nof Atreus, but the spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its\npoint. Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so.\n\"King Jove,\" he said, \"grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has wronged\nme; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a man may shrink\nfrom doing ill deeds in the house of his host.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of\nAlexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the shirt by\nhis flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved his life. Then\nthe son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the projecting part of\nhis helmet, but the sword fell shivered in three or four pieces from\nhis hand, and he cried, looking towards Heaven, \"Father Jove, of all\ngods thou art the most despiteful; I made sure of my revenge, but the\nsword has broken in my hand, my spear has been hurled in vain, and I\nhave not killed him.\"\n\nWith this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horsehair plume of\nhis helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans. The strap of\nthe helmet that went under his chin was choking him, and Menelaus would\nhave dragged him off to his own great glory had not Jove's daughter\nVenus been quick to mark and to break the strap of oxhide, so that the\nempty helmet came away in his hand. This he flung to his comrades among\nthe Achaeans, and was again springing upon Alexandrus to run him\nthrough with a spear, but Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god\ncan do), hid him under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own\nbedchamber.\n\nThen she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with the\nTrojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old woman who\nused to dress wool for her when she was still in Lacedaemon, and of\nwhom she was very fond. Thus disguised she plucked her by perfumed robe\nand said, \"Come hither; Alexandrus says you are to go to the house; he\nis on his bed in his own room, radiant with beauty and dressed in\ngorgeous apparel. No one would think he had just come from fighting,\nbut rather that he was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was\nsitting down.\"\n\nWith these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she marked\nthe beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and sparkling\neyes, she marvelled at her and said, \"Goddess, why do you thus beguile\nme? Are you going to send me afield still further to some man whom you\nhave taken up in Phrygia or fair Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished\nAlexandrus, and is to take my hateful self back with him. You are come\nhere to betray me. Go sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be\ngoddess no longer; never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry\nabout him and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the\nmatter of that, his slave--but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his\nbed no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.\nBesides, I have trouble on my mind.\"\n\nVenus was very angry, and said, \"Bold hussy, do not provoke me; if you\ndo, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as I have loved\nyou. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans and Achaeans, and you\nshall come to a bad end.\"\n\nAt this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her and went\nin silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the Trojan women.\n\nWhen they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set about\ntheir work, but Helen went into her own room, and the laughter-loving\ngoddess took a seat and set it for her facing Alexandrus. On this\nHelen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat down, and with eyes askance\nbegan to upbraid her husband.\n\n\"So you are come from the fight,\" said she; \"would that you had fallen\nrather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband. You used to\nbrag that you were a better man with hands and spear than Menelaus. Go,\nthen, and challenge him again--but I should advise you not to do so,\nfor if you are foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will\nsoon fall by his spear.\"\n\nAnd Paris answered, \"Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches. This\ntime, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me; another\ntime I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me.\nCome, let us lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so\npassionately enamoured of you as at this moment--not even when I first\ncarried you off from Lacedaemon and sailed away with you--not even when\nI had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae\nwas I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" On this he led her\ntowards the bed, and his wife went with him.\n\nThus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of Atreus\nstrode among the throng, looking everywhere for Alexandrus, and no man,\nneither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find him. If they had\nseen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of them hated\nhim as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke,\nsaying, \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been\nwith Menelaus; therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay\nsuch fine as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall\nbe born hereafter.\"\n\nThus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in applause.\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\n  A quarrel in Olympus--Minerva goes down and persuades Fandarus\n  to violate the oaths by wounding Menelaus with an arrow--Agamemnon\n  makes a speech and sends for Machaon--He then\n  goes about among his captains and upbraids Ulysses and\n  Sthenelus, who each of them retort fiercely--Diomed checks\n  Sthenelus, and the two hosts then engage, with great slaughter\n  on either side.\n\nNow the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden floor\nwhile Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink, and as they\npledged one another in their cups of gold they looked down upon the\ntown of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease Juno, talking at\nher so as to provoke her. \"Menelaus,\" said he, \"has two good friends\namong the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and Minerva of Alalcomene, but they\nonly sit still and look on, while Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus' side\nto defend him in any danger; indeed she has just rescued him when he\nmade sure that it was all over with him--for the victory really did lie\nwith Menelaus. We must consider what we shall do about all this; shall\nwe set them fighting anew or make peace between them? If you will agree\nto this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the city of Priam may\nremain still inhabited.\"\n\nMinerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by side\nhatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her father, for\nshe was in a furious passion with him, and said nothing, but Juno could\nnot contain herself. \"Dread son of Saturn,\" said she, \"what, pray, is\nthe meaning of all this? Is my trouble, then, to go for nothing, and\nthe sweat that I have sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while\ngetting the people together against Priam and his children? Do as you\nwill, but we other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.\"\n\nJove was angry and answered, \"My dear, what harm have Priam and his\nsons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city of Ilius?\nWill nothing do for you but you must within their walls and eat Priam\nraw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to boot? Have it your own\nway then; for I would not have this matter become a bone of contention\nbetween us. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, if ever I\nwant to sack a city belonging to friends of yours, you must not try to\nstop me; you will have to let me do it, for I am giving in to you\nsorely against my will. Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars\nof heaven, there was none that I so much respected as Ilius with Priam\nand his whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting about my\naltar, nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due to ourselves.\"\n\n\"My own three favourite cities,\" answered Juno, \"are Argos, Sparta, and\nMycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased with them. I shall\nnot defend them and I shall not care. Even if I did, and tried to stay\nyou, I should take nothing by it, for you are much stronger than I am,\nbut I will not have my own work wasted. I too am a god and of the same\nrace with yourself. I am Saturn's eldest daughter, and am honourable\nnot on this ground only, but also because I am your wife, and you are\nking over the gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take between\nus, and the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go\nand take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the\nTrojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the\nAchaeans.\"\n\nThe sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva, \"Go at\nonce into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that the Trojans\nshall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\"\n\nThis was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted from\nthe topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as some\nbrilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent as a sign to\nmariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of light follows in\nits wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld,\nand one would turn to his neighbour, saying, \"Either we shall again\nhave war and din of combat, or Jove the lord of battle will now make\npeace between us.\"\n\nThus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus, son of\nAntenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find Pandarus,\nthe redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing among the\nstalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of the Aesopus, so\nshe went close up to him and said, \"Brave son of Lycaon, will you do as\nI tell you? If you dare send an arrow at Menelaus you will win honour\nand thanks from all the Trojans, and especially from prince\nAlexandrus--he would be the first to requite you very handsomely if he\ncould see Menelaus mount his funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your\nhand. Take your home aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous\narcher; vow that when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you\nwill offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.\"\n\nHis fool's heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its case. This\nbow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he had killed as it\nwas bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and it had fallen as the\narrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were sixteen palms long, and a\nworker in horn had made them into a bow, smoothing them well down, and\ngiving them tips of gold. When Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it\ncarefully on the ground, and his brave followers held their shields\nbefore him lest the Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot\nMenelaus. Then he opened the lid of his quiver and took out a winged\narrow that had not yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of death. He\nlaid the arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo, the famous\narcher, vowing that when he got home to his strong city of Zelea he\nwould offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour. He laid the\nnotch of the arrow on the oxhide bowstring, and drew both notch and\nstring to his breast till the arrow-head was near the bow; then when\nthe bow was arched into a half-circle he let fly, and the bow twanged,\nand the string sang as the arrow flew gladly on over the heads of the\nthrong.\n\nBut the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove's\ndaughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee and\nward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a mother\nwhisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping sweetly; she guided\nit to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over\nhis double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that\nwent tightly round him. It went right through this and through the\ncuirass of cunning workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it,\nwhich he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this\nthat served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through\nit and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing from the\nwound.\n\nAs when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a piece\nof ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is to be laid up\nin a treasure house--many a knight is fain to bear it, but the king\nkeeps it as an ornament of which both horse and driver may be\nproud--even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs and your legs down\nto your fair ancles stained with blood.\n\nWhen King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was afraid,\nand so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the barbs of the\narrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to the shaft were still\noutside the wound. Then he took heart, but Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh\nas he held Menelaus's hand in his own, and his comrades made moan in\nconcert. \"Dear brother,\" he cried, \"I have been the death of you in\npledging this covenant and letting you come forward as our champion.\nThe Trojans have trampled on their oaths and have wounded you;\nnevertheless the oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the\nright hands of fellowship in which we have put our trust shall not be\nvain. If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yet\nfulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives and\nwith their wives and children. The day will surely come when mighty\nIlius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam's people, when the son of\nSaturn from his high throne shall overshadow them with his awful aegis\nin punishment of their present treachery. This shall surely be; but\nhow, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it be your lot now to die? I\nshould return to Argos as a by-word, for the Achaeans will at once go\nhome. We shall leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping\nHelen, and the earth will rot your bones as you lie here at Troy with\nyour purpose not fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon\nyour tomb and say, 'Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he\nbrought his army in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty\nships, and has left Menelaus behind him.' Thus will one of them say,\nand may the earth then swallow me.\"\n\nBut Menelaus reassured him and said, \"Take heart, and do not alarm the\npeople; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part, for my outer belt\nof burnished metal first stayed it, and under this my cuirass and the\nbelt of mail which the bronze-smiths made me.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be even\nso, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs upon it to\nrelieve your pain.\"\n\nHe then said to Talthybius, \"Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the great\nphysician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus immediately. Some\nTrojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow to our dismay,\nand to his own great glory.\"\n\nTalthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to find\nMachaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors who had\nfollowed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and said, \"Son of\nAesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come and see Menelaus\nimmediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an arrow\nto our dismay and to his own great glory.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed through the\nspreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they came to the place\nwhere Menelaus had been wounded and was lying with the chieftains\ngathered in a circle round him. Machaon passed into the middle of the\nring and at once drew the arrow from the belt, bending its barbs back\nthrough the force with which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished\nbelt, and beneath this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the\nbronze-smiths had made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped away\nthe blood and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given to\nAesculapius out of the good will he bore him.\n\nWhile they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came forward\nagainst them, for they had put on their armour, and now renewed the\nfight.\n\nYou would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and\nunwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his chariot\nrich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of Eurymedon, son of\nPtolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him hold them in readiness\nagainst the time his limbs should weary of going about and giving\norders to so many, for he went among the ranks on foot. When he saw men\nhasting to the front he stood by them and cheered them on. \"Argives,\"\nsaid he, \"slacken not one whit in your onset; father Jove will be no\nhelper of liars; the Trojans have been the first to break their oaths\nand to attack us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; we\nshall take their city and carry off their wives and children in our\nships.\"\n\nBut he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined to\nfight. \"Argives,\" he cried, \"cowardly miserable creatures, have you no\nshame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when they can no longer\nscud over the plain, huddle together, but show no fight? You are as\ndazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait till the Trojans reach the\nsterns of our ships as they lie on the shore, to see whether the son of\nSaturn will hold his hand over you to protect you?\"\n\nThus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing through\nthe crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round Idomeneus,\nwho was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while Meriones was\nbringing up the battalions that were in the rear. Agamemnon was glad\nwhen he saw him, and spoke him fairly. \"Idomeneus,\" said he, \"I treat\nyou with greater distinction than I do any others of the Achaeans,\nwhether in war or in other things, or at table. When the princes are\nmixing my choicest wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a\nfixed allowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you\nmay drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle, and show\nyourself the man you have been always proud to be.\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised you from\nthe first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that we may join\nbattle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon their covenants.\nDeath and destruction shall be theirs, seeing they have been the first\nto break their oaths and to attack us.\"\n\nThe son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the two\nAjaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot-soldiers. As when a\ngoat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep\nbefore the west wind--black as pitch is the offing and a mighty\nwhirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and drives his flock\ninto a cave--even thus did the ranks of stalwart youths move in a dark\nmass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid with shield and spear. Glad was\nKing Agamemnon when he saw them. \"No need,\" he cried, \"to give orders\nto such leaders of the Argives as you are, for of your own selves you\nspur your men on to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city of\nPriam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.\"\n\nWith this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile speaker of\nthe Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging them on, in company\nwith Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and Bias shepherd of his\npeople. He placed his knights with their chariots and horses in the\nfront rank, while the foot-soldiers, brave men and many, whom he could\ntrust, were in the rear. The cowards he drove into the middle, that\nthey might fight whether they would or no. He gave his orders to the\nknights first, bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to\navoid confusion. \"Let no man,\" he said, \"relying on his strength or\nhorsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the Trojans,\nnor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your attack; but let each\nwhen he meets an enemy's chariot throw his spear from his own; this be\nmuch the best; this is how the men of old took towns and strongholds;\nin this wise were they minded.\"\n\nThus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a fight, and\nKing Agamemnon was glad. \"I wish,\" he said to him, \"that your limbs\nwere as supple and your strength as sure as your judgment is; but age,\nthe common enemy of mankind, has laid his hand upon you; would that it\nhad fallen upon some other, and that you were still young.\"\n\nAnd Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, \"Son of Atreus, I too would\ngladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but the gods\nwill not give us everything at one and the same time. I was then young,\nand now I am old; still I can go with my knights and give them that\ncounsel which old men have a right to give. The wielding of the spear I\nleave to those who are younger and stronger than myself.\"\n\nAgamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus, son\nof Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the Athenians loud\nof tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning Ulysses, with his\nsturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not yet heard the battle-cry,\nfor the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans had only just begun to move, so\nthey were standing still, waiting for some other columns of the\nAchaeans to attack the Trojans and begin the fighting. When he saw this\nAgamemnon rebuked them and said, \"Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped\nin cunning, heart of guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on\nothers? You two should be of all men foremost when there is hard\nfighting to be done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitation\nwhen we councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast. You are glad\nenough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as long\nas you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw ten\ncolumns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.\"\n\nUlysses glared at him and answered, \"Son of Atreus, what are you\ntalking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the Achaeans are\nin full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if you care to do so,\nthat the father of Telemachus will join battle with the foremost of\nthem. You are talking idly.\"\n\nWhen Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly at him\nand withdrew his words. \"Ulysses,\" said he, \"noble son of Laertes,\nexcellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to find nor orders\nto give you, for I know your heart is right, and that you and I are of\na mind. Enough; I will make you amends for what I have said, and if any\nill has now been spoken may the gods bring it to nothing.\"\n\nHe then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son of\nTydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with\nSthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to upbraid\nhim. \"Son of Tydeus,\" he said, \"why stand you cowering here upon the\nbrink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but was ever ahead of his\nmen when leading them on against the foe--so, at least, say they that\nsaw him in battle, for I never set eyes upon him myself. They say that\nthere was no man like him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but\nas a guest, in company with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they\nwere levying war against the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our\npeople for a body of picked men to help them. The men of Mycenae were\nwilling to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them by showing them\nunfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices went their way.\nWhen they had got as far the deep-meadowed and rush-grown banks of the\nAesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as their envoy, and he found the\nCadmeans gathered in great numbers to a banquet in the house of\nEteocles. Stranger though he was, he knew no fear on finding himself\nsingle-handed among so many, but challenged them to contests of all\nkinds, and in each one of them was at once victorious, so mightily did\nMinerva help him. The Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a\nforce of fifty youths with two captains--the godlike hero Maeon, son of\nHaemon, and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus--at their head, to lie in\nwait for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them,\nsave only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven's omens. Such\nwas Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he cannot\nfight as his father did.\"\n\nDiomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of Agamemnon;\nbut the son of Capaneus took up his words and said, \"Son of Atreus,\ntell no lies, for you can speak truth if you will. We boast ourselves\nas even better men than our fathers; we took seven-gated Thebes, though\nthe wall was stronger and our men were fewer in number, for we trusted\nin the omens of the gods and in the help of Jove, whereas they perished\nthrough their own sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like\nhonour with us.\"\n\nDiomed looked sternly at him and said, \"Hold your peace, my friend, as\nI bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge the Achaeans\nforward, for the glory will be his if we take the city, and his the\nshame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us acquit ourselves with\nvalour.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so fiercely\nabout his body that even a brave man might well have been scared to\nhear it.\n\nAs when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west wind\nhas lashed it into fury--it has reared its head afar and now comes\ncrashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high over the\njagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all directions--even so did the\nserried phalanxes of the Danaans march steadfastly to battle. The\nchiefs gave orders each to his own people, but the men said never a\nword; no man would think it, for huge as the host was, it seemed as\nthough there was not a tongue among them, so silent were they in their\nobedience; and as they marched the armour about their bodies glistened\nin the sun. But the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that of many\nthousand ewes that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich\nflockmaster, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of their\nlambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their tongues were\ndiverse, and they came from many different places. These were inspired\nof Mars, but the others by Minerva--and with them came Panic, Rout, and\nStrife whose fury never tires, sister and friend of murderous Mars,\nwho, from being at first but low in stature, grows till she uprears her\nhead to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She it was that\nwent about among them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow\nwith even hand between them.\n\nWhen they were got together in one place shield clashed with shield and\nspear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed shields beat one\nupon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude--death-cry\nand shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with\nblood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep\nchannels till the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd on\nthe hillside hears their roaring from afar--even such was the toil and\nuproar of the hosts as they joined in battle.\n\nFirst Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus, son\nof Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at the\nprojecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\npoint of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes;\nheadlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he\ndropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and captain of the proud\nAbantes began dragging him out of reach of the darts that were falling\naround him, in haste to strip him of his armour. But his purpose was\nnot for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away, and smote him in the\nside with his bronze-shod spear--for as he stooped his side was left\nunprotected by his shield--and thus he perished. Then the fight between\nTrojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon\neach other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other.\n\nForthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius, son of\nAnthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the Simois, as she was\ncoming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been with her parents to see\ntheir flocks. Therefore he was named Simoeisius, but he did not live to\npay his parents for his rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the\nspear of mighty Ajax, who struck him in the breast by the right nipple\nas he was coming on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right\nthrough his shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight\nand tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with branches.\nThen the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he may fashion a\nfelloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it lies seasoning by\nthe waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to earth Simoeisius, son of\nAnthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the gleaming corslet, son of Priam,\nhurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit\nLeucus, the brave comrade of Ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging\nthe body of Simoeisius over to the other side; so he fell upon the body\nand loosed his hold upon it. Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus\nslain, and strode in full armour through the front ranks till he was\nquite close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the\nTrojans fell back as he did so. His dart was not sped in vain, for it\nstruck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who had come to him from\nAbydos, where he had charge of his father's mares. Ulysses, infuriated\nby the death of his comrade, hit him with his spear on one temple, and\nthe bronze point came through on the other side of his forehead.\nThereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armour rang rattling round\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector, and they that were in\nfront, then gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off\nthe dead, pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked\ndown from Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was\ndispleased. \"Trojans,\" he cried, \"rush on the foe, and do not let\nyourselves be thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor\niron that when hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the\nson of lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the\nships.\"\n\nThus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while Jove's\nredoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the host of the\nAchaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them slackening.\n\nThen fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck by a\njagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled it was\nPeirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who had come from\nAenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed by the pitiless\nstone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in his death throes\nstretched out his hands towards his comrades. But Peirous, who had\nwounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly, so that\nhis bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his\neyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the\nchest near the nipple, and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas\ncame close up to him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then\ndrawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he\ndied; but he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian\ncomrades, men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,\nstood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for all\nhis great stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the two\ncorpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one captain of\nthe Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many another fell round\nthem.\n\nAnd now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could have\ngone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva leading him\nby the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and arrows.\nFor many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side\nface downwards upon the earth.\n\n\n\nBOOK V\n\n  The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,\n  continues fighting--He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas--Venus\n  rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him\n  to the care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended\n  by her mother Dione--Mars encourages the Trojans, and\n  AEneas returns to the fight cured of his wound--Minerva and\n  Juno help the Achaeans, and by the advice of the former\n  Diomed wounds Mars, who returns to Olympus to get cured.\n\nThen Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of Tydeus,\nthat he might excel all the other Argives, and cover himself with\nglory. She made a stream of fire flare from his shield and helmet like\nthe star that shines most brilliantly in summer after its bath in the\nwaters of Oceanus--even such a fire did she kindle upon his head and\nshoulders as she bade him speed into the thickest hurly-burly of the\nfight.\n\nNow there was a certain rich and honourable man among the Trojans,\npriest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two sons, Phegeus and\nIdaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These two came\nforward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomed, he being on\nfoot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to\none another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomed's\nleft shoulder without hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear\nsped not in vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and\nhe fell from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother's\nbody, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would have\nshared his brother's fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by wrapping him in\na cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly\noverwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the\nhorses, and bade his followers take them to the ships. The Trojans were\nscared when they saw the two sons of Dares, one of them in fright and\nthe other lying dead by his chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by\nthe hand and said, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, bloodstained stormer of\ncities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out,\nand see to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go\naway, and thus avoid his anger.\"\n\nSo saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon the\nsteep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the Trojans\nback, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First King\nAgamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni, from his\nchariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back,\njust as he was turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders\nand went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round\nhim as he fell heavily to the ground.\n\nThen Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had come\nfrom Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right shoulder as he\nwas mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded him as\nhe fell heavily from the car.\n\nThe squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while Menelaus, son\nof Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius, a mighty huntsman\nand keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had taught him how to kill\nevery kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain forests, but\nneither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for the\nspear of Menelaus struck him in the back as he was flying; it struck\nhim between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he\nfell headlong and his armour rang rattling round him.\n\nMeriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son of\nHermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning\nworkmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was that\nmade the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of all\nmischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexandrus\nhimself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him\nas he was flying, and struck him on the right buttock. The point of the\nspear went through the bone into the bladder, and death came upon him\nas he cried aloud and fell forward on his knees.\n\nMeges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was a\nbastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own children, for\nthe love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to him\nand drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue\nall among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell dead in the\ndust.\n\nAnd Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble\nDolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and was\nhonoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus gave him\nchase as he was flying before him, smote him with his sword upon the\narm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand fell to\nthe ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\nwithstand, came over his eyes.\n\nThus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son of\nTydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the Achaeans or the\nTrojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that has\nburst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no walls of fruitful\nvineyards can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but\nin a moment it comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that\nmany a strong man's hand has reclaimed--even so were the dense\nphalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many\nthough they were, they dared not abide his onslaught.\n\nNow when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving the\nTrojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the front part\nof his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through the\nmetal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with\nblood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph, \"Knights Trojans,\ncome on; the bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold\nout much longer if King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from\nLycia hither.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who withdrew\nand made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.\n\"Dear son of Capaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot, and draw\nthe arrow out of my shoulder.\"\n\nSthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the wound,\nwhereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that had been made\nin his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and\nstood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me\nto come within a spear's throw of that man and kill him. He has been\ntoo quick for me and has wounded me; and now he is boasting that I\nshall not see the light of the sun much longer.\"\n\nThus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs supple\nand quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up close to him and\nsaid, \"Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the Trojans, for I have set\nin your heart the spirit of your knightly father Tydeus. Moreover, I\nhave withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men\napart. If, then, any other god comes here and offers you battle, do not\nfight him; but should Jove's daughter Venus come, strike her with your\nspear and wound her.\"\n\nWhen she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus again\ntook his place among the foremost fighters, three times more fierce\neven than he had been before. He was like a lion that some mountain\nshepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall\nof a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The shepherd has roused the brute\nto fury but cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of\nthe buildings, while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are\nsmothered in heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps\nout over the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about\namong the Trojans.\n\nHe killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one with a\nthrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the other with\na sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his neck\nand back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and\nPolyidus, sons of the old reader of dreams Eurydamas: they never came\nback for him to read them any more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an\nend of them. He then gave chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of\nPhaenops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with\nage, and begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took\nboth their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he\nnevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided\nhis wealth among themselves.\n\nThen he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as they\nwere both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion fastens on the\nneck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a coppice. For\nall their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and\nstripped the armour from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his\ncomrades to take them back to the ships.\n\nWhen Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went through\nthe fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find Pandarus.\nWhen he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said, \"Pandarus, where is\nnow your bow, your winged arrows, and your renown as an archer, in\nrespect of which no man here can rival you nor is there any in Lycia\nthat can beat you? Lift then your hands to Jove and send an arrow at\nthis fellow who is going so masterfully about, and has done such deadly\nwork among the Trojans. He has killed many a brave man--unless indeed\nhe is some god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices,\nand and has set his hand against them in his displeasure.\"\n\nAnd the son of Lycaon answered, \"Aeneas, I take him for none other than\nthe son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor of his helmet,\nand by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if he is\nthe man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's\nhelp, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of\ndarkness, and who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have\ntaken aim at him already and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow\nwent through the breastpiece of his cuirass; and I made sure I should\nsend him hurrying to the world below, but it seems that I have not\nkilled him. There must be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have\nneither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are eleven\nexcellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths\nspread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,\nchamping barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and again\nwhen I was at home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and\nhorses with me that I might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not\nlisten to him; it would have been much better if I had done so, but I\nwas thinking about the horses, which had been used to eat their fill,\nand I was afraid that in such a great gathering of men they might be\nill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only\nwith my bow and arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have\nalready hit two chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and\nthough I drew blood surely enough, I have only made them still more\nfurious. I did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my\nband of Trojans to Ilius in Hector's service, and if ever I get home\nagain to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness of my\nhouse, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do not break\nthe bow and set it on a hot fire--such pranks as it plays me.\"\n\nAeneas answered, \"Say no more. Things will not mend till we two go\nagainst this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a trial of\narms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses of Tros can\nspeed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or flight. If Jove\nagain vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they will carry us safely\nback to the city. Take hold, then, of the whip and reins while I stand\nupon the car to fight, or else do you wait this man's onset while I\nlook after the horses.\"\n\n\"Aeneas,\" replied the son of Lycaon, \"take the reins and drive; if we\nhave to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go better for\ntheir own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice when they expect\nit they may be frightened, and refuse to take us out of the fight. The\nson of Tydeus will then kill both of us and take the horses. Therefore\ndrive them yourself and I will be ready for him with my spear.\"\n\nThey then mounted the chariot and drove full-speed towards the son of\nTydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and said to Diomed,\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I see two heroes\nspeeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a skilful\narcher, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is\nAnchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount the chariot and let us\nretreat. Do not, I pray you, press so furiously forward, or you may get\nkilled.\"\n\nDiomed looked angrily at him and answered: \"Talk not of flight, for I\nshall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither flight nor\nfear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no mind to mount, but\nwill go against them even as I am; Pallas Minerva bids me be afraid of\nno man, and even though one of them escape, their steeds shall not take\nboth back again. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart--if\nMinerva sees fit to vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your\nhorses here and make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be\nsure you spring Aeneas' horses and drive them from the Trojan to the\nAchaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros in\npayment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and move\nunder the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his mares to\nthem without Laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six foals. Four\nare still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas. We shall\nwin great glory if we can take them.\"\n\nThus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up to\nthem, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. \"Great and mighty son,\" said\nhe, \"of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low, so I will now try\nwith my spear.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck the\nshield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and passed on\ntill it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of Lycaon shouted out\nand said, \"You are hit clean through the belly; you will not stand out\nfor long, and the glory of the fight is mine.\"\n\nBut Diomed all undismayed made answer, \"You have missed, not hit, and\nbefore you two see the end of this matter one or other of you shall\nglut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.\"\n\nWith this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to Pandarus's\nnose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white teeth; the\nbronze point cut through the root of his tongue, coming out under his\nchin, and his glistening armour rang rattling round him as he fell\nheavily to the ground. The horses started aside for fear, and he was\nreft of life and strength.\n\nAeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear, fearing\nlest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode it as a lion\nin the pride of strength, with shield and spear before him and a cry of\nbattle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare face\nhim. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great\nthat as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore\nit aloft with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin\nwhere the hip turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The\nstone crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged\nedges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and propped\nhimself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night\nfell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men, would have perished\nthen and there, had not his mother, Jove's daughter Venus, who had\nconceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been quick to\nmark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son. She\nprotected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.\n\nThus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the son of\nCapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had given him. He\nmade his own horses fast, away from the hurly-burly, by binding the\nreins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas's horses\nand drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so\ndone he gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued\nabove all others as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to\ntake them on to the ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized\nthe reins, and drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.\n\nNow the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess, spear in\nhand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that\ncan lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of\ncities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, he flew\nat her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand. The\npoint tore through the ambrosial robe which the Graces had woven for\nher, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand,\nso that the immortal blood, or ichor, that flows in the veins of the\nblessed gods, came pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat\nbread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are\nimmortal. Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus\nApollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest\nsome Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him; and\nDiomed shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Jove, leave war and\nbattle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women? If\nyou meddle with fighting you will get what will make you shudder at the\nvery name of war.\"\n\nThe goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as the\nwind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair skin all\nbesmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of the battle,\nwith his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a cloud; whereon she\nfell on her knees before her brother and implored him to let her have\nhis horses. \"Dear brother,\" she cried, \"save me, and give me your\nhorses to take me to Olympus where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded\nby a mortal, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with father\nJove.\"\n\nThus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She\nmounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat beside her\nand took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses on and they flew\nforward nothing loth, till in a trice they were at high Olympus, where\nthe gods have their dwelling. There she stayed them, unloosed them from\nthe chariot, and gave them their ambrosial forage; but Venus flung\nherself on to the lap of her mother Dione, who threw her arms about her\nand caressed her, saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings has been\ntreating you in this way, as though you had been doing something wrong\nin the face of day?\"\n\nAnd laughter-loving Venus answered, \"Proud Diomed, the son of Tydeus,\nwounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom I love best\nof all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no longer one between\nTrojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now taken to fighting with\nthe immortals.\"\n\n\"Bear it, my child,\" replied Dione, \"and make the best of it. We\ndwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men, and\nwe lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when Otus and\nEphialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds, so that he lay\nthirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze. Mars would have then\nperished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother to the sons of Aloeus, told\nMercury, who stole him away when he was already well-nigh worn out by\nthe severity of his bondage. Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son\nof Amphitryon wounded her on the right breast with a three-barbed\narrow, and nothing could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades,\nwhen this same man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an\narrow even at the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went\nto the house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the\narrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon\nhealed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades was not\nof mortal mould. Daring, head-strong, evildoer who recked not of his\nsin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And now Minerva has\negged this son of Tydeus on against yourself, fool that he is for not\nreflecting that no man who fights with gods will live long or hear his\nchildren prattling about his knees when he returns from battle. Let,\nthen, the son of Tydeus see that he does not have to fight with one who\nis stronger than you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter\nof Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss of\nher wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.\"\n\nSo saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter with both\nhands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was healed. But Minerva\nand Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt Jove with their mocking\ntalk, and Minerva was first to speak. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"do not\nbe angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading\nsome one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so\nvery fond, and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn\nher delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman's brooch.\"\n\nThe sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his side.\n\"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you to be a warrior.\nAttend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial duties, and\nleave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.\"\n\nThus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he knew\nhim to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he fear the\nmighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and stripping him of his\narmour. Thrice did he spring forward with might and main to slay him,\nand thrice did Apollo beat back his gleaming shield. When he was coming\non for the fourth time, as though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him\nwith an awful voice and said, \"Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off;\nthink not to match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth\ncannot hold their own with the immortals.\"\n\nThe son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the anger\nof the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and set him in\nsacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within the mighty\nsanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him glorious to behold,\nwhile Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of\nAeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked\nat the bucklers about one another's breasts, hewing each other's round\nshields and light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to\nMars, \"Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can\nyou not go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even\nwith father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to\nthe Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and afterwards\nsprang upon me too, as though he were a god.\"\n\nHe then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous Mars went\nabout among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on, in the likeness\nof fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. \"Sons of Priam,\" said he, \"how\nlong will you let your people be thus slaughtered by the Achaeans?\nWould you wait till they are at the walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of\nAnchises has fallen, he whom we held in as high honour as Hector\nhimself. Help me, then, to rescue our brave comrade from the stress of\nthe fight.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then Sarpedon\nrebuked Hector very sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"where is your prowess\nnow? You used to say that though you had neither people nor allies you\ncould hold the town alone with your brothers and brothers-in-law. I see\nnot one of them here; they cower as hounds before a lion; it is we,\nyour allies, who bear the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar,\neven from Lycia and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left\nmy wife, my infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;\nnevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground against any\nwho would fight me though I have nothing here for the Achaeans to\nplunder, while you look on, without even bidding your men stand firm in\ndefence of their wives. See that you fall not into the hands of your\nfoes as men caught in the meshes of a net, and they sack your fair city\nforthwith. Keep this before your mind night and day, and beseech the\ncaptains of your allies to hold on without flinching, and thus put away\ntheir reproaches from you.\"\n\nSo spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang from\nhis chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among the host\nbrandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and raising the\nterrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the Achaeans,\nbut the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back. As\nthe breezes sport with the chaff upon some goodly threshing-floor, when\nmen are winnowing--while yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the\nchaff from the grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter--even\nso did the Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses' hoofs raised\nto the firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to\nbattle, and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to\nhelp the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about\neverywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that\nwhen he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put courage into\nthe hearts of the Trojans--for it was she who was helping the Danaans.\nThen Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his\nheart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who\nwere overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage; but\nthey could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy\nwith the turmoil raised by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in\ntheir midst.\n\nThe two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on, fearless of\nthe fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as still as clouds which\nthe son of Saturn has spread upon the mountain tops when there is no\nair and fierce Boreas sleeps with the other boisterous winds whose\nshrill blasts scatter the clouds in all directions--even so did the\nDanaans stand firm and unflinching against the Trojans. The son of\nAtreus went about among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\" said he,\n\"quit yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another's\neyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more often\nlive than get killed, but they that fly save neither life nor name.\"\n\nAs he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in the\nfront rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus, whom the\nTrojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam, for he was ever\nquick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\nstruck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it\nnot. It drove through his belt into the lower part of his belly, and\nhis armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\n\nThen Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and\nOrsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong city of\nPhere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose broad stream\nflows through the land of the Pylians. The river begat Orsilochus, who\nruled over much people and was father to Diocles, who in his turn begat\ntwin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus, well skilled in all the arts of war.\nThese, when they grew up, went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the\ncause of Menelaus and Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of\nthem fell. As two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some\nmountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and cattle\ntill they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two vanquished\nby Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the ground.\n\nBrave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the\nfront, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for Mars\negged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed by Aeneas;\nbut Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang forward, fearing\nthat the king might come to harm and thus bring all their labour to\nnothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus were setting their hands\nand spears against one another eager to do battle, Antilochus placed\nhimself by the side of Menelaus. Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back\non seeing the two heroes side by side in front of him, so they drew the\nbodies of Crethon and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and\ncommitted the two poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They\nthen turned back and fought in the front ranks.\n\nThey killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian\nwarriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was standing on\nhis chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and squire Mydon, the\nson of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in flight. He hit him with\na stone upon the elbow, and the reins, enriched with white ivory, fell\nfrom his hands into the dust. Antilochus rushed towards him and struck\nhim on the temples with his sword, whereon he fell head first from the\nchariot to the ground. There he stood for a while with his head and\nshoulders buried deep in the dust--for he had fallen on sandy soil till\nhis horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus\nlashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.\n\nBut Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry\nrushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the Trojans.\nMars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with ruthless turmoil of\nbattle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear, and went about, now in\nfront of Hector and now behind him.\n\nDiomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a wide\nplain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great river\nrolling swiftly to the sea--he sees its boiling waters and starts back\nin fear--even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his\nmen, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hector wields the spear so\nwell? Some god is ever by his side to protect him, and now Mars is with\nhim in the likeness of mortal man. Keep your faces therefore towards\nthe Trojans, but give ground backwards, for we dare not fight with\ngods.\"\n\nAs he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men, both\nin one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed in war.\nAjax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came close up and\nhurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of Selagus, a man of great\nwealth who lived in Paesus and owned much corn-growing land, but his\nlot had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck\nhim in the belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he\nfell heavily to the ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of\nhis armour, but the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell\nupon his shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his\nspear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not\nstrip the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,\nmoreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so that\nhe dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove\nhim from them and he was beaten back.\n\nThus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the strong hand\nof fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a man both brave and\nof great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and grandson of\ngreat Jove, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemus spoke first.\n\"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councillor of the Lycians, why should you come\nskulking here you who are a man of peace? They lie who call you son of\naegis-bearing Jove, for you are little like those who were of old his\nchildren. Far other was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father,\nwho came here for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships\nonly, and few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a\nwilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are\nfalling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from\nLycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates of\nHades vanquished by my hand.\"\n\nAnd Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, \"Tlepolemus, your\nfather overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon's folly in refusing\npayment to one who had served him well. He would not give your father\nthe horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for yourself, you\nshall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory to myself, and your\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\n\nThus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They threw at\nthe same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the middle of his\nthroat; the spear went right through, and the darkness of death fell\nupon his eyes. Tlepolemus's spear struck Sarpedon on the left thigh\nwith such force that it tore through the flesh and grazed the bone, but\nhis father as yet warded off destruction from him.\n\nHis comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the\nweight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were in such\nhaste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of drawing the\nspear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly. Meanwhile the\nAchaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus, whereon Ulysses was moved\nto pity, and panted for the fray as he beheld them. He doubted whether\nto pursue the son of Jove, or to make slaughter of the Lycian rank and\nfile; it was not decreed, however, that he should slay the son of Jove;\nMinerva, therefore, turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He\nkilled Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and\nPrytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector marked\nhim, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit of mail,\nfilling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when he saw him\ncoming, and besought him, saying, \"Son of Priam, let me not be here to\nfall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me, and since I may not return\nhome to gladden the hearts of my wife and of my infant son, let me die\nwithin the walls of your city.\"\n\nHector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon the\nAchaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore Sarpedon away\nand laid him beneath Jove's spreading oak tree. Pelagon, his friend and\ncomrade, drew the spear out of his thigh, but Sarpedon fainted and a\nmist came over his eyes. Presently he came to himself again, for the\nbreath of the north wind as it played upon him gave him new life, and\nbrought him out of the deep swoon into which he had fallen.\n\nMeanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by Mars\nand Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew that Mars was\nwith the Trojans they retreated, but kept their faces still turned\ntowards the foe. Who, then, was first and who last to be slain by Mars\nand Hector? They were valiant Teuthras, and Orestes the renowned\ncharioteer, Trechus the Aetolian warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of\nOenops, and Oresbius of the gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great\nwealth, and dwelt by the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who\nlived near him, owners of a fertile country.\n\nNow when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said to\nMinerva, \"Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, the\npromise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he had sacked\nthe city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars rage thus\nfuriously. Let us go into the fray at once.\"\n\nMinerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter of\ngreat Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe with all\nspeed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that were on either\nside of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the wheels were of gold,\nimperishable, and over these there was a tire of bronze, wondrous to\nbehold. The naves of the wheels were silver, turning round the axle\nupon either side. The car itself was made with plaited bands of gold\nand silver, and it had a double top-rail running all round it. From the\nbody of the car there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she\nbound the golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the\nnecks of the horses Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke, eager for\nbattle and the war-cry.\n\nMeanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with her\nown hands, on to her father's threshold, and donned the shirt of Jove,\narming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis about her\nshoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe, and on it were\nStrife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs cold; moreover there\nwas the head of the dread monster Gorgon, grim and awful to behold,\nportent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her head she set her helmet of gold,\nwith four plumes, and coming to a peak both in front and behind--decked\nwith the emblems of a hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming\nchariot and grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with\nwhich she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\nlashed the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew\nopen of their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose\nhands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides\nthem, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient\nsteeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all alone on the topmost\nridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her horses, and spoke to Jove the\nson of Saturn, lord of all. \"Father Jove,\" said she, \"are you not angry\nwith Mars for these high doings? how great and goodly a host of the\nAchaeans he has destroyed to my great grief, and without either right\nor reason, while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their\nease and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I\nhope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard, and\nchase him out of the battle.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him more\noften than any one else does.\"\n\nJuno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew forward\nnothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a man can see when\nhe looks out upon the sea from some high beacon, so far can the\nloud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a single bound. When they\nreached Troy and the place where its two flowing streams Simois and\nScamander meet, there Juno stayed them and took them from the chariot.\nShe hid them in a thick cloud, and Simois made ambrosia spring up for\nthem to eat; the two goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in\ntheir eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where\nthe bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,\nfighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance,\nthere Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of brazen-voiced\nStentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men together.\n\"Argives,\" she cried; \"shame on cowardly creatures, brave in semblance\nonly; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his spear was so deadly that\nthe Trojans dared not show themselves outside the Dardanian gates, but\nnow they sally far from the city and fight even at your ships.\"\n\nWith these words she put heart and soul into them all, while Minerva\nsprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found near his\nchariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had given him. For\nthe sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight of his shield\nirritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain, and he was lifting up\nthe strap to wipe away the blood. The goddess laid her hand on the yoke\nof his horses and said, \"The son of Tydeus is not such another as his\nfather. Tydeus was a little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly\ninto the fray even when I told him not to do so. When he went all\nunattended as envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade\nhim feast in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit\nwhich was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the\nCadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily\ndid I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be\ninstant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are tired out, or you\nare afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no\ntrue son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.\"\n\nDiomed answered, \"I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove,\nand will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of heart, nor\nis there any slackness in me. I am only following your own\ninstructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed gods; but if\nJove's daughter Venus came into battle I was to wound her with my\nspear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding the other Argives gather\nin this place, for I know that Mars is now lording it in the field.\"\n\n\"Diomed, son of Tydeus,\" replied Minerva, \"man after my own heart, fear\nneither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I will befriend you.\nNay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in close combat; fear not\nthis raging madman, villain incarnate, first on one side and then on\nthe other. But now he was holding talk with Juno and myself, saying he\nwould help the Argives and attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with\nthe Trojans, and has forgotten the Argives.\"\n\nWith this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the chariot\non to the ground. In a second he was on the ground, whereupon the\ngoddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of Diomed. The\noaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess and the\nhero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and reins, and drove straight at\nMars. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and\nbravest of the Aetolians. Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour,\nand Minerva donned the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her;\nwhen, therefore, he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let\nPeriphas lie where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close\nquarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke,\nthinking to take Diomed's life, but Minerva caught the spear in her\nhand and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,\nand Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars's stomach where\nhis under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him, tearing his\nfair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars roared as loudly\nas nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the Achaeans\nand Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he raised.\n\nAs a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat, even so\ndid Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad heavens. With\nall speed he reached high Olympus, home of the gods, and in great pain\nsat down beside Jove the son of Saturn. He showed Jove the immortal\nblood that was flowing from his wound, and spoke piteously, saying,\n\"Father Jove, are you not angered by such doings? We gods are\ncontinually suffering in the most cruel manner at one another's hands\nwhile helping mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten\nthat mad termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of\nsome kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you neither\nscold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent creature is\nyour daughter. See how she has been inciting proud Diomed to vent his\nrage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the Cyprian and wounded\nher in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me too as\nthough he were a god. Had I not run for it I must either have lain\nthere for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses, or have\nbeen eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in me.\"\n\nJove looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not come whining here, Sir\nFacing-both-ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in Olympus, for you\nare ever fighting and making mischief. You have the intolerable and\nstubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is all I can do to manage her,\nand it is her doing that you are now in this plight: still, I cannot\nlet you remain longer in such great pain; you are my own offspring, and\nit was by me that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been\nthe son of any other god, you are so destructive that by this time you\nshould have been lying lower than the Titans.\"\n\nHe then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing herbs\nupon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal mould. As the\njuice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a moment though\nit is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe\nwashed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by\nhis father Jove all glorious to behold.\n\nBut Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had put a\nstop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to the house of\nJove.\n\n\n\nBOOK VI\n\n  Glaucus and Diomed--The story of Bellerophon--Hector\n  and Andromache.\n\nTHE fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it\nwould, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the plain as\nthey aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams\nof Simois and Xanthus.\n\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke a\nphalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades by\nkilling Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians, being\nboth brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak\nof his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into the\nbrain, and darkness veiled his eyes.\n\nThen Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived in\nthe strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a\nhouse by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit\nnot one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomed\nkilled both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his\ncharioteer--so the pair passed beneath the earth.\n\nEuryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of\nAesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to noble\nBucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a bastard.\nWhile tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she\nconceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he\nstripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed\nAstyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell\nby the spear of Nestor's son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men,\nkilled Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis.\nLeitus killed Phylacus as he was flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus.\n\nThen Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses\nran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,\nand broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along\nwith the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell in\nthe dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus came up\nto him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees begging for\nhis life. \"Take me alive,\" he cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall have\na full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold,\nbronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. From this store he will\ngive you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at the\nships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to a\nsquire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon came running\nup to him and rebuked him. \"My good Menelaus,\" said he, \"this is no\ntime for giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well at the\nhands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them--not even\nthe child unborn and in its mother's womb; let not a man of them be\nleft alive, but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his words\nwere just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon King\nAgamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then the son of Atreus\nplanted his foot upon his breast to draw his spear from the body.\n\nMeanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, \"My friends, Danaan\nwarriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may spoil the dead,\nand bring back much booty to the ships. Let us kill as many as we can;\nthe bodies will lie upon the plain, and you can despoil them later at\nyour leisure.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the\nTrojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had not\nPriam's son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and Aeneas,\n\"Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the Trojans and\nLycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in fight and counsel;\nhold your ground here, and go about among the host to rally them in\nfront of the gates, or they will fling themselves into the arms of\ntheir wives, to the great joy of our foes. Then, when you have put\nheart into all our companies, we will stand firm here and fight the\nDanaans however hard they press us, for there is nothing else to be\ndone. Meanwhile do you, Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what\nis happening. Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of\nMinerva in the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors\nof the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her lay\nthe largest, fairest robe she has in her house--the one she sets most\nstore by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice twelve yearling\nheifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the\ngoddess, if she will take pity on the town, with the wives and little\nones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from falling on the\ngoodly city of Ilius; for he fights with fury and fills men's souls\nwith panic. I hold him mightiest of them all; we did not fear even\ntheir great champion Achilles, son of a goddess though he be, as we do\nthis man: his rage is beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with\nhim in prowess.\"\n\nHector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot, and\nwent about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears, urging\nthe men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle. Thereon they\nrallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave ground and ceased their\nmurderous onset, for they deemed that some one of the immortals had\ncome down from starry heaven to help the Trojans, so strangely had they\nrallied. And Hector shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans and allies, be\nmen, my friends, and fight with might and main, while I go to Ilius and\ntell the old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and\nvow hecatombs in their honour.\"\n\nWith this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went round\nhis shield beat against his neck and his ancles.\n\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into the\nopen space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When they were\nclose up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was the first to\nspeak. \"Who, my good sir,\" said he, \"who are you among men? I have\nnever seen you in battle until now, but you are daring beyond all\nothers if you abide my onset. Woe to those fathers whose sons face my\nmight. If, however, you are one of the immortals and have come down\nfrom heaven, I will not fight you; for even valiant Lycurgus, son of\nDryas, did not live long when he took to fighting with the gods. He it\nwas that drove the nursing women who were in charge of frenzied Bacchus\nthrough the land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as\nmurderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus himself plunged\nterror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to her bosom to\ncomfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which the man reviled\nhim. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry with Lycurgus and the\nson of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he live much longer after he\nhad become hateful to the immortals. Therefore I will not fight with\nthe blessed gods; but if you are of them that eat the fruit of the\nground, draw near and meet your doom.\"\n\nAnd the son of Hippolochus answered, \"son of Tydeus, why ask me of my\nlineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees. Those\nof autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns the\nforest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations\nof mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away. If, then,\nyou would learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many. There\nis a city in the heart of Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra,\nwhere Sisyphus lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the\nson of Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to\nBellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing comeliness\nand beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being stronger than he,\ndrove him from the land of the Argives, over which Jove had made him\nruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had\nhim lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honourable man and\nwould not, so she told lies about him to Proteus. 'Proetus,' said she,\n'kill Bellerophon or die, for he would have had converse with me\nagainst my will.' The king was angered, but shrank from killing\nBellerophon, so he sent him to Lycia with lying letters of\nintroduction, written on a folded tablet, and containing much ill\nagainst the bearer. He bade Bellerophon show these letters to his\nfather-in-law, to the end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon\ntherefore went to Lycia, and the gods convoyed him safely.\n\n\"When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king\nreceived him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine\nheifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the\ntenth day, he questioned him and desired to see the letter from his\nson-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked letter he first\ncommanded Bellerophon to kill that savage monster, the Chimaera, who\nwas not a human being, but a goddess, for she had the head of a lion\nand the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a goat, and she\nbreathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was\nguided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymi, and\nthis, he said, was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed\nthe Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning\nthence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he picked\nthe bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in ambuscade, but\nnot a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed every one of them.\nThen the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of a god, so\nhe kept him in Lycia, gave him his daughter in marriage, and made him\nof equal honour in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him a\npiece of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and\ntilled fields, to have and to hold.\n\n\"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,\nHippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with\nLaodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came\nto be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon\nthe Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of\nman. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was\nfighting the Solymi; his daughter was killed by Diana of the golden\nreins, for she was angered with her; but Hippolochus was father to\nmyself, and when he sent me to Troy he urged me again and again to\nfight ever among the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shame\nthe blood of my fathers who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all\nLycia. This, then, is the descent I claim.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted his\nspear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words. \"Then,\" he\nsaid, \"you are an old friend of my father's house. Great Oeneus once\nentertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged\npresents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple, and Bellerophon a double\ncup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy. I do not remember\nTydeus, for he was taken from us while I was yet a child, when the army\nof the Achaeans was cut to pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I\nmust be your host in middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia, if I should\never go there; let us avoid one another's spears even during a general\nengagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies whom I can kill, if\nI overtake them and heaven delivers them into my hand; so again with\nyourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives you may take if you can;\nwe two, then, will exchange armour, that all present may know of the\nold ties that subsist between us.\"\n\nWith these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one another's\nhands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn made Glaucus take\nleave of his wits, for he exchanged golden armour for bronze, the worth\nof a hundred head of cattle for the worth of nine.\n\nNow when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the wives\nand daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to ask after\ntheir sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told them to set about\npraying to the gods, and many were made sorrowful as they heard him.\n\nPresently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned with\ncolonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty bedchambers--all of\nhewn stone--built near one another, where the sons of Priam slept, each\nwith his wedded wife. Opposite these, on the other side the courtyard,\nthere were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam's daughters,\nbuilt near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their wives.\nWhen Hector got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice the\nfairest of her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said,\n\"My son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the Achaeans,\nwoe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that you have thought\nfit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from the citadel? Wait till I\ncan bring you wine that you may make offering to Jove and to the other\nimmortals, and may then drink and be refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh\nstrength when he is wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of\nyour kinsmen.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you unman me\nand I forget my strength. I dare not make a drink-offering to Jove with\nunwashed hands; one who is bespattered with blood and filth may not\npray to the son of Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with\nofferings to the temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon the\nknees of Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your\nhouse--the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice\ntwelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the\ntemple of the goddess if she will take pity on the town, with the wives\nand little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of Tydeus from off the\ngoodly city of Ilius, for he fights with fury, and fills men's souls\nwith panic. Go, then, to the temple of Minerva, while I seek Paris and\nexhort him, if he will hear my words. Would that the earth might open\nher jaws and swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane of the\nTrojans, and of Priam and Priam's sons. Could I but see him go down\ninto the house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.\"\n\nHis mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who\ngathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into her\nfragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept, the work of\nSidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from Sidon when he\nsailed the seas upon that voyage during which he carried off Helen.\nHecuba took out the largest robe, and the one that was most beautifully\nenriched with embroidery, as an offering to Minerva: it glittered like\na star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. With this she went on\nher way and many matrons with her.\n\nWhen they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter of\nCisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans had made\nher priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their hands to the\ngoddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to lay it upon the\nknees of Minerva, praying the while to the daughter of great Jove.\n\"Holy Minerva,\" she cried, \"protectress of our city, mighty goddess,\nbreak the spear of Diomed and lay him low before the Scaean gates. Do\nthis, and we will sacrifice twelve heifers that have never yet known\nthe goad, in your temple, if you will have pity upon the town, with the\nwives and little ones of the Trojans.\" Thus she prayed, but Pallas\nMinerva granted not her prayer.\n\nWhile they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove, Hector went\nto the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built for him by the\nforemost builders in the land. They had built him his house,\nstorehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and Hector on the\nacropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven cubits long in his\nhand; the bronze point gleamed in front of him, and was fastened to the\nshaft of the spear by a ring of gold. He found Alexandrus within the\nhouse, busied about his armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling\nhis curved bow; there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting\nthem their several tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with\nwords of scorn. \"Sir,\" said he, \"you do ill to nurse this rancour; the\npeople perish fighting round this our town; you would yourself chide\none whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then, or ere long\nthe city will be in a blaze.\"\n\nAnd Alexandrus answered, \"Hector, your rebuke is just; listen\ntherefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so much\nthrough rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a desire to\nindulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me to battle, and\nI hold it better that I should go, for victory is ever fickle. Wait,\nthen, while I put on my armour, or go first and I will follow. I shall\nbe sure to overtake you.\"\n\nHector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. \"Brother,\" said\nshe, \"to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind had caught\nme up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had borne me to some\nmountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that should have swept me\naway ere this mischief had come about. But, since the gods have devised\nthese evils, would, at any rate, that I had been wife to a better\nman--to one who could smart under dishonour and men's evil speeches.\nThis fellow was never yet to be depended upon, nor never will be, and\nhe will surely reap what he has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest\nupon this seat, for it is you who bear the brunt of that toil that has\nbeen caused by my hateful self and by the sin of Alexandrus--both of\nwhom Jove has doomed to be a theme of song among those that shall be\nborn hereafter.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the goodwill\nyou bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the Trojans, who miss\nme greatly when I am not among them; but urge your husband, and of his\nown self also let him make haste to overtake me before I am out of the\ncity. I must go home to see my household, my wife and my little son,\nfor I know not whether I shall ever again return to them, or whether\nthe gods will cause me to fill by the hands of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThen Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did not\nfind Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and one of her\nmaids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was not within, he\nstood on the threshold of the women's rooms and said, \"Women, tell me,\nand tell me true, where did Andromache go when she left the house? Was\nit to my sisters, or to my brothers' wives? or is she at the temple of\nMinerva where the other women are propitiating the awful goddess?\"\n\nHis good housekeeper answered, \"Hector, since you bid me tell you\ntruly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers' wives, nor\nyet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women are propitiating\nthe awful goddess, but she is on the high wall of Ilius, for she had\nheard the Trojans were being hard pressed, and that the Achaeans were\nin great force: she went to the wall in frenzied haste, and the nurse\nwent with her carrying the child.\"\n\nHector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and went down\nthe streets by the same way that he had come. When he had gone through\nthe city and had reached the Scaean gates through which he would go out\non to the plain, his wife came running towards him, Andromache,\ndaughter of great Eetion who ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes of\nMt. Placus, and was king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married\nHector, and now came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little\nchild in her bosom--a mere babe. Hector's darling son, and lovely as a\nstar. Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called him\nAstyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius. Hector\nsmiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and Andromache\nstood by him weeping and taking his hand in her own. \"Dear husband,\"\nsaid she, \"your valour will bring you to destruction; think on your\ninfant son, and on my hapless self who ere long shall be your\nwidow--for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body and kill you. It\nwould be better for me, should I lose you, to lie dead and buried, for\nI shall have nothing left to comfort me when you are gone, save only\nsorrow. I have neither father nor mother now. Achilles slew my father\nwhen he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew him, but\ndid not for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him in his\nwondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the mountain\nnymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove of elms about\nhis tomb. I had seven brothers in my father's house, but on the same\nday they all went within the house of Hades. Achilles killed them as\nthey were with their sheep and cattle. My mother--her who had been\nqueen of all the land under Mt. Placus--he brought hither with the\nspoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer-queen Diana took\nher in the house of your father. Nay--Hector--you who to me are father,\nmother, brother, and dear husband--have mercy upon me; stay here upon\nthis wall; make not your child fatherless, and your wife a widow; as\nfor the host, place them near the fig-tree, where the city can be best\nscaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice have the bravest of them come\nthither and assailed it, under the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, the sons of\nAtreus, and the brave son of Tydeus, either of their own bidding, or\nbecause some soothsayer had told them.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but with\nwhat face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I shirked\nbattle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save to fight\nbravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown alike for my\nfather and myself. Well do I know that the day will surely come when\nmighty Ilius shall be destroyed with Priam and Priam's people, but I\ngrieve for none of these--not even for Hecuba, nor King Priam, nor for\nmy brothers many and brave who may fall in the dust before their\nfoes--for none of these do I grieve as for yourself when the day shall\ncome on which some one of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of your\nfreedom, and bear you weeping away. It may be that you will have to ply\nthe loom in Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to fetch water from\nthe springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally by some cruel\ntask-master; then will one say who sees you weeping, 'She was wife to\nHector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during the war before\nIlius.' On this your tears will break forth anew for him who would have\nput away the day of captivity from you. May I lie dead under the barrow\nthat is heaped over my body ere I hear your cry as they carry you into\nbondage.\"\n\nHe stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and nestled\nin his nurse's bosom, scared at the sight of his father's armour, and\nat the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his helmet. His\nfather and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took the helmet from\nhis head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took his\ndarling child, kissed him, and dandled him in his arms, praying over\nhim the while to Jove and to all the gods. \"Jove,\" he cried, \"grant\nthat this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans; let\nhim be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule Ilius with his\nmight. Then may one say of him as he comes from battle, 'The son is far\nbetter than the father.' May he bring back the blood-stained spoils of\nhim whom he has laid low, and let his mother's heart be glad.\"\n\nWith this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who took him\nto her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her husband\nwatched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her fondly,\nsaying, \"My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.\nNo one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man's hour\nis come, be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when\nhe has once been born. Go, then, within the house, and busy yourself\nwith your daily duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of\nyour servants; for war is man's matter, and mine above all others of\nthem that have been born in Ilius.\"\n\nHe took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back again\nto her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back towards him. When\nshe reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade them all\njoin in her lament; so they mourned Hector in his own house though he\nwas yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see him return\nsafe from battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans.\n\nParis did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly armour\noverlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast as his feet\ncould take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks loose and gallops\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to bathe in the\nfair-flowing river--he holds his head high, and his mane streams upon\nhis shoulders as he exults in his strength and flies like the wind to\nthe haunts and feeding ground of the mares--even so went forth Paris\nfrom high Pergamus, gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and he\nlaughed aloud as he sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came upon his\nbrother Hector, who was then turning away from the place where he had\nheld converse with his wife, and he was himself the first to speak.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I fear that I have kept you waiting when you are in\nhaste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.\"\n\n\"My good brother,\" answered Hector, \"you fight bravely, and no man with\nany justice can make light of your doings in battle. But you are\ncareless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart to hear the\nill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have suffered much on\nyour account. Let us be going, and we will make things right hereafter,\nshould Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup of our deliverance before\never-living gods of heaven in our own homes, when we have chased the\nAchaeans from Troy.\"\n\n\n\nBOOK VII\n\n  Hector and Ajax fight--Hector is getting worsted when night\n  comes on and parts them--They exchange presents--The\n  burial of the dead, and the building of a wall round their\n  ships by the Achaeans--The Achaeans buy their wine of\n  Agamemnon and Menelaus.\n\nWITH these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother\nAlexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a\nbreeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have\nlaboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so welcome\nwas the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.\n\nThereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived in\nArne, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa. Hector\nthrew a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the neck\nunder the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, moreover, son of\nHippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smote\nIphinous son of Dexius on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his\nchariot behind his fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and\nthere was no life left in him.\n\nWhen, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the Argives, she\ndarted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus, and Apollo, who was\nlooking on from Pergamus, went out to meet her; for he wanted the\nTrojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo\nson of Jove was first to speak. \"What would you have,\" said he,\n\"daughter of great Jove, that your proud spirit has sent you hither\nfrom Olympus? Have you no pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline\nthe scales of victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade\nyou--for it will be better thus--stay the combat for to-day, but let\nthem renew the fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius,\nsince you goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.\"\n\nAnd Minerva answered, \"So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind that I\ncame down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell me, then, how\ndo you propose to end this present fighting?\"\n\nApollo, son of Jove, replied, \"Let us incite great Hector to challenge\nsome one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the Achaeans will be\nshamed into finding a man who will fight him.\"\n\nMinerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of the\ngods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, \"Hector son of Priam,\npeer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then persuade you.\nBid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats, and\nchallenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat.\nI have heard the voice of the ever-living gods, and the hour of your\ndoom is not yet come.\"\n\nHector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the\nTrojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and they\nall sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated. But Minerva\nand Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Jove's high\noak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together,\nbristling with shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west\nwind furs the face of the sea and the waters grow dark beneath it, so\nsat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector\nspoke thus:--\n\n\"Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded;\nJove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing,\nand foreshadows ill for both of us, till you either take the towers of\nTroy, or are yourselves vanquished at your ships. The princes of the\nAchaeans are here present in the midst of you; let him, then, that will\nfight me stand forward as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and\nmay Jove be witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip\nme of my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body\nhome that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when\nI am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and I slay your\nchampion, I will strip him of his armour and take it to the city of\nIlius, where I will hang it in the temple of Apollo, but I will give up\nhis body, that the Achaeans may bury him at their ships, and the build\nhim a mound by the wide waters of the Hellespont. Then will one say\nhereafter as he sails his ship over the sea, 'This is the monument of\none who died long since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.'\nThus will one say, and my fame shall not be lost.\"\n\nThus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to decline\nthe challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last Menelaus rose and\nrebuked them, for he was angry. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"vain braggarts,\nwomen forsooth not men, double-dyed indeed will be the stain upon us if\nno man of the Danaans will now face Hector. May you be turned every man\nof you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in\nyour places. I will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of\nthe fight will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.\"\n\nWith these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your life\nwould have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector, for he was\nfar better the man, had not the princes of the Achaeans sprung upon you\nand checked you. King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand and said,\n\"Menelaus, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of\npassion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself\nas Hector son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.\nEven Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from\nmeeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans will\nsend some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond of battle\nthough he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes\nout alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.\"\n\nWith these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,\nwhereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his shoulders.\nThen Nestor rose and spoke, \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"the Achaean land is\nfallen upon evil times. The old knight Peleus, counsellor and orator\namong the Myrmidons, loved when I was in his house to question me\nconcerning the race and lineage of all the Argives. How would it not\ngrieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before Hector? Many a\ntime would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave his\nbody and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove,\nMinerva, and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the\nPylians and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon\nunder the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river\nIardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their champion,\nwith the armour of King Areithous upon his shoulders--Areithous whom\nmen and women had surnamed 'the Mace-man,' because he fought neither\nwith bow nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron\nmace. Lycurgus killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in\na narrow way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was\ntoo quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to\nearth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which Mars\nhad given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when he grew\nold and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire Ereuthalion,\nwho in this same armour challenged the foremost men among us. The\nothers quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade me fight him though\nnone other would venture; I was the youngest man of them all; but when\nI fought him Minerva vouchsafed me victory. He was the biggest and\nstrongest man that ever I killed, and covered much ground as he lay\nsprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young and strong as I\nthen was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who would face\nhim. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of\nyou any stomach for fighting Hector.\"\n\nThus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started to\ntheir feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after him brave\nDiomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men clothed in\nvalour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his brother\nin arms. After these Eurypylus son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of\nAndraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then Nestor knight of Gerene again\nspoke, saying: \"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he\ncome alive out of this fight he will have done good service alike to\nhis own soul and to the Achaeans.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had thrown\nit into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people lifted their\nhands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the\nvault of heaven, \"Father Jove, grant that the lot fall on Ajax, or on\nthe son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich Mycene himself.\"\n\nAs they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet, and\nfrom it there fell the very lot which they wanted--the lot of Ajax. The\nherald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains of the\nAchaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.\nWhen, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon it\nand had put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the\nherald gave him the lot. When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was\nglad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the lot is mine,\nand I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour;\nmeanwhile, pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the\nTrojans may not hear you--or aloud if you will, for we fear no man.\nNone shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born\nand bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.\"\n\nWith this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and thus\nwould one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father\nJove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power, vouchsafe victory to\nAjax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hector also\nand would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess.\"\n\nThus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming\nbronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Mars\nwhen he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with one\nanother--even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans, spring forward\nwith a grim smile on his face as he brandished his long spear and\nstrode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but the\nTrojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hector beat\nquickly, but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks\nbehind him, for he had been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his\nshield in front of him like a wall--a shield of bronze with seven folds\nof oxhide--the work of Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the\nbest worker in leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed\nbulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding\nthis shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,\nand menaced him saying, \"Hector, you shall now learn, man to man, what\nkind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\nAchilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in\nanger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us\nwho are well able to face you; therefore begin the fight.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the host,\ntreat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that cannot fight.\nI have been long used to the blood and butcheries of battle. I am quick\nto turn my leathern shield either to right or left, for this I deem the\nmain thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots and horsemen, and\nin hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would\nnot take such a man as you are off his guard--but I will smite you\nopenly if I can.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It struck the\nsevenfold shield in its outermost layer--the eighth, which was of\nbronze--and went through six of the layers but in the seventh hide it\nstayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the\nson of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and\npressed onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced\nthe shirt against his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life.\nThey then each of them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on\none another like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and\nendurance: the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax's shield, but the\nbronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax then\nsprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear went through\nit and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it gashed\nhis neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hector\ndid not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seized\na stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he\nstruck the shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so that\nthe bronze rang again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone,\nswung it aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of\na rock broke Hector's shield inwards and threw him down on his back\nwith the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at once.\nThereon they would have hacked at one another in close combat with\ntheir swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and men, come\nforward, one from the Trojans and the other from the\nAchaeans--Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these\nparted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said, \"My\nsons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dear\nto Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of\nnight may not be well gainsaid.\"\n\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it was he\nthat challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I will accept his\nsaying.\"\n\nThen Hector said, \"Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and\nstrength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all others\nof the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will\nfight anew till heaven decide between us, and give victory to one or to\nthe other; night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be\nwell gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at your ships,\nand more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while I,\nin the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their\nwomen, who vie with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us,\nmoreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and\nTrojans, 'They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and\nparted in friendship.'\"\n\nOn this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and\nleathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with\npurple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans,\nand the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their\nhero come to them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty\nAjax. They led him, therefore, to the city as one that had been saved\nbeyond their hopes. On the other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated\nwith victory to Agamemnon.\n\nWhen they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon\nsacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the son of\nSaturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into\njoints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them\non the spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off.\nWhen they had done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it,\nand every man had his full and equal share, so that all were satisfied,\nand King Agamemnon gave Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin,\nas a mark of special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\ndrink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with\nall sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:--\n\n\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the Achaeans\nare now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of the Scamander,\nand their souls have gone down to the house of Hades, it will be well\nwhen morning comes that we should cease fighting; we will then wheel\nour dead together with oxen and mules and burn them not far from the\nships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of our comrades\nhome to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow\nthat shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us\nset about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and\nlet it have well-made gates that there may be a way through them for\nour chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to\nkeep off both horse and foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear\nhard upon us.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and the princess shouted in applause. Meanwhile the\nTrojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the acropolis by\nthe gates of King Priam's palace; and wise Antenor spoke. \"Hear me,\" he\nsaid, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am\nminded. Let us give up Argive Helen and her wealth to the sons of\nAtreus, for we are now fighting in violation of our solemn covenants,\nand shall not prosper till we have done as I say.\"\n\nHe then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to speak.\n\"Antenor,\" said he, \"your words are not to my liking; you can find a\nbetter saying than this if you will; if, however, you have spoken in\ngood earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of your reason. I will\nspeak plainly, and hereby notify to the Trojans that I will not give up\nthe woman; but the wealth that I brought home with her from Argos I\nwill restore, and will add yet further of my own.\"\n\nOn this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the race of\nDardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all sincerity and\ngoodwill addressed them thus: \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians, and\nallies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get your suppers now as\nhitherto throughout the city, but keep your watches and be wakeful. At\ndaybreak let Idaeus go to the ships, and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus\nsons of Atreus the saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has\ncome about; and let him also be instant with them that they now cease\nfighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till\nheaven decide between us and give victory to one or to the other.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took supper\nin their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to the ships. He\nfound the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at the stern of\nAgamemnon's ship, and took his place in the midst of them. \"Son of\nAtreus,\" he said, \"and princes of the Achaean host, Priam and the other\nnoble Trojans have sent me to tell you the saying of Alexandrus through\nwhom this quarrel has come about, if so be that you may find it\nacceptable. All the treasure he took with him in his ships to\nTroy--would that he had sooner perished--he will restore, and will add\nyet further of his own, but he will not give up the wedded wife of\nMenelaus, though the Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me\ninquire further if you will cease fighting till we burn our dead;\nhereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give\nvictory to one or to the other.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud war-cry\nspoke, saying, \"Let there be no taking, neither treasure, nor yet\nHelen, for even a child may see that the doom of the Trojans is at\nhand.\"\n\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that Diomed had\nspoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus, \"Idaeus, you have\nheard the answer the Achaeans make you-and I with them. But as\nconcerning the dead, I give you leave to burn them, for when men are\nonce dead there should be no grudging them the rites of fire. Let Jove\nthe mighty husband of Juno be witness to this covenant.\"\n\nAs he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods, and\nIdaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and\nDardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he came,\nhe stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon as they\nheard it they set about their twofold labour, some to gather the\ncorpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on their part also\nhastened from their ships, some to gather the corpses, and others to\nbring in wood.\n\nThe sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into the\nvault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus, when the\ntwo armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead, but they washed\nthe clotted gore from off them, shed tears over them, and lifted them\nupon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so\nthey heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having\nburned them went back to the city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner\nheaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned\nthem went back to their ships.\n\nNow in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the\nAchaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that was\nraised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to\nshelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that\nthere might be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside\nit they dug a trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with\nstakes.\n\nThus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of Jove\nthe lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but Neptune, lord\nof the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Jove, what mortal in the\nwhole world will again take the gods into his counsel? See you not how\nthe Achaeans have built a wall about their ships and driven a trench\nall round it, without offering hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this\nwall will reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think\nanything of the one which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much\nlabour for Laomedon.\"\n\nJove was displeased and answered, \"What, O shaker of the earth, are you\ntalking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be alarmed at\nwhat they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as dawn itself.\nSurely when the Achaeans have gone home with their ships, you can\nshatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you can cover the beach\nwith sand again, and the great wall of the Achaeans will then be\nutterly effaced.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans was\ncompleted; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got their\nsupper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by Euneus the\nson of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of Jason freighted them\nwith ten thousand measures of wine, which he sent specially to the sons\nof Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus. From this supply the Achaeans bought\ntheir wine, some with bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some\nwith whole heifers, and some again with captives. They spread a goodly\nbanquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans\nand their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill and\nroared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon them, and\nthey spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground, nor did any\ndare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of Saturn.\nThen they laid themselves down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII\n\n  Jove forbids the gods to interfere further--There is an even\n  fight till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory\n  in favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans\n  within their wall--Juno and Minerva set out to help the\n  Trojans: Jove sends Iris to turn them back, but later on\n  he promises Juno that she shall have her way in the end--Hector's\n  triumph is stayed by nightfall--The Trojans bivouac on the plain.\n\nNOW when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to suffuse\nlight over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on the topmost\ncrest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the other gods gave\near. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as\nI am minded. Let none of you neither goddess nor god try to cross me,\nbut obey me every one of you that I may bring this matter to an end. If\nI see anyone acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he\nshall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I\nwill hurl him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under\nthe earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as far\nbeneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may learn how\nmuch the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out for yourselves.\nHangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold of it all of you,\ngods and goddesses together--tug as you will, you will not drag Jove\nthe supreme counsellor from heaven to earth; but were I to pull at it\nmyself I should draw you up with earth and sea into the bargain, then\nwould I bind the chain about some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all\ndangling in the mid firmament. So far am I above all others either of\ngods or men.\"\n\nThey were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had\nspoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, \"Father, son of\nSaturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be\ngainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are\nperishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid\nus, refrain from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable\nsuggestions to the Argives that they may not all of them perish in your\ndispleasure.\"\n\nJove smiled at her and answered, \"Take heart, my child, Trito-born; I\nam not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you.\"\n\nWith this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes of\nglittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about the body,\nseized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he\nlashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth\nand starry heaven. After a while he reached many-fountained Ida, mother\nof wild beasts, and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar.\nThere the father of gods and men stayed his horses, took them from the\nchariot, and hid them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all\nglorious upon the topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy\nand the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nThe Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and\nafterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand likewise\narmed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless\neager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the gates\nwere flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with the tramp\nas of a great multitude.\n\nWhen they were got together in one place, shield clashed with shield,\nand spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men. Mighty was the\ndin as the bossed shields pressed hard on one another--death--cry and\nshout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with blood.\n\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their weapons\nbeat against one another, and the people fell, but when the sun had\nreached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his golden scales, and put\ntwo fates of death within them, one for the Trojans and the other for\nthe Achaeans. He took the balance by the middle, and when he lifted it\nup the day of the Achaeans sank; the death-fraught scale of the\nAchaeans settled down upon the ground, while that of the Trojans rose\nheavenwards. Then he thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of\nhis lightning upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell\nupon them and they were sore afraid.\n\nIdomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two Ajaxes,\nservants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of Gerene alone\nstood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own will, but one of\nhis horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen had hit it\nwith an arrow just on the top of its head where the mane begins to grow\naway from the skull, a very deadly place. The horse bounded in his\nanguish as the arrow pierced his brain, and his struggles threw others\ninto confusion. The old man instantly began cutting the traces with his\nsword, but Hector's fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout\nwith their bold charioteer, even Hector himself, and the old man would\nhave perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and\nwith a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.\n\n\"Ulysses,\" he cried, \"noble son of Laertes where are you flying to,\nwith your back turned like a coward? See that you are not struck with a\nspear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me to defend Nestor\nfrom this man's furious onset.\"\n\nUlysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the\nAchaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the thick\nof the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of Neleus.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"these young warriors are pressing you hard, your force\nis spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire is naught, and your\nhorses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and see what the horses of\nTros can do--how cleverly they can scud hither and thither over the\nplain either in flight or in pursuit. I took them from the hero Aeneas.\nLet our squires attend to your own steeds, but let us drive mine\nstraight at the Trojans, that Hector may learn how furiously I too can\nwield my spear.\"\n\nNestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the doughty\nsquires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to Nestor's horses,\nwhile the two both mounted Diomed's chariot. Nestor took the reins in\nhis hands and lashed the horses on; they were soon close up with\nHector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a spear at him as he was charging\nfull speed towards them. He missed him, but struck his charioteer and\nsquire Eniopeus son of noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while\nthe reins were in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the\nhorses swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly\ngrieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all his\nsorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his steeds\nhave to go long without one, for he presently found brave Archeptolemus\nthe son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the horses, giving the\nreins into his hand.\n\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have been\npenned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and men been\nquick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt which fell just\nin front of Diomed's horses with a flare of burning brimstone. The\nhorses were frightened and tried to back beneath the car, while the\nreins dropped from Nestor's hands. Then he was afraid and said to\nDiomed, \"Son of Tydeus, turn your horses in flight; see you not that\nthe hand of Jove is against you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to\nHector; to-morrow, if it so please him, he will again grant it to\nourselves; no man, however brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for\nhe is far stronger than any.\"\n\nDiomed answered, \"All that you have said is true; there is a grief\nhowever which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will talk among\nthe Trojans and say, 'The son of Tydeus fled before me to the ships.'\nThis is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then swallow me.\"\n\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Nestor, \"what mean you? Though Hector say that\nyou are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not believe him, nor\nyet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you have laid low.\"\n\nSo saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the battle,\nand with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector rained their\ndarts after them. Hector shouted to him and said, \"Son of Tydeus, the\nDanaans have done you honour hitherto as regards your place at table,\nthe meals they give you, and the filling of your cup with wine.\nHenceforth they will despise you, for you are become no better than a\nwoman. Be off, girl and coward that you are, you shall not scale our\nwalls through any flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off\nour wives in your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.\"\n\nThe son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his horses\nround again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice did Jove\nthunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans that he would\nturn the battle in their favour. Hector then shouted to them and said,\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, lovers of close fighting, be men, my\nfriends, and fight with might and with main; I see that Jove is minded\nto vouchsafe victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal\ndestruction upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building\nthis weak and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will\nspring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships forget\nnot to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I slaughter the\nArgives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the smoke.\"\n\nThen he cried to his horses, \"Xanthus and Podargus, and you Aethon and\ngoodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all the honey-sweet\ncorn with which Andromache daughter of great Eetion has fed you, and\nfor she has mixed wine and water for you to drink whenever you would,\nbefore doing so even for me who am her own husband. Haste in pursuit,\nthat we may take the shield of Nestor, the fame of which ascends to\nheaven, for it is of solid gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may\nstrip from the shoulders of Diomed the cuirass which Vulcan made him.\nCould we take these two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their\nships this self-same night.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she shook\nwith rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god of Neptune,\n\"What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can you find no\ncompassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who bring you many a\nwelcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish them well then. If all of\nus who are with the Danaans were to drive the Trojans back and keep\nJove from helping them, he would have to sit there sulking alone on\nIda.\"\n\nKing Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, \"Juno, rash of tongue,\nwhat are you talking about? We other gods must not set ourselves\nagainst Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.\"\n\nThus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the ditch, from\nthe ships even to the wall, was filled with horses and warriors, who\nwere pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now that the hand of Jove\nwas with him. He would even have set fire to the ships and burned them,\nhad not Queen Juno put it into the mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself\nand to encourage the Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and\ntents carrying a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge\nblack hull of Ulysses' ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from\nthis place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand towards\nthe tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of\nAchilles--for these two heroes, well assured of their own strength, had\nvalorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. From this\nspot then, with a voice that could be heard afar, he shouted to the\nDanaans, saying, \"Argives, shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in\nsemblance only; where are now our vaunts that we should prove\nvictorious--the vaunts we made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate\nthe flesh of horned cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You\nvowed that you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred\nmen, and now you prove no match even for one--for Hector, who will be\nere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever so\nruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness? Yet, when to\nmy sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship pass your altars\nwithout offering the fat and thigh-bones of heifers upon every one of\nthem, so eager was I to sack the city of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this\nprayer--suffer us to escape at any rate with our lives, and let not the\nAchaeans be so utterly vanquished by the Trojans.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him that\nhis people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them an eagle, most\nunfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young fawn in its talons;\nthe eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on which the Achaeans\nsacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; when, therefore, the people saw\nthat the bird had come from Jove, they sprang more fiercely upon the\nTrojans and fought more boldly.\n\nThere was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast that he\nhad driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to fight sooner\nthan the son of Tydeus; long before any one else could do so he slew an\narmed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the son of Phradmon. He had\nturned his horses in flight, but the spear struck him in the back\nmidway between his shoulders and went right through his chest, and his\narmour rang rattling round him as he fell forward from his chariot.\n\nAfter him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two Ajaxes\nclothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his companion in\narms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus the brave son of\nEuaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and took his place under cover\nof the shield of Ajax son of Telamon. When Ajax lifted his shield\nTeucer would peer round, and when he had hit any one in the throng, the\nman would fall dead; then Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to\nits mother, and again duck down under his shield.\n\nWhich of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and then\nOrmenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike Lycophontes,\nAmopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. All these in turn did he lay\nlow upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was glad when he saw him making\nhavoc of the Trojans with his mighty bow. He went up to him and said,\n\"Teucer, man after my own heart, son of Telamon, captain among the\nhost, shoot on, and be at once the saving of the Danaans and the glory\nof your father Telamon, who brought you up and took care of you in his\nown house when you were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him\nwith glory though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly\nperform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the city of\nIlius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after my own--a\ntripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who shall go up\ninto your bed.\"\n\nAnd Teucer answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge me;\nfrom the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have never\nceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can shoot and\nkill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them have been buried\nin the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog I cannot hit.\"\n\nAs he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was bent\non hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow hit Priam's\nbrave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair Castianeira,\nlovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme, and now he bowed his\nhead as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showers\nin spring--even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his\nhelmet.\n\nAgain he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and again his\narrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit Hector's brave\ncharioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the nipple, as he was\ndriving furiously into the fight. The horses swerved aside as he fell\nheadlong from the chariot, and there was no life left in him. Hector\nwas greatly grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but for all his\nsorrow he let him lie where he fell, and bade his brother Cebriones,\nwho was hard by, take the reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector\nthereon with a loud cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and\nseizing a great stone made straight for Teucer with intent to kill him.\nTeucer had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the\nbow-string, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was\ntaking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him just\nwhere the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a very deadly\nplace, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his wrist was less, and\nthe bow dropped from his hand as he fell forward on his knees. Ajax saw\nthat his brother had fallen, and running towards him bestrode him and\nsheltered him with his shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires,\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships\ngroaning in his great pain.\n\nJove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the Achaeans\nto their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at their head. As a\nhound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or buttock when he gives him\nchase, and watches warily for his wheeling, even so did Hector follow\nclose upon the Achaeans, ever killing the hindmost as they rushed\npanic-stricken onwards. When they had fled through the set stakes and\ntrench and many Achaeans had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans,\nthey halted at their ships, calling upon one another and praying every\nman instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector\nwheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those of\nGorgo or murderous Mars.\n\nJuno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to Minerva,\n\"Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take no more\nthought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time we ever do\nso? See how they perish and come to a bad end before the onset of but a\nsingle man. Hector the son of Priam rages with intolerable fury, and\nhas already done great mischief.\"\n\nMinerva answered, \"Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his own\nland, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father Jove is mad\nwith spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and unjust. He forgets\nhow often I saved his son when he was worn out by the labours\nEurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his cry came up to\nheaven, and then Jove would send me down to help him; if I had had the\nsense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus sent him to the house of\nHades, to fetch the hell-hound from Erebus, he would never have come\nback alive out of the deep waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates\nme, while he lets Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and\ntook hold of his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to\nAchilles. I shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his\ngrey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the house of\naegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then find out whether\nPriam's son Hector will be glad to meet us in the highways of battle,\nor whether the Trojans will glut hounds and vultures with the fat of\ntheir flesh as they be dead by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great Saturn,\nobeyed her words; she set about harnessing her gold-bedizened steeds,\nwhile Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing Jove flung her richly vesture,\nmade with her own hands, on to the threshold of her father, and donned\nthe shirt of Jove, arming herself for battle. Then she stepped into her\nflaming chariot, and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong\nwith which she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno\nlashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open\nof their own accord--gates over which the Hours preside, in whose hands\nare heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that hides them\nor to close it. Through these the goddesses drove their obedient steeds.\n\nBut father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and sent\nwinged Iris with a message to them. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, turn\nthem back, and see that they do not come near me, for if we come to\nfighting there will be mischief. This is what I say, and this is what I\nmean to do. I will lame their horses for them; I will hurl them from\ntheir chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take them all ten\nyears to heal the wounds my lightning shall inflict upon them; my\ngrey-eyed daughter will then learn what quarrelling with her father\nmeans. I am less surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she\nalways contradicts me.\"\n\nWith this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights of Ida\nto the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at the outer\ngates of its many valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\" said she,\n\"are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn forbids going. This is\nwhat he says, and this is what he means to do, he will lame your horses for\nyou, he will hurl you from your chariot, and will break it in pieces.\nIt will take you all ten years to heal the wounds his lightning will\ninflict upon you, that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what\nquarrelling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry with\nJuno, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, bold\nhussy, will you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of\nJove?\"\n\nWith this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, \"Of a truth, child\nof aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men's battles further in\ndefiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will have it, and let\nJove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans and Danaans according to\nhis own pleasure.\"\n\nShe turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made them fast\nto their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot against the end wall\nof the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat down upon their golden\nthrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very angry.\n\nPresently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered the\nassembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses\nfor him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Jove\nthen sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus reeled beneath him.\nMinerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove, and neither spoke nor\nasked him questions, but Jove knew what they meant, and said, \"Minerva\nand Juno, why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many\nof your dear friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might\nof my hands that all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both\nof you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible\ndoings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been--I should\nhave struck you with lightning, and your chariots would never have\nbrought you back again to Olympus.\"\n\nMinerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and brooded\nmischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a word, for she\nwas in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her father; but\nJuno could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of Saturn,\nare you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless we\nhave compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming\nto a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from\nactual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the\nArgives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do so,\nyou will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of the Argives,\nfor fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he has roused the son\nof Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships' sterns\nabout the body of Patroclus. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed;\nfor aught I care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and\nsea, where Iapetus and Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray\nof light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till\nyou get there, and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you\nare the greatest vixen living.\"\n\nJuno made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb now sank into Oceanus\nand drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the Trojans when\nlight failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness fall\nupon the Achaeans.\n\nThen Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a council on\nthe open space near the river, where there was a spot clear of corpses.\nThey left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear the speech\nhe made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze point\nof which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head\nwas of gold. Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans,\nDardanians, and allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the\nships and all the Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but\ndarkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\nships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of\nnight, and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots\nand give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep and\ncattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your horses and\ngather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose\nflare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to fly beyond the\nsea by night, and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many\na man among them must take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with\nspear or arrow as he is leaping on board his ship, that others may fear\nto bring war and weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds\ntell it about the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men are\nto camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a\ngreat fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the town be\nentered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it, brave\nTrojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at\ndaybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to Jove and to the\ngods that we may then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for\n'tis the fates that have borne them and their ships hither. This night,\ntherefore, let us keep watch, but with early morning let us put on our\narmour and rouse fierce war at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then\nknow whether brave Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from the\nships to the wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his\nbloodstained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my spear\nif he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among the first to\nfall and many another of his comrades round him. Would that I were as\nsure of being immortal and never growing old, and of being worshipped\nlike Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this day will bring evil to the\nArgives.\"\n\nThus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took their\nsweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast each by his own\nchariot. They made haste to bring sheep and cattle from the city, they\nbrought wine also and corn from their houses and gathered much wood.\nThey then offered unblemished hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind\ncarried the sweet savour of sacrifice to heaven--but the blessed gods\npartook not thereof, for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and\nPriam's people. Thus high in hope they sat through the livelong night\nby the highways of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when\nthe stars shine clear, and the moon is bright--there is not a breath of\nair, not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in the\nineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the stars can\nall of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is glad--even thus\nshone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius midway between the\nships and the river Xanthus. A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the\nplain, and in the glow of each there sat fifty men, while the horses,\nchamping oats and corn beside their chariots, waited till dawn should\ncome.\n\n\n\nBOOK IX\n\n  The Embassy to Achilles.\n\nTHUS did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained Rout,\nhad taken fast hold of the Achaeans, and their princes were all of them\nin despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace--the north and\nthe northwest--spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of the main--in\na moment the dark waves uprear their heads and scatter their sea-wrack\nin all directions--even thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans.\n\nThe son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a\ncouncil man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made haste also\nhimself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in their assembly.\nAgamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream or cataract on the\nside of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many a heavy sigh he spoke to\nthe Achaeans. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and councillors of the\nArgives, the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove\ngave me his solemn promise that I should sack the city of Troy before\nreturning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me go\ningloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the\nwill of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yet\nlay others, for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let us all do\nas I say and sail back to our own country, for we shall not take Troy.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat\nsorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last Diomed of\nthe loud battle-cry made answer saying, \"Son of Atreus, I will chide\nyour folly, as is my right in council. Be not then aggrieved that I\nshould do so. In the first place you attacked me before all the Danaans\nand said that I was a coward and no soldier. The Argives young and old\nknow that you did so. But the son of scheming Saturn endowed you by\nhalves only. He gave you honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour,\nwhich is the highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir,\nthink you that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and\ncowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going\nhome--go--the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you from\nMycene stand ranged upon the seashore; but the rest of us stay here\ntill we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should turn homeward\nwith their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still fight on till we\nreach the goal of Ilius, for heaven was with us when we came.\"\n\nThe sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed, and\npresently Nestor rose to speak. \"Son of Tydeus,\" said he, \"in war your\nprowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all who are of\nyour own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light of what you say\nnor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the end of the whole\nmatter. You are still young--you might be the youngest of my own\nchildren--still you have spoken wisely and have counselled the chief of\nthe Achaeans not without discretion; nevertheless I am older than you\nand I will tell you everything; therefore let no man, not even King\nAgamemnon, disregard my saying, for he that foments civil discord is a\nclanless, hearthless outlaw.\n\n\"Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our suppers,\nbut let the sentinels every man of them camp by the trench that is\nwithout the wall. I am giving these instructions to the young men; when\nthey have been attended to, do you, son of Atreus, give your orders,\nfor you are the most royal among us all. Prepare a feast for your\ncouncillors; it is right and reasonable that you should do so; there is\nabundance of wine in your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans bring\nfrom Thrace daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith to\nentertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got\ntogether, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest--and sorely\ndo we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit his\nwatchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed? This\nnight will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The sentinels went\nout in their armour under command of Nestor's son Thrasymedes, a\ncaptain of the host, and of the bold warriors Ascalaphus and Ialmenus:\nthere were also Meriones, Aphareus and Deipyrus, and the son of Creion,\nnoble Lycomedes. There were seven captains of the sentinels, and with\neach there went a hundred youths armed with long spears: they took\ntheir places midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had\ndone so they lit their fires and got every man his supper.\n\nThe son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to his\nquarters and prepared a great feast in their honour. They laid their hands\non the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had\nenough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose counsel was ever truest, was\nthe first to lay his mind before them. He, therefore, with all\nsincerity and goodwill addressed them thus.\n\n\"With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, will\nI both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over much people.\nJove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the sceptre and to uphold\nrighteousness, that you may take thought for your people under you;\ntherefore it behooves you above all others both to speak and to give\near, and to out the counsel of another who shall have been minded to\nspeak wisely. All turns on you and on your commands, therefore I will\nsay what I think will be best. No man will be of a truer mind than that\nwhich has been mine from the hour when you, sir, angered Achilles by\ntaking the girl Briseis from his tent against my judgment. I urged you\nnot to do so, but you yielded to your own pride, and dishonoured a hero\nwhom heaven itself had honoured--for you still hold the prize that had\nbeen awarded to him. Now, however, let us think how we may appease him,\nboth with presents and fair speeches that may conciliate him.\"\n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you have reproved my folly justly. I\nwas wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in himself a host,\nand Jove has shown that he befriends this man by destroying much people\nof the Achaeans. I was blinded with passion and yielded to my worser\nmind; therefore I will make amends, and will give him great gifts by\nway of atonement. I will tell them in the presence of you all. I will\ngive him seven tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten\ntalents of gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve\nstrong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed,\nboth in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses have\nwon me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom I\nchose for myself when he took Lesbos--all of surpassing beauty. I will\ngive him these, and with them her whom I erewhile took from him, the\ndaughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath that I never went up into\nher couch, nor have been with her after the manner of men and women.\n\n\"All these things will I give him now, and if hereafter the gods\nvouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we Achaeans\nare dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and bronze to his\nliking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan women, the loveliest\nafter Helen herself. Then, when we reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of\nall lands, he shall be my son-in-law and I will show him like honour\nwith my own dear son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. I\nhave three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa, let him\ntake the one of his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the\nhouse of Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave\nhis daughter, and will give him seven well established cities,\nCardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and the\nrich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of\nPedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men\nthat dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour him\nwith gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to his comfortable\nordinances. All this will I do if he will now forgo his anger. Let him\nthen yield; it is only Hades who is utterly ruthless and\nunyielding--and hence he is of all gods the one most hateful to\nmankind. Moreover I am older and more royal than himself. Therefore,\nlet him now obey me.\"\n\nThen Nestor answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,\nAgamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then send\nchosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of Peleus\nwithout delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let Phoenix, dear to\nJove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow, and let the heralds\nOdius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring water for our hands, and\nbid all keep silence while we pray to Jove the son of Saturn, if so be\nthat he may have mercy upon us.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants\npoured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the\nmixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving\nevery man his drink-offering; then, when they had made their offerings,\nand had drunk each as much as he was minded, the envoys set out from\nthe tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and Nestor, looking first to one\nand then to another, but most especially at Ulysses, was instant with\nthem that they should prevail with the noble son of Peleus.\n\nThey went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed\nearnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the son\nof Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they reached the\nships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles playing on a\nlyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its cross-bar was of silver. It\nwas part of the spoils which he had taken when he sacked the city of\nEetion, and he was now diverting himself with it and singing the feats\nof heroes. He was alone with Patroclus, who sat opposite to him and\nsaid nothing, waiting till he should cease singing. Ulysses and Ajax\nnow came in--Ulysses leading the way--and stood before him. Achilles\nsprang from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and Patroclus,\nwhen he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted them\nsaying, \"All hail and welcome--you must come upon some great matter,\nyou, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered with\npurple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him, \"Son of\nMenoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less water with the\nwine, and give every man his cup, for these are very dear friends, who\nare now under my roof.\"\n\nPatroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block in\nfront of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the loin also\nof a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held the meat while\nAchilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and put them on spits\nwhile the son of Menoetius made the fire burn high. When the flame had\ndied down, he spread the embers, laid the spits on top of them, lifting\nthem up and setting them upon the spit-racks; and he sprinkled them\nwith salt. When the meat was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed\nbread round the table in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their\nportions. Then Achilles took his seat facing Ulysses against the\nopposite wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus offer sacrifice to the\ngods; so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their hands\nupon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had\nenough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign to Phoenix, and when he saw\nthis, Ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged Achilles.\n\n\"Hail,\" said he, \"Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer, neither\nin the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been plenty to eat\nand drink, but our thought turns upon no such matter. Sir, we are in\nthe face of great disaster, and without your help know not whether we\nshall save our fleet or lose it. The Trojans and their allies have\ncamped hard by our ships and by the wall; they have lit watchfires\nthroughout their host and deem that nothing can now prevent them from\nfalling on our fleet. Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their\nright; Hector, in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that\nJove is with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad,\nand prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the high\nsterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and make havoc\nof the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in smoke; I much\nfear that heaven will make good his boasting, and it will prove our lot\nto perish at Troy far from our home in Argos. Up, then, and late though\nit be, save the sons of the Achaeans who faint before the fury of the\nTrojans. You will repent bitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the\nharm is done there will be no curing it; consider ere it be too late,\nand save the Danaans from destruction.\n\n\"My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to\nAgamemnon, did he not charge you saying, 'Son, Minerva and Juno will\nmake you strong if they choose, but check your high temper, for the\nbetter part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and the Achaeans\nold and young will respect you more for doing so.' These were his\nwords, but you have forgotten them. Even now, however, be appeased, and\nput away your anger from you. Agamemnon will make you great amends if\nyou will forgive him; listen, and I will tell you what he has said in\nhis tent that he will give you. He will give you seven tripods that\nhave never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty iron\ncauldrons, and twelve strong horses that have won races and carried off\nprizes. Rich indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many prizes\nas these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give you seven\nexcellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself, when you took\nLesbos--all of surpassing beauty. He will give you these, and with them\nher whom he erewhile took from you, the daughter of Briseus, and he\nwill swear a great oath, he has never gone up into her couch nor been\nwith her after the manner of men and women. All these things will he\ngive you now down, and if hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the\ncity of Priam, you can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil,\nand load your ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take\ntwenty Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we\nreach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his\nson-in-law, and he will show you like honour with his own dear son\nOrestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon has three\ndaughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you may take the one\nof your choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of\nPeleus; he will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his\ndaughter, and will give you seven well-established cities, Cardamyle,\nEnope, and Hire where there is grass; holy Pheras and the rich meadows\nof Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near\nthe sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there\nare rich in cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though\nwere a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this\nwill he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you hate\nboth him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the rest of the\nAchaeans who are being harassed in all their host; they will honour you\nas a god, and you will earn great glory at their hands. You might even\nkill Hector; he will come within your reach, for he is infatuated, and\ndeclares that not a Danaan whom the ships have brought can hold his own\nagainst him.\"\n\nAchilles answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give you\nformal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there be no\nmore of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come. Him do I\nhate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides\nanother in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean. I will be\nappeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any other of the\nDanaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my fighting. He that\nfights fares no better than he that does not; coward and hero are held\nin equal honour, and death deals like measure to him who works and him\nwho is idle. I have taken nothing by all my hardships--with my life\never in my hand; as a bird when she has found a morsel takes it to her\nnestlings, and herself fares hardly, even so many a long night have I\nbeen wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day against\nthose who were fighting for their women. With my ships I have taken\ntwelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed with my men\nby land; I took great store of wealth from every one of them, but I\ngave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed where he was by his\nships, yet of what came to him he gave little, and kept much himself.\n\n\"Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the\nchieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of the\nAchaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted--let him keep her\nand sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs fight the\nTrojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host and bring them?\nWas it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of Atreus the only men\nin the world who love their wives? Any man of common right feeling will\nlove and cherish her who is his own, as I this woman, with my whole\nheart, though she was but a fruitling of my spear. Agamemnon has taken\nher from me; he has played me false; I know him; let him tempt me no\nfurther, for he shall not move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to\nthe other princes to save his ships from burning. He has done much\nwithout me already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and\nwide all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even\nso he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I fought the\nAchaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from the city walls;\nhe would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak tree, but no further.\nOnce he stayed to meet me and hardly did he escape my onset: now,\nhowever, since I am in no mood to fight him, I will to-morrow offer\nsacrifice to Jove and to all the gods; I will draw my ships into the\nwater and then victual them duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to\nlook, you will see my ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to\nsea with might and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage,\nin three days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that I left\nbehind me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring back still\nfurther store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron, my\nshare of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who gave has\ninsolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you, and tell him in\npublic that the Achaeans may hate him and beware of him should he think\nthat he can yet dupe others for his effrontery never fails him.\n\n\"As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I will\ntake no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in common with\nhim. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he shall not cozen me\nfurther; let him go his own way, for Jove has robbed him of his reason.\nI loathe his presents, and for himself care not one straw. He may offer\nme ten or even twenty times what he has now done, nay--not though it be\nall that he has in the world, both now or ever shall have; he may\npromise me the wealth of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes, which is the\nrichest city in the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through\neach of which two hundred men may drive at once with their chariots and\nhorses; he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea or the dust of\nthe plain in multitude, but even so he shall not move me till I have\nbeen revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will not\nmarry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus, and skilful as Minerva,\nbut I will have none of her: let another take her, who may be a good\nmatch for her and who rules a larger kingdom. If the gods spare me to\nreturn home, Peleus will find me a wife; there are Achaean women in\nHellas and Phthia, daughters of kings that have cities under them; of\nthese I can take whom I will and marry her. Many a time was I minded\nwhen at home in Phthia to woo and wed a woman who would make me a\nsuitable wife, and to enjoy the riches of my old father Peleus. My life\nis more to me than all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace\nbefore the Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on\nthe stone floor of Apollo's temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho. Cattle\nand sheep are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both tripods and\nhorses if he wants them, but when his life has once left him it can\nneither be bought nor harried back again.\n\n\"My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may meet\nmy end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive but my name\nwill live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will die, but it will\nbe long ere death shall take me. To the rest of you, then, I say, 'Go\nhome, for you will not take Ilius.' Jove has held his hand over her to\nprotect her, and her people have taken heart. Go, therefore, as in duty\nbound, and tell the princes of the Achaeans the message that I have\nsent them; tell them to find some other plan for the saving of their\nships and people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one that they\nhave now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here that\nhe may sail with me in the morning if he so will. But I will not take\nhim by force.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which he had\ndenied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his great fear\nfor the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and said, \"Noble\nAchilles, if you are now minded to return, and in the fierceness of\nyour anger will do nothing to save the ships from burning, how, my son,\ncan I remain here without you? Your father Peleus bade me go with you\nwhen he sent you as a mere lad from Phthia to Agamemnon. You knew\nnothing neither of war nor of the arts whereby men make their mark in\ncouncil, and he sent me with you to train you in all excellence of\nspeech and action. Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without\nyou--no, not though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from off\nme, and make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land of\nfair women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son of\nOrmenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine, of\nwhom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother. My mother,\ntherefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the woman myself, that\nso she hate my father, and in the course of time I yielded. But my\nfather soon came to know, and cursed me bitterly, calling the dread\nErinyes to witness. He prayed that no son of mine might ever sit upon\nknees--and the gods, Jove of the world below and awful Proserpine,\nfulfilled his curse. I took counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my\nrashness and bade me think on men's evil tongues and how I should be\nbranded as the murderer of my father; nevertheless I could not bear to\nstay in my father's house with him so bitter against me. My cousins\nand clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a\nsheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did they\nset down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they broach of\nmy father's wine. Nine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking\nit in turns to watch, and they kept a fire always burning, both in the\ncloister of the outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the\nroom wherein I lay; but when the darkness of the tenth night came, I\nbroke through the closed doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the\nouter court after passing quickly and unperceived through the men on\nguard and the women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came to\nfertile Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me\nwelcome and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir\nto all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,\nestablishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler over\nthe Dolopians.\n\n\"It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with all my\nheart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had gone out\nelsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut up the dainty\nmorsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup to your lips. Many a\ntime have you slobbered your wine in baby helplessness over my shirt; I\nhad infinite trouble with you, but I knew that heaven had vouchsafed me\nno offspring of my own, and I made a son of you, Achilles, that in my\nhour of need you might protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with\nyour pride and beat it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and\nmajesty of heaven are more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased;\nand if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them to\nhimself by his piteous cries and by frankincense, with drink-offerings\nand the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers are as daughters to\ngreat Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes askance, they follow in the\nfootsteps of sin, who, being fierce and fleet of foot, leaves them far\nbehind him, and ever baneful to mankind outstrips them even to the ends\nof the world; but nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing\nafter. If a man has pity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw\nnear him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but\nif he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to Jove the son of\nSaturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin--to his ruing\nbitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these daughters of Jove\ndue reverence, and bow before them as all good men will bow. Were not\nthe son of Atreus offering you gifts and promising others later--if he\nwere still furious and implacable--I am not he that would bid you throw\noff your anger and help the Achaeans, no matter how great their need;\nbut he is giving much now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains\nto urge his suit, and has chosen those who of all the Argives are most\nacceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to be of\nnone effect. Your anger has been righteous so far. We have heard in\nsong how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury,\nbut still they could be won by gifts, and fair words could soothe them.\n\n\"I have an old story in my mind--a very old one--but you are all\nfriends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were fighting\nand killing one another round Calydon--the Aetolians defending the city\nand the Curetes trying to destroy it. For Diana of the golden throne\nwas angry and did them hurt because Oeneus had not offered her his\nharvest first-fruits. The other gods had all been feasted with\nhecatombs, but to the daughter of great Jove alone he had made no\nsacrifice. He had forgotten her, or somehow or other it had escaped\nhim, and this was a grievous sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her\ndispleasure sent a prodigious creature against him--a savage wild boar\nwith great white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands,\nuprooting apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground.\nBut Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities and\nkilled it--for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed, and many\na man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the goddess set the\nCuretes and the Aetolians fighting furiously about the head and skin of\nthe boar.\n\n\"So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the\nCuretes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their ground\nunder the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager was angered as\neven a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed with his mother\nAlthaea, and therefore stayed at home with his wedded wife fair\nCleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter of Euenus, and of Ides\nthe man then living. He it was who took his bow and faced King Apollo\nhimself for fair Marpessa's sake; her father and mother then named her\nAlcyone, because her mother had mourned with the plaintive strains of\nthe halcyon-bird when Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager,\nthen, stayed at home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by\nreason of his mother's curses. His mother, grieving for the death of\nher brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands,\ncalling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down upon her\nknees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that they would\nkill her son--and Erinys that walks in darkness and knows no ruth heard\nher from Erebus.\n\n\"Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and the\ndull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the elders of\nthe Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest of their\npriests, and begged him to come out and help them, promising him a\ngreat reward. They bade him choose fifty plough-gates, the most fertile\nin the plain of Calydon, the one-half vineyard and the other open\nplough-land. The old warrior Oeneus implored him, standing at the\nthreshold of his room and beating the doors in supplication. His\nsisters and his mother herself besought him sore, but he the more\nrefused them; those of his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him\nalso prayed him, but they could not move him till the foe was battering\nat the very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls\nand were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing wife\ndetailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken; she\nreminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given over to the\nflames, while the women and children are carried into captivity; when\nhe heard all this, his heart was touched, and he donned his armour to\ngo forth. Thus of his own inward motion he saved the city of the\nAetolians; but they now gave him nothing of those rich rewards that\nthey had offered earlier, and though he saved the city he took nothing\nby it. Be not then, my son, thus minded; let not heaven lure you into\nany such course. When the ships are burning it will be a harder matter\nto save them. Take the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour\nyou as a god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat\nthe battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no need\nof such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will abide with\nme at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my limbs are strong.\nI say further--and lay my saying to your heart--vex me no more with\nthis weeping and lamentation, all in the cause of the son of Atreus.\nLove him so well, and you may lose the love I bear you. You ought to\nhelp me rather in troubling those that trouble me; be king as much as I\nam, and share like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer;\nstay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak we\nwill consider whether to remain or go.\"\n\nOn this he nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to prepare\na bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their leave. Ajax\nson of Telamon then said, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, let us be\ngone, for I see that our journey is vain. We must now take our answer,\nunwelcome though it be, to the Danaans who are waiting to receive it.\nAchilles is savage and remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing for\nthe love his comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others. He\nis implacable--and yet if a man's brother or son has been slain he will\naccept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and the\nwrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own people;\nbut as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked unforgiving spirit\nin your heart, and this, all about one single girl, whereas we now\noffer you the seven best we have, and much else into the bargain. Be\nthen of a more gracious mind, respect the hospitality of your own roof.\nWe are with you as messengers from the host of the Danaans, and would\nfain he held nearest and dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.\"\n\n\"Ajax,\" replied Achilles, \"noble son of Telamon, you have spoken much\nto my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over, and remember\nhow the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as though I were some\nvile tramp, and that too in the presence of the Argives. Go, then, and\ndeliver your message; say that I will have no concern with fighting\ntill Hector, son of noble Priam, reaches the tents of the Myrmidons in\nhis murderous course, and flings fire upon their ships. For all his\nlust of battle, I take it he will be held in check when he is at my own\ntent and ship.\"\n\nOn this they took every man his double cup, made their drink-offerings,\nand went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the way. But Patroclus told\nhis men and the maid-servants to make ready a comfortable bed for\nPhoenix; they therefore did so with sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of\nfine linen. The old man then laid himself down and waited till morning\ncame. But Achilles slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter\nof Phorbas lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from Lesbos.\nPatroclus lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair Iphis\nwhom Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.\n\nWhen the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the Achaeans\nrose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to question them. King\nAgamemnon was the first to do so. \"Tell me, Ulysses,\" said he, \"will he\nsave the ships from burning, or did he refuse, and is he still furious?\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,\nAchilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely angry than ever, and\nspurns both you and your gifts. He bids you take counsel with the\nAchaeans to save the ships and host as you best may; as for himself, he\nsaid that at daybreak he should draw his ships into the water. He said\nfurther that he should advise every one to sail home likewise, for that\nyou will not reach the goal of Ilius. 'Jove,' he said, 'has laid his\nhand over the city to protect it, and the people have taken heart.'\nThis is what he said, and the others who were with me can tell you the\nsame story--Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may be\ntrusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for so\nAchilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the morning\nif he so would; but he will not take him by force.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and dejected,\nby reason of the sternness with which Achilles had refused them, till\npresently Diomed said, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,\nAgamemnon, you ought not to have sued the son of Peleus nor offered him\ngifts. He is proud enough as it is, and you have encouraged him in his\npride still further. Let him stay or go as he will. He will fight later\nwhen he is in the humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now,\ntherefore, let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill,\nlet us then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and stay.\nBut when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out your host\nand your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them on, and yourself\nfighting among the foremost.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They then\nmade their drink-offerings and went every man to his own tent, where\nthey laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep.\n\n\n\nBOOK X\n\n  Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives\n  them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what\n  he had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take\n  his horses.\n\nNOW the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole night\nthrough, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that he could get\nno rest. As when fair Juno's lord flashes his lightning in token of\ngreat rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or\nagain as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so\ndid Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within\nhim. When he looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many\nwatchfires burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and\nflutes and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the\nships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls before\nJove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness of his soul.\nIn the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and\nsee if between them they could find any way of the Achaeans from\ndestruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt, bound his sandals\nabout his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion over his\nshoulders--a skin that reached his feet--and took his spear in his hand.\n\nNeither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the Argives\nwho for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight the\nTrojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther,\nput a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny\nhand. Then he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most\npowerful of the Achaeans, and was honoured by the people as though he\nwere a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his\ngoodly array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his\nbrother had come.\n\nMenelaus spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear brother, are you thus\narming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit the\nTrojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and spy\nupon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great\ndaring.\"\n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd\ncounsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his\nmind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. I\nnever saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one\nday as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans--and\nthat too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor\ngoddess. The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with\nall speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus.\nMeanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise and go about among the\ncompanies of our sentinels to give them their instructions; they will\nlisten to him sooner than to any man, for his own son, and Meriones\nbrother in arms to Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them\nmore particularly that we gave this charge.\"\n\nMenelaus replied, \"How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with them\nand wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I have given\nyour orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so many\npaths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on\nyour way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his\nfather's name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much\nupon your own dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our\nbirth Jove laid this heavy burden upon us.\"\n\nWith these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went on to\nNestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his tent hard\nby his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him--his shield, his two\nspears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming girdle with\nwhich the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people into\nbattle--for his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and\nlooked up at Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes thus about the\nhost and the ships alone and in the dead of night, when men are\nsleeping? Are you looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do\nnot stand there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\nname, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has laid labour\nand sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and my limbs carry me.\nI am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon my eyelids, but my heart\nis big with war and with the jeopardy of the Achaeans. I am in great\nfear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure counsel; my heart\nbeats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If\nthen you can do anything--for you too cannot sleep--let us go the round\nof the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to\nthe neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know not\nbut he may attack us by night.\"\n\nNestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, Jove\nwill not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he will; he will have\ntroubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I will go\nwith you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or\nUlysses, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had\nalso better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are\nnot near at hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from\nblaming Menelaus, much as I love him and respect him--and I will say so\nplainly, even at the risk of offending you--for sleeping and leaving\nall this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring aid\nfrom all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme danger.\"\n\nAnd Agamemnon answered, \"Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly, for\nhe is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself--not indeed from\nsloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and expects me\nto take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was awake before I was,\nand came to me of his own accord. I have already sent him to call the\nvery men whom you have named. And now let us be going. We shall find\nthem with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I said that we\nwould meet them.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives will not blame him nor\ndisobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them\ninstructions.\"\n\nWith this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his comely\nfeet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses, large, and of\na rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and\nwended his way along the line of the Achaean ships. First he called\nloudly to Ulysses peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he was soon\nroused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and\nsaid, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of\nthe ships in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so\nurgent?\" And Nestor knight of Gerene answered, \"Ulysses, noble son of\nLaertes, take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come\nwith me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether\nwe shall fight or fly.\"\n\nOn this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about his\nshoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed son of\nTydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour with his\ncomrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for\ntheir spears, they stood upright on the spikes of their butts that were\ndriven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like the\nlightning of father Jove. The hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox,\nwith a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and\nstirred him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him\nto bestir himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son of Tydeus. How can you\nsleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on\nthe brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a little space\nbetween us and them?\"\n\nOn these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, \"Old man, your\nheart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours. Are there\nno younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to rouse the\nprinces? There is no tiring you.\"\n\nAnd Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, \"My son, all that you have\nsaid is true. I have good sons, and also much people who might call the\nchieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and death\nare balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are\nyounger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of\nPhyleus.\"\n\nDiomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders--a skin\nthat reached his feet--and grasped his spear. When he had roused the\nheroes, he brought them back with him; they then went the round of\nthose who were on guard, and found the captains not sleeping at their\nposts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs\nthat watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast\ncoming through the mountain forest towards them--forthwith there is a\nhue and cry of dogs and men, and slumber is broken--even so was sleep\nchased from the eyes of the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the\nwicked night, for they turned constantly towards the plain whenever\nthey heard any stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad and bade\nthem be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said he, \"and let not\nsleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\"\n\nWith this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of the\nAchaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the brave son\nof Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they were beyond\nthe trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on the\nopen ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was here\nthat when night fell Hector had turned back from his onslaught on the\nArgives. They sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another.\n\nNestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is there any man bold\nenough to venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler, or\nbring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here\nby the ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted\nthe Achaeans, they will retire within their walls. If he could learn\nall this and come back safely here, his fame would be high as heaven in\nthe mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs\nfrom all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her\nlamb--which is a present of surpassing value--and he would be asked as\na guest to all feasts and clan-gatherings.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke saying,\n\"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over against us,\nbut if another will go with me I shall do so in greater confidence and\ncomfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some\nopportunity which the other has not caught sight of; if a man is alone\nhe is less full of resource, and his wit is weaker.\"\n\nOn this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes, servants of\nMars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaus\nson of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go among the host of the Trojans,\nfor he was ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke\nthus: \"Diomed,\" said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose\nyour comrade for yourself--take the best man of those that have\noffered, for many would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject\nthe better man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage,\nbecause he is of more royal blood.\"\n\nHe said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, \"If you\nbid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I fail to\nthink of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to face all\nkinds of danger--and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he were to go\nwith me we should pass safely through fire itself, for he is quick to\nsee and understand.\"\n\n\"Son of Tydeus,\" replied Ulysses, \"say neither good nor ill about me,\nfor you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going, for the\nnight wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone forward,\ntwo-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third is alone left\nus.\"\n\nThey then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son of\nTydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at his ship)\nand on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peak or\ncrest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones\nfound a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his head he set a leathern\nhelmet that was lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while\non the outside it was thickly studded with boar's teeth, well and\nskilfully set into it; next the head there was an inner lining of felt.\nThis helmet had been stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke\ninto the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of\nCythera to take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to\nMolus, who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the\nhead of Ulysses.\n\nWhen the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other chieftains\nbehind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the wayside upon their\nright hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but they heard its\ncry. Ulysses was glad when he heard it and prayed to Minerva: \"Hear\nme,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy out all my\nways and who are with me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine\nhour, and grant that we may return to the ships covered with glory\nafter having achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to\nthe Trojans.\"\n\nThen Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: \"Hear me too,\" said he,\n\"daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were with my\nnoble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent by the\nAchaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopus, and\nwent to the city bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeians; on his\nreturn thence, with your help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring,\nfor you were his ready helper. Even so guide me and guard me now, and\nin return I will offer you in sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year\nold, unbroken, and never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild\nher horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.\"\n\nThus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When they had\ndone praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went their way like\ntwo lions prowling by night amid the armour and blood-stained bodies of\nthem that had fallen.\n\nNeither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called the\nprinces and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his counsel\nbefore them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will do\nme the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid if he\nwill. I will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest\nthat can be found at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this\nthing; and he will win infinite honour to boot; he must go to the ships\nand find out whether they are still guarded as heretofore, or whether\nnow that we have beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through\nsheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.\"\n\nThey all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a certain\nman named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald--a man rich in gold\nand bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner, and was an only son\namong five sisters. He it was that now addressed the Trojans. \"I,\nHector,\" said he, \"Will to the ships and will exploit them. But first\nhold up your sceptre and swear that you will give me the chariot,\nbedight with bronze, and the horses that now carry the noble son of\nPeleus. I will make you a good scout, and will not fail you. I will go\nthrough the host from one end to the other till I come to the ship of\nAgamemnon, where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now\nconsulting whether they shall fight or fly.\"\n\nWhen he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore him his\noath saying, \"May Jove the thundering husband of Juno bear witness that\nno other Trojan but yourself shall mount those steeds, and that you\nshall have your will with them for ever.\"\n\nThe oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on going.\nHe hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he wore the skin\nof a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of ferret skin. Then he\ntook a pointed javelin, and left the camp for the ships, but he was not\nto return with any news for Hector. When he had left the horses and the\ntroops behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived\nhis coming and said to Diomed, \"Diomed, here is some one from the camp;\nI am not sure whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who\nwould plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we\ncan then spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too quick for\nus, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards the ships away\nfrom the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back to the town.\"\n\nWith this they turned out of their way and lay down among the corpses.\nDolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when he had got about\nas far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds one that\nhas been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than\noxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stood\nstill, for he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by\nHector's orders to bid him return; when, however, they were only a\nspear's cast, or less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran\nas fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once, and as\na couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe or hare that\nruns screaming in front of them, even so did the son of Tydeus and\nUlysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own people. But when he\nhad fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have fallen in\nwith the outposts, Minerva infused fresh strength into the son of\nTydeus for fear some other of the Achaeans might have the glory of\nbeing first to hit him, and he might himself be only second; he\ntherefore sprang forward with his spear and said, \"Stand, or I shall\nthrow my spear, and in that case I shall soon make an end of you.\"\n\nHe threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart flew over\nthe man's right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground. He stood stock\nstill, trembling and in great fear; his teeth chattered, and he turned\npale with fear. The two came breathless up to him and seized his hands,\nwhereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will ransom\nmyself; we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from\nthis my father will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he\nhear of my being alive at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" replied Ulysses, \"let no thought of death be in your mind;\nbut tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about alone in\nthe dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships, while\nother men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies of the slain, or\ndid Hector send you to spy out what was going on at the ships? Or did\nyou come here of your own mere notion?\"\n\nDolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: \"Hector, with his vain\nflattering promises, lured me from my better judgement. He said he\nwould give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus and his\nbronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the darkness of the\nflying night, get close to the enemy, and find out whether the ships\nare still guarded as heretofore, or whether, now that we have beaten\nthem, the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer exhaustion are\nneglecting to keep their watches.\"\n\nUlysses smiled at him and answered, \"You had indeed set your heart upon\na great reward, but the horses of the descendant of Aeacus are hardly\nto be kept in hand or driven by any other mortal man than Achilles\nhimself, whose mother was an immortal. But tell me, and tell me true,\nwhere did you leave Hector when you started? Where lies his armour and\nhis horses? How, too, are the watches and sleeping-ground of the\nTrojans ordered? What are their plans? Will they stay here by the ships\nand away from the city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\nwill they retire within their walls?\"\n\nAnd Dolon answered, \"I will tell you truly all. Hector and the other\ncouncillors are now holding conference by the monument of great Ilus,\naway from the general tumult; as for the guards about which you ask me,\nthere is no chosen watch to keep guard over the host. The Trojans have\ntheir watchfires, for they are bound to have them; they, therefore, are\nawake and keep each other to their duty as sentinels; but the allies\nwho have come from other places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans\nto keep guard, for their wives and children are not here.\"\n\nUlysses then said, \"Now tell me; are they sleeping among the Trojan\ntroops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may understand it.\"\n\n\"I will tell you truly all,\" replied Dolon. \"To the seaward lie the\nCarians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians, and the\nnoble Pelasgi. The Lysians and proud Mysians, with the Phrygians and\nMeonians, have their place on the side towards Thymbra; but why ask\nabout all this? If you want to find your way into the host of the\nTrojans, there are the Thracians, who have lately come here and lie\napart from the others at the far end of the camp; and they have Rhesus\nson of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and strongest\nthat I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any\nwind that blows. His chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he\nhas brought his marvellous golden armour, of the rarest\nworkmanship--too splendid for any mortal man to carry, and meet only\nfor the gods. Now, therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely\nhere, until you come back and have proved my words whether they be\nfalse or true.\"\n\nDiomed looked sternly at him and answered, \"Think not, Dolon, for all\nthe good information you have given us, that you shall escape now you\nare in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you will come\nsome second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as an\nopen enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more\ntrouble.\"\n\nOn this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him\nfurther, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his sword\nand cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the dust\nwhile he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head,\nand also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Ulysses hung them\nup aloft in honour of Minerva the goddess of plunder, and prayed\nsaying, \"Accept these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference\nto all the gods in Olympus: therefore speed us still further towards\nthe horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\"\n\nWith these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk tree,\nand they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of\ntamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the\nflying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen\narmour and the blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian\nsoldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; their\ngoodly armour was lying on the ground beside them all orderly in three\nrows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was\nsleeping in the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to\nthe topmost rim of his chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him and\nsaid, \"This, Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which\nDolon whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not about your\narmour, but loose the horses at once--or else kill the men yourself,\nwhile I see to the horses.\"\n\nThereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he smote them\nright and left. They made a hideous groaning as they were being hacked\nabout, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion springs\nfuriously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds them without\ntheir shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian soldiers\ntill he had killed twelve. As he killed them Ulysses came and drew them\naside by their feet one by one, that the horses might go forward freely\nwithout being frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they\nwere not yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he\nkilled him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by\nthe counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that\nnight over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the horses, made them\nfast one to another and drove them off, striking them with his bow, for\nhe had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then he whistled as\na sign to Diomed.\n\nBut Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed he\nmight accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot in which\nthe king's armour was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to lift\nthe armour out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill\nsome more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Minerva came up to\nhim and said, \"Get back, Diomed, to the ships or you may be driven\nthither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\"\n\nDiomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the\nhorses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to the\nships of the Achaeans.\n\nBut Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the son of\nTydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans he\nroused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of\nRhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were no\nlonger in their place, and that the men were gasping in their\ndeath-agony; on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by\nname. Then the whole Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept\nhurrying together, and they marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who\nhad now got away towards the ships.\n\nWhen they reached the place where they had killed Hector's scout,\nUlysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the\nground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses and\nremounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward\nnothing loth towards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor\nwas first to hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he,\n\"princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall I guess right or\nwrong?--but I must say what I think: there is a sound in my ears as of\nthe tramp of horses. I hope it may be Diomed and Ulysses driving in\nhorses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest of the\nArgives may have come to some harm at their hands.\"\n\nHe had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and dismounted,\nwhereon the others shook hands right gladly with them and congratulated\nthem. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to question them. \"Tell me,\"\nsaid he, \"renowned Ulysses, how did you two come by these horses? Did\nyou steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give\nthem to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the\nTrojans, for old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships,\nbut I never yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some\ngod must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you\ndear to Jove, and to Jove's daughter Minerva.\"\n\nAnd Ulysses answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean\nname, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better horses than these,\nfor the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses, however, about\nwhich you ask me, are freshly come from Thrace. Diomed killed their\nking with the twelve bravest of his companions. Hard by the ships we\ntook a thirteenth man--a scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had\nsent as a spy upon our ships.\"\n\nHe laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while the\nother Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the strongly\nbuilt quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with thongs\nof leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomed stood eating their\nsweet corn, but Ulysses hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the\nstern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to\nMinerva. As for themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat\nfrom their bodies, and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water\nhad taken all the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they\nwent into the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and\nhad anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing\nfrom a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to Minerva.\n\n\n\nBOOK XI\n\n  In the forenoon the fight is equal, but Agamemnon turns the\n  fortune of the day towards the Achaeans until he gets\n  wounded and leaves the field--Hector then drives everything\n  before him till he is wounded by Diomed--Paris wounds\n  Diomed--Ulysses, Nestor, and Idomeneus perform prodigies\n  of valour--Machaon is wounded--Nestor drives him off in\n  his chariot--Achilles sees the pair driving towards the camp\n  and sends Patroclus to ask who it is that is wounded--This\n  is the beginning of evil for Patroclus--Nestor makes a long\n  speech.\n\nAND now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of light\nalike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord with the\nensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans. She took her\nstand by the huge black hull of Ulysses' ship which was middlemost of\nall, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on the one\nhand towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards\nthose of Achilles--for these two heroes, well-assured of their own\nstrength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the\nline. There she took her stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill\nthat filled the Achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight\nresolutely and with all their might, so that they had rather stay there\nand do battle than go home in their ships.\n\nThe son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird themselves\nfor battle while he put on his armour. First he girded his goodly\ngreaves about his legs, making them fast with ankle-clasps of silver;\nand about his chest he set the breastplate which Cinyras had once given\nhim as a guest-gift. It had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus that\nthe Achaeans were about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to\nthe king. It had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten of\ntin. There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards\nthe neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son of\nSaturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About his shoulders\nhe threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and the scabbard was\nof silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang it. He took moreover\nthe richly-dight shield that covered his body when he was in\nbattle--fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running all round it.\nOn the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, with\nanother of dark cyanus in the middle: this last was made to show a\nGorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The\nband for the arm to go through was of silver, on which there was a\nwrithing snake of cyanus with three heads that sprang from a single\nneck, and went in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set\na helmet, with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair\nthat nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable\nbronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as a\nflame into the firmament, while Juno and Minerva thundered in honour of\nthe king of rich Mycene.\n\nEvery man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold them\nin readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad in\nfull armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into the dawning. The\nchiefs were armed and at the trench before the horses got there, but\nthese came up presently. The son of Saturn sent a portent of evil sound\nabout their host, and the dew fell red with blood, for he was about to\nsend many a brave man hurrying down to Hades.\n\nThe Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the plain, were\ngathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas who was honoured\nby the Trojans like an immortal, and the three sons of Antenor,\nPolybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a god. Hector's round\nshield showed in the front rank, and as some baneful star that shines\nfor a moment through a rent in the clouds and is again hidden beneath\nthem; even so was Hector now seen in the front ranks and now again in\nthe hindermost, and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of\naegis-bearing Jove.\n\nAnd now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon a rich\nman's land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even so did the\nTrojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were in no mood for\nyielding but fought like wolves, and neither side got the better of the\nother. Discord was glad as she beheld them, for she was the only god\nthat went among them; the others were not there, but stayed quietly\neach in his own home among the dells and valleys of Olympus. All of\nthem blamed the son of Saturn for wanting to give victory to the\nTrojans, but father Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and\nsat apart in his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of\nthe Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and alike\nupon the slayers and on the slain.\n\nNow so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their darts\nrained thick on one another and the people perished, but as the hour\ndrew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest will get his\nmidday meal--for he has felled till his hands are weary; he is tired\nout, and must now have food--then the Danaans with a cry that rang\nthrough all their ranks, broke the battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon\nled them on, and slew first Bienor, a leader of his people, and\nafterwards his comrade and charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his\nchariot and was coming full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on\nthe forehead with his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against\nthe weapon, which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were\nbattered in and he was killed in full fight.\n\nAgamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with their\nbreasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went on to kill\nIsus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a bastard, the other born\nin wedlock; they were in the same chariot--the bastard driving, while\nnoble Antiphus fought beside him. Achilles had once taken both of them\nprisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as\nthey were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now,\nhowever, Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the\nnipple with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and\nthrew him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly armour\nfrom off them and recognized them, for he had already seen them at\nships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion fastens on the\nfawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them of\ntheir tender life while he on his way back to his lair--the hind can do\nnothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an agony of\nfear, and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost\nspeed before the mighty monster--so, no man of the Trojans could help\nIsus and Antiphus, for they were themselves flying in panic before the\nArgives.\n\nThen King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and brave\nHippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in preventing\nHelen's being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely bribed by\nAlexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both in the same\nchariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand--for they had lost\nhold of the reins and the horses were mad with fear. The son of Atreus\nsprang upon them like a lion, and the pair besought him from their\nchariot. \"Take us alive,\" they cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall\nreceive a great ransom for us. Our father Antimachus has great store of\ngold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with\na very large ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of\nthe Achaeans.\"\n\nWith such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but they\nheard no pitiful answer in return. \"If,\" said Agamemnon, \"you are sons\nof Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans proposed that Menelaus\nand Ulysses, who had come to you as envoys, should be killed and not\nsuffered to return, you shall now pay for the foul iniquity of your\nfather.\"\n\nAs he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth, smiting\nhim on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face uppermost upon the\nground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did Agamemnon smite; he cut off\nhis hands and his head--which he sent rolling in among the crowd as\nthough it were a ball. There he let them both lie, and wherever the\nranks were thickest thither he flew, while the other Achaeans followed.\nFoot soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them,\nand slew them; horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering\ntramp of the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. King\nAgamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on the\nAchaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze--the eddying gusts\nwhirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and are consumed\nbefore the blast of the flame--even so fell the heads of the flying\nTrojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a noble pair of steeds\ndrew an empty chariot along the highways of war, for lack of drivers\nwho were lying on the plain, more useful now to vultures than to their\nwives.\n\nJove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage and din\nof battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling out lustily to\nthe Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus, son of Dardanus, in\nthe middle of the plain, and past the place of the wild fig-tree making\nalways for the city--the son of Atreus still shouting, and with hands\nall bedrabbled in gore; but when they had reached the Scaean gates and\nthe oak tree, there they halted and waited for the others to come up.\nMeanwhile the Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like\na herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in\nthe dead of night--he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the\ngrip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges himself\nupon her entrails--even so did King Agamemnon son of Atreus pursue the\nfoe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they fled pell-mell before him.\nMany a man was flung headlong from his chariot by the hand of the son\nof Atreus, for he wielded his spear with fury.\n\nBut when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city, the\nfather of gods and men came down from heaven and took his seat,\nthunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida. He then\ntold Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him. \"Go,\" said\nhe, \"fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector--say that so long as he sees\nAgamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks, he is\nto keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle, but when\nAgamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his\nchariot, then will I vouchsafe him strength to slay till he reach the\nships and night falls at the going down of the sun.\"\n\nIris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the\ncrests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his chariot\nand horses. Then she said, \"Hector son of Priam, peer of gods in\ncounsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this message--so long as\nyou see Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the Trojan ranks,\nyou are to keep aloof and bid the others bear the brunt of the battle,\nbut when Agamemnon is wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to\nhis chariot, then will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you\nreach the ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.\"\n\nWhen she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full armed\nfrom his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he went about\neverywhere among the host, cheering his men on to fight, and stirring\nthe dread strife of battle. The Trojans then wheeled round, and again\nmet the Achaeans, while the Argives on their part strengthened their\nbattalions. The battle was now in array and they stood face to face\nwith one another, Agamemnon ever pressing forward in his eagerness to\nbe ahead of all others.\n\nTell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,\nwhether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face Agamemnon?\nIt was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and of great stature,\nwho was brought up in fertile Thrace, the mother of sheep. Cisses, his\nmother's father, brought him up in his own house when he was a\nchild--Cisses, father to fair Theano. When he reached manhood, Cisses\nwould have kept him there, and was for giving him his daughter in\nmarriage, but as soon as he had married he set out to fight the\nAchaeans with twelve ships that followed him: these he had left at\nPercote and had come on by land to Ilius. He it was that now met\nAgamemnon son of Atreus. When they were close up with one another, the\nson of Atreus missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below\nthe cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength\nof arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for the\npoint of the spear struck against the silver and was turned aside as\nthough it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from his hand, and\ndrew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he then drew his sword,\nand killed Iphidamas by striking him on the neck. So there the poor\nfellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were of bronze, killed in the\ndefence of his fellow-citizens, far from his wedded wife, of whom he\nhad had no joy though he had given much for her: he had given a\nhundred-head of cattle down, and had promised later on to give a\nthousand sheep and goats mixed, from the countless flocks of which he\nwas possessed. Agamemnon son of Atreus then despoiled him, and carried\noff his armour into the host of the Achaeans.\n\nWhen noble Coon, Antenor's eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were his\neyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon he got\nbeside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle of his arm\nbelow the elbow, the point of the spear going right through the arm.\nAgamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not even for this did he\nleave off struggling and fighting, but grasped his spear that flew as\nfleet as the wind, and sprang upon Coon who was trying to drag off the\nbody of his brother--his father's son--by the foot, and was crying for\nhelp to all the bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with\na bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead body\nthrough the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut off his\nhead, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus did the sons of Antenor\nmeet their fate at the hands of the son of Atreus, and go down into the\nhouse of Hades.\n\nAs long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon went\nabout attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword and with\ngreat handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased to flow and the\nwound grew dry, the pain became great. As the sharp pangs which the\nEilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth, daughters of Juno and dispensers\nof cruel pain, send upon a woman when she is in labour--even so sharp\nwere the pangs of the son of Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and\nbade his charioteer drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. With\na loud clear voice he shouted to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and\ncounsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove has\nnot suffered me to fight the whole day through against the Trojans.\"\n\nWith this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and they\nflew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam and their\nbellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of the battle.\n\nWhen Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the Trojans and\nLycians saying, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian warriors, be men, my\nfriends, and acquit yourselves in battle bravely; their best man has\nleft them, and Jove has vouchsafed me a great triumph; charge the foe\nwith your chariots that you may win still greater glory.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a huntsman\nhounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so did Hector,\npeer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the Achaeans. Full of\nhope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell on the fight like some\nfierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea, and lashes its deep blue\nwaters into fury.\n\nWhat, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam killed in\nthe hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him? First Asaeus,\nAutonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius, Opheltius and Agelaus;\nAesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in battle; these chieftains of\nthe Achaeans did Hector slay, and then he fell upon the rank and file.\nAs when the west wind hustles the clouds of the white south and beats\nthem down with the fierceness of its fury--the waves of the sea roll\nhigh, and the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering\nwind--even so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of\nHector.\n\nAll had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would have\nfled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to Diomed,\n\"Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus forget our\nprowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and help me, we shall\nbe shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.\"\n\nAnd Diomed answered, \"Come what may, I will stand firm; but we shall\nhave scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to the Trojans\nrather than to us.\"\n\nWith these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the ground,\nsmiting him in the left breast with his spear, while Ulysses killed\nMolion who was his squire. These they let lie, now that they had\nstopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on playing havoc with\nthe foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury and rend the hounds that\nhunt them. Thus did they turn upon the Trojans and slay them, and the\nAchaeans were thankful to have breathing time in their flight from\nHector.\n\nThey then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of Merops\nof Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of divination. He had\nforbidden his sons to go to the war, but they would not obey him, for\nfate lured them to their fall. Diomed son of Tydeus slew them both and\nstripped them of their armour, while Ulysses killed Hippodamus and\nHypeirochus.\n\nAnd now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained that\nneither side should have the advantage, and they kept on killing one\nanother. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of Paeon in the\nhip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at hand for him to fly\nwith, so blindly confident had he been. His squire was in charge of it\nat some distance and he was fighting on foot among the foremost until\nhe lost his life. Hector soon marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were\nmaking, and bore down upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan\nranks; brave Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses\nwho was beside him, \"Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall\nbe undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss his\nmark. He had aimed at Hector's head near the top of his helmet, but\nbronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was untouched, for the spear\nwas stayed by the visored helm made with three plates of metal, which\nPhoebus Apollo had given him. Hector sprang back with a great bound\nunder cover of the ranks; he fell on his knees and propped himself with\nhis brawny hand leaning on the ground, for darkness had fallen on his\neyes. The son of Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the\nforemost fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;\nmeanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into his chariot\nmingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life. But Diomed\nmade at him with his spear and said, \"Dog, you have again got away\nthough death was close on your heels. Phoebus Apollo, to whom I ween\nyou pray ere you go into battle, has again saved you, nevertheless I\nwill meet you and make an end of you hereafter, if there is any god who\nwill stand by me too and be my helper. For the present I must pursue\nthose I can lay hands on.\"\n\nAs he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon, but\nAlexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him, leaning\nagainst a pillar of the monument which men had raised to Ilus son of\nDardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken the cuirass from off\nthe breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet also, and the shield from\noff his shoulders, when Paris drew his bow and let fly an arrow that\nsped not from his hand in vain, but pierced the flat of Diomed's right\nfoot, going right through it and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon\nParis with a hearty laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and\ntaunted him saying, \"You are wounded--my arrow has not been shot in\nvain; would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus\nthe Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a truce\nfrom evil.\"\n\nDiomed all undaunted answered, \"Archer, you who without your bow are\nnothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single\ncombat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows would serve\nyou in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you have scratched the\nsole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had\nhit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound; when I wound\na man though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon\nwill lay him low. His wife will tear her cheeks for grief and his\nchildren will be fatherless: there will he rot, reddening the earth\nwith his blood, and vultures, not women, will gather round him.\"\n\nThus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this cover\nhe sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was the pain he\nsuffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his chariot and bade the\ncharioteer drive him to the ships, for he was sick at heart.\n\nUlysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for they\nwere all panic-stricken. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay,\n\"what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly before these odds,\nbut it will be worse if I am left alone and taken prisoner, for the son\nof Saturn has struck the rest of the Danaans with panic. But why talk\nto myself in this way? Well do I know that though cowards quit the\nfield, a hero, whether he wound or be wounded, must stand firm and hold\nhis own.\"\n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced and\nhemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it. As hounds and\nlusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from his lair whetting\nhis white tusks--they attack him from every side and can hear the\ngnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness they still hold their\nground--even so furiously did the Trojans attack Ulysses. First he\nsprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder\nwith a downward blow; then he killed Thoon and Ennomus. After these he\nstruck Chersidamas in the loins under his shield as he had just sprung\ndown from his chariot; so he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in\nthe hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound Charops\nson of Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus, hero that he was,\nmade all speed to help him, and when he was close to Ulysses he said,\n\"Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day you shall\neither boast of having killed both the sons of Hippasus and stripped\nthem of their armour, or you shall fall before my spear.\"\n\nWith these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went\nthrough the shield and passed on through his richly wrought cuirass,\ntearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did not suffer it\nto pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew that his hour was not\nyet come, but he gave ground and said to Socus, \"Wretch, you shall now\nsurely die. You have stayed me from fighting further with the Trojans,\nbut you shall now fall by my spear, yielding glory to myself, and your\nsoul to Hades of the noble steeds.\"\n\nSocus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck him in\nthe back midway between the shoulders, and went right through his\nchest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses vaunted over him\nsaying, \"O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, death has been too\nquick for you and you have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even in\ndeath shall your father and mother close your eyes, but the ravening\nvultures shall enshroud you with the flapping of their dark wings and\ndevour you. Whereas even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due\nrites of burial.\"\n\nSo saying he drew Socus's heavy spear out of his flesh and from his\nshield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was withdrawn so that\nhe was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Ulysses was bleeding\nthey raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he\ntherefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him.\nThrice did he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave\nMenelaus hear him; he turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside\nhim and said, \"Ajax, noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the\ncry of Ulysses rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off\nand were worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way\nthrough the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he may\ncome to harm for all his valour if he be left without support, and the\nDanaans would miss him sorely.\"\n\nHe led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had gathered\nround Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the carcase of some\nhorned stag that has been hit with an arrow--the stag has fled at full\nspeed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted, but\nwhen the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him in the\nshady glades of the forest. Then heaven sends a fierce lion thither,\nwhereon the jackals fly in terror and the lion robs them of their\nprey--even so did Trojans many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses,\nbut the hero stood at bay and kept them off with his spear. Ajax then\ncame up with his shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by,\nwhereon the Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by\nthe hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up his\nchariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed Doryclus,\na bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus, Lysandrus, Pyrasus,\nand Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes rushing in full flood from\nthe mountains on to the plain, big with the rain of heaven--many a dry\noak and many a pine does it engulf, and much mud does it bring down and\ncast into the sea--even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over\nthe plain, slaying both men and horses.\n\nHector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting on the\nextreme left of the battle by the banks of the river Scamander, where\nthe carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest round Nestor and brave\nIdomeneus. Among these Hector was making great slaughter with his spear\nand furious driving, and was destroying the ranks that were opposed to\nhim; still the Achaeans would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus\nhusband of lovely Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon, shepherd of his\npeople, by wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed\narrow. The Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned\nagainst them the Trojans might take him prisoner, and Idomeneus said to\nNestor, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean name, mount your\nchariot at once; take Machaon with you and drive your horses to the\nships as fast as you can. A physician is worth more than several other\nmen put together, for he can cut out arrows and spread healing herbs.\"\n\nNestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at once\nmounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician\nAesculapius, went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew onward\nnothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own free will.\n\nThen Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector from his\nplace beside him, \"Hector, here are we two fighting on the extreme wing\nof the battle, while the other Trojans are in pell-mell rout, they and\ntheir horses. Ajax son of Telamon is driving them before him; I know\nhim by the breadth of his shield: let us turn our chariot and horses\nthither, where horse and foot are fighting most desperately, and where\nthe cry of battle is loudest.\"\n\nWith this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the whip they\ndrew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and Trojans, over the\nbodies and shields of those that had fallen: the axle was bespattered\nwith blood, and the rail round the car was covered with splashes both\nfrom the horses' hoofs and from the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore\nhis way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his\npresence threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long\nidle; nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,\nand throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Jove\nwould have been angry with him if he had fought a better man than\nhimself.\n\nThen father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart of\nAjax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind\nhim--looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\nwild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly\nbackwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from their\nstockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of\ntheir herd--he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from\nmany a strong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that\nscare him for all his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and\nangry away--even so did Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily\nbefore the Trojans, fearing for the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some\nlazy ass that has had many a cudgel broken about his back, when he into\na field begins eating the corn--boys beat him but he is too many for\nthem, and though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;\nstill when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the\nfield--even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax, ever\nsmiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and again he\nwould turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions of the Trojans,\nand then he would again retreat; but he prevented any of them from\nmaking his way to the ships. Single-handed he stood midway between the\nTrojans and Achaeans: the spears that sped from their hands stuck some\nof them in his mighty shield, while many, though thirsting for his\nblood, fell to the ground ere they could reach him to the wounding of\nhis fair flesh.\n\nNow when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was being\noverpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and hurled his\nspear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver below the\nmidriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him, and stripped the\narmour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus saw him, he aimed an\narrow at him which struck him in the right thigh; the arrow broke, but\nthe point that was left in the wound dragged on the thigh; he drew\nback, therefore, under cover of his comrades to save his life, shouting\nas he did so to the Danaans, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of\nthe Argives, rally to the defence of Ajax who is being overpowered, and\nI doubt whether he will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then, to\nthe rescue of great Ajax son of Telamon.\"\n\nEven so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came near,\nand gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from their\nshoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards them, and\nturned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached his men.\n\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the mares\nof Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor out of the\nfight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people. Achilles saw and\ntook note, for he was standing on the stern of his ship watching the\nhard stress and struggle of the fight. He called from the ship to his\ncomrade Patroclus, who heard him in the tent and came out looking like\nMars himself--here indeed was the beginning of the ill that presently\nbefell him. \"Why,\" said he, \"Achilles, do you call me? What do you want\nwith me?\" And Achilles answered, \"Noble son of Menoetius, man after my\nown heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my\nknees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask Nestor who\nit is that he is bearing away wounded from the field; from his back I\nshould say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but I could not see his\nface for the horses went by me at full speed.\"\n\nPatroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off running\nby the ships and tents of the Achaeans.\n\nWhen Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of Neleus,\nthey dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the horses from the\nchariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the seaside to dry the\nsweat from their shirts, and when they had so done they came inside and\ntook their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom Nestor had had awarded to him\nfrom Tenedos when Achilles took it, mixed them a mess; she was daughter\nof wise Arsinous, and the Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he\nexcelled all of them in counsel. First she set for them a fair and\nwell-made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of\nbronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes\nof barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the old\nman had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of gold; it had\nfour handles, on each of which there were two golden doves feeding, and\nit had two feet to stand on. Any one else would hardly have been able\nto lift it from the table when it was full, but Nestor could do so\nquite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed them a\nmess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat's milk cheese into it with a\nbronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus\nprepared the mess she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had\nthus quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at\nthis moment Patroclus appeared at the door.\n\nWhen the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his hand, led\nhim into the tent, and bade him take his place among them; but\nPatroclus stood where he was and said, \"Noble sir, I may not stay, you\ncannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me is not one to be trifled\nwith, and he bade me ask who the wounded man was whom you were bearing\naway from the field. I can now see for myself that he is Machaon,\nshepherd of his people. I must go back and tell Achilles. You, sir,\nknow what a terrible man he is, and how ready to blame even where no\nblame should lie.\"\n\nAnd Nestor answered, \"Why should Achilles care to know how many of the\nAchaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that reigns in our\nhost; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled, brave Diomed, son of\nTydeus, is wounded; so are Ulysses and Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been\nhit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man\nfrom the field--he too wounded with an arrow. Nevertheless, Achilles,\nso valiant though he be, cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till\nthe ships, do what we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the\nother? As for me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would\nthat I were still young and strong as in the days when there was a\nfight between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then\nkilled Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, a dweller in Elis, as\nI was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown by my hand\nwhile fighting in the front rank in defence of his cows, so he fell and\nthe country people around him were in great fear. We drove off a vast\nquantity of booty from the plain, fifty herds of cattle and as many\nflocks of sheep; fifty droves also of pigs, and as many wide-spreading\nflocks of goats. Of horses, moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty,\nall of them mares, and many had foals running with them. All these did\nwe drive by night to Pylus, the city of Neleus, taking them within the\ncity; and the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much,\nthough it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak\nthe heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom there was a debt\nowing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to divide the\nspoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed chattels, for we men of\nPylus were few and had been oppressed with wrong; in former years\nHercules had come, and had laid his hand heavy upon us, so that all our\nbest men had perished. Neleus had had twelve sons, but I alone was\nleft; the others had all been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all\nthis had looked down upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose\na herd of cattle and a great flock of sheep--three hundred in all--and\nhe took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to him\nin Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and their chariots\nwith them had gone to the games and were to run for a tripod, but King\nAugeas took them, and sent back their driver grieving for the loss of\nhis horses. Neleus was angered by what he had both said and done, and\ntook great value in return, but he divided the rest, that no man might\nhave less than his full share.\n\n\"Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods\nthroughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in a\nbody, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array, and with\nthem the two Moliones in their armour, though they were still lads and\nunused to fighting. Now there is a certain town, Thryoessa, perched\nupon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border city of Pylus. This they\nwould destroy, and pitched their camp about it, but when they had\ncrossed their whole plain, Minerva darted down by night from Olympus\nand bade us set ourselves in array; and she found willing soldiers in\nPylos, for the men meant fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid\nmy horses, for he said that as yet I could know nothing about war;\nnevertheless Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I\nfought among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.\nThere is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and there\nthey that were mounted (and I with them) waited till morning, when the\ncompanies of foot soldiers came up with us in force. Thence in full\npanoply and equipment we came towards noon to the sacred waters of the\nAlpheus, and there we offered victims to almighty Jove, with a bull to\nAlpheus, another to Neptune, and a herd-heifer to Minerva. After this\nwe took supper in our companies, and laid us down to rest each in his\narmour by the river.\n\n\"The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to take it,\nbut ere this might be there was a desperate fight in store for them.\nWhen the sun's rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle,\npraying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the fight had begun, I was the\nfirst to kill my man and take his horses--to wit the warrior Mulius. He\nwas son-in-law to Augeas, having married his eldest daughter,\ngolden-haired Agamede, who knew the virtues of every herb which grows\nupon the face of the earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me,\nand when he fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and\ntook my place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions\nwhen they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)\nlaid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty\nchariots--and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my spear.\nI should have even killed the two Moliones, sons of Actor, unless their\nreal father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had hidden them in a thick\nmist and borne them out of the fight. Thereon Jove vouchsafed the\nPylians a great victory, for we chased them far over the plain, killing\nthe men and bringing in their armour, till we had brought our horses to\nBuprasium, rich in wheat, and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that\nis called Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back. There\nI slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their horses\nback from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among the gods,\nand among mortal men to Nestor.\n\n\"Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles is for\nkeeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue it hereafter\nwhen the host is being cut to pieces. My good friend, did not Menoetius\ncharge you thus, on the day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon?\nUlysses and I were in the house, inside, and heard all that he said to\nyou; for we came to the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits\nthroughout all Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and\nyourself, and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer\ncourt, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord of\nthunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he poured\ndrink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You two were busy\ncutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood at the gates,\nwhereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the hand into the house,\nplaced us at table, and set before us such hospitable entertainment as\nguests expect. When we had satisfied ourselves with meat and drink, I\nsaid my say and urged both of you to join us. You were ready enough to\ndo so, and the two old men charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus\nbade his son Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his\npeers, while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: 'My son,'\nsaid he, 'Achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are older\nthan he, though he is far the better man of the two. Counsel him\nwisely, guide him in the right way, and he will follow you to his own\nprofit.' Thus did your father charge you, but you have forgotten;\nnevertheless, even now, say all this to Achilles if he will listen to\nyou. Who knows but with heaven's help you may talk him over, for it is\ngood to take a friend's advice. If, however, he is fearful about some\noracle, or if his mother has told him something from Jove, then let him\nsend you, and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if\nperchance you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him\nsend you into battle clad in his own armour, that the Trojans may\nmistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the Achaeans\nmay thus have time to get their breath, for they are hard pressed and\nthere is little breathing time in battle. You, who are fresh, might\neasily drive a tired enemy back to his walls and away from the tents\nand ships.\"\n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off running\nby the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of Aeacus. When he had\ngot as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was their place of assembly\nand court of justice, with their altars dedicated to the gods,\nEurypylus son of Euaemon, met him, wounded in the thigh with an arrow,\nand limping out of the fight. Sweat rained from his head and shoulders,\nand black blood welled from his cruel wound, but his mind did not\nwander. The son of Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him\nand spoke piteously saying, \"O unhappy princes and counsellors of the\nDanaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your fat,\nfar from your friends and your native land? Say, noble Eurypylus, will\nthe Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in check, or will they fall\nnow before his spear?\"\n\nWounded Eurypylus made answer, \"Noble Patroclus, there is no hope left\nfor the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All they that\nwere princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of\nthe Trojans, who are waxing stronger and stronger. But save me and take\nme to your ship; cut out the arrow from my thigh; wash the black blood\nfrom off it with warm water, and lay upon it those gracious herbs\nwhich, so they say, have been shown you by Achilles, who was himself\nshown them by Chiron, most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the\nphysicians Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded\nin his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other is\nfighting the Trojans upon the plain.\"\n\n\"Hero Eurypylus,\" replied the brave son of Menoetius, \"how may these\nthings be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message to noble\nAchilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans, but even so I\nwill not be unmindful of your distress.\"\n\nWith this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the tent,\nand a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the ground for\nhim to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out the sharp arrow\nfrom his thigh; he washed the black blood from the wound with warm\nwater; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing it between his hands, and\nspread it upon the wound; this was a virtuous herb which killed all\npain; so the wound presently dried and the blood left off flowing.\n\n\n\nBOOK XII\n\n  The Trojans and their allies break the wall, led on by Hector.\n\nSO THE son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus within\nthe tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought desperately, nor\nwere the trench and the high wall above it, to keep the Trojans in\ncheck longer. They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug the\ntrench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and the rich\nspoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the\ngods. It had been built without the consent of the immortals, and\ntherefore it did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles nursed\nhis anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken, the great\nwall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of the Trojans\nwere no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were yet left\nalive--when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth year, and the\nArgives had gone back with their ships to their own country--then\nNeptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy the wall, and they turned on\nto it the streams of all the rivers from Mount Ida into the sea,\nRhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus, and goodly\nScamander, with Simois, where many a shield and helm had fallen, and\nmany a hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo\nturned the mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for\nnine days against the wall, while Jove rained the whole time that he\nmight wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself, trident in hand,\nsurveyed the work and threw into the sea all the foundations of beams\nand stones which the Achaeans had laid with so much toil; he made all\nlevel by the mighty stream of the Hellespont, and then when he had\nswept the wall away he spread a great beach of sand over the place\nwhere it had been. This done he turned the rivers back into their old\ncourses.\n\nThis was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as yet\nbattle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its timbers\nrang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by the\nscourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hector the\nmighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force and\nfury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogs\nand men that attack him, while these form a solid wall and shower their\njavelins as they face him--his courage is all undaunted, but his high\nspirit will be the death of him; many a time does he charge at his\npursuers to scatter them, and they fall back as often as he does\nso--even so did Hector go about among the host exhorting his men, and\ncheering them on to cross the trench.\n\nBut the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its brink, for\nthe width frightened them. They could neither jump it nor cross it, for\nit had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above which there\nwere the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had planted so\nclose and strong as a defence against all who would assail it; a horse,\ntherefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, but\nthose who were on foot kept trying their very utmost. Then Polydamas\nwent up to Hector and said, \"Hector, and you other captains of the\nTrojans and allies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horses\nacross the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full of\nsharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall. Our horses therefore\ncannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they did; moreover\nit is a narrow place and we should come to harm. If, indeed, great Jove\nis minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger will utterly destroy\nthe Achaeans, I would myself gladly see them perish now and here far\nfrom Argos; but if they should rally and we are driven back from the\nships pell-mell into the trench there will be not so much as a man get\nback to the city to tell the tale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I\nsay; let our squires hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow\nHector in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of their\ndoom is at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us.\"\n\nThus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in full\narmour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they saw him do\nso, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses over to his\ncharioteer in charge to hold them ready for him at the trench. Then\nthey formed themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and in\nfive bodies followed their leaders. Those that went with Hector and\nPolydamas were the bravest and most in number, and the most determined\nto break through the wall and fight at the ships. Cebriones was also\njoined with them as third in command, for Hector had left his chariot\nin charge of a less valiant soldier. The next company was led by Paris,\nAlcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and Deiphobus, two sons of\nPriam, and with them was the hero Asius--Asius, the son of Hyrtacus,\nwhose great black horses of the breed that comes from the river Selleis\nhad brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas, the valiant son of Anchises, led\nthe fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men\nwell versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon was captain over the\nallies, and took with him Glaucus and Asteropaeus whom he deemed most\nvaliant after himself--for he was far the best man of them all. These\nhelped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged\nstraight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they would not hold\nout longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the ships.\n\nThe rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel of\nPolydamas but Asius, son of Hyrtacus, would not leave his horses and\nhis esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took them on with him\ntowards the ships, nor did he fail to come by his end in consequence.\nNevermore was he to return to wind-beaten Ilius, exulting in his\nchariot and his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name\nhad overshadowed him and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the\nnoble son of Deucalion. He had driven towards the left wing of the\nships, by which way the Achaeans used to return with their chariots and\nhorses from the plain. Hither he drove and found the gates with their\ndoors opened wide, and the great bar down--for the gatemen kept them\nopen so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be flying\ntowards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and\nhis men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the\nAchaeans would not hold out longer, and that they should now fall upon\nthe ships. Little did they know that at the gates they should find two\nof the bravest chieftains, proud sons of the fighting Lapithae--the\none, Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer\nof murderous Mars. These stood before the gates like two high oak trees\nupon the mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and\nyear after year battle with wind and rain--even so did these two men\nawait the onset of great Asius confidently and without flinching. The\nTrojans led by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of Asius,\nThoon and Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for\nthe wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a\nwhile the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to\nstand firm in the defence of their ships; when, however, they saw that\nthe Trojans were attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out\nfor help and being routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of\nthe gates like two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack\nof men and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all\nround them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the clattering\nof their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an end of them--even\nso did the gleaming bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weapons\nfell upon them; for they fought with great fury, trusting to their own\nprowess and to those who were on the wall above them. These threw great\nstones at their assailants in defence of themselves their tents and\ntheir ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow which some\nfierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets\nupon the earth--even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of\nTrojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great stones\nrained upon them, and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, in his dismay cried\naloud and smote his two thighs. \"Father Jove,\" he cried, \"of a truth\nyou too are altogether given to lying. I made sure the Argive heroes\ncould not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or bees that\nhave their nests in the rocks by the wayside--they leave not the holes\nwherein they have built undefended, but fight for their little ones\nagainst all who would take them--even so these men, though they be but\ntwo, will not be driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slay\nor be slain.\"\n\nHe spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then was to\ngive glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans were fighting\nabout the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell about\nall these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone wall\nas it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they were,\nwere forced to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defending\nthe Achaeans were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept on fighting\nwith might and main.\n\nThereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a spear\nupon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect him, for the\npoint of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so that the\nbrain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then slew\nPylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Mars, killed Hippomachus\nthe son of Antimachus by striking him with his spear upon the girdle.\nHe then drew his sword and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed\nin combat, and who fell face upwards on the earth. After him he killed\nMenon, Iamenus, and Orestes, and laid them low one after the other.\n\nWhile they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the youths\nwho were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were the greater\npart and the most valiant of those that were trying to break through\nthe wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench,\nuncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven\nwhen they had essayed to cross it--a soaring eagle that flew skirting\nthe left wing of their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its\ntalons still alive and struggling to escape. The snake was still bent\non revenge, wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the\nbird that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being in\npain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and then\nflew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck with\nterror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Jove, writhing\nin the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hector and said,\n\"Hector, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke me, even\nwhen I speak wisely, as though it were not well, forsooth, that one of\nthe people should cross your will either in the field or at the council\nboard; you would have them support you always: nevertheless I will say\nwhat I think will be best; let us not now go on to fight the Danaans at\ntheir ships, for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which\nskirted the left wing of our host with a monstrous blood-red snake in\nits talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen to\nthe Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The eagle let go her\nhold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her little ones, and so\nwill it be--with ourselves; even though by a mighty effort we break\nthrough the gates and wall of the Achaeans, and they give way before\nus, still we shall not return in good order by the way we came, but\nshall leave many a man behind us whom the Achaeans will do to death in\ndefence of their ships. Thus would any seer who was expert in these\nmatters, and was trusted by the people, read the portent.\"\n\nHector looked fiercely at him and said, \"Polydamas, I like not of your\nreading. You can find a better saying than this if you will. If,\nhowever, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed\nyou of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels of\nJove, nor to the promises he made me--and he bowed his head in\nconfirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl.\nWhat care I whether they fly towards dawn or dark, and whether they be\non my right hand or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in the\ncounsel of great Jove, king of mortals and immortals. There is one\nomen, and one only--that a man should fight for his country. Why are\nyou so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at the ships of the\nArgives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are not\nsteadfast nor courageous. If you will not fight, or would talk others\nover from doing so, you shall fall forthwith before my spear.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way, and the others followed after with a\ncry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent the blast of\na mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down\ntowards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into security, and gave\nvictory to Hector and to the Trojans, who, trusting to their own might\nand to the signs he had shown them, essayed to break through the great\nwall of the Achaeans. They tore down the breastworks from the walls,\nand overthrew the battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the\nAchaeans had set in front of the wall in order to support it; when they\nhad pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall, but\nthe Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still fenced\nthe battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled their\nmissiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall.\n\nThe two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the\nAchaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to any one\nwhom they saw to be remiss. \"My friends,\" they cried, \"Argives one and\nall--good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet, in which\nall were of equal prowess--there is now work enough, as you very well\nknow, for all of you. See that you none of you turn in flight towards\nthe ships, daunted by the shouting of the foe, but press forward and\nkeep one another in heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove the lord\nof lightning will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back\ntowards the city.\"\n\nThus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on. As the\nflakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Jove is minded to snow\nand to display these his arrows to mankind--he lulls the wind to rest,\nand snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of the high\nmountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy plains, and\nthe tilled fields of men; the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and\nhavens of the grey sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay it\nthat it can come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a\nmantle, so heavy are the heavens with snow--even thus thickly did the\nstones fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the Trojans,\nand some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was in an\nuproar.\n\nStill the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down the\ngates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon against\nthe Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle. Before him he\nheld his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith had beaten so fair\nand round, and had lined with ox hides which he had made fast with\nrivets of gold all round the shield; this he held in front of him, and\nbrandishing his two spears came on like some lion of the wilderness,\nwho has been long famished for want of meat and will dare break even\ninto a well-fenced homestead to try and get at the sheep. He may find\nthe shepherds keeping watch over their flocks with dogs and spears, but\nhe is in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try for\nit; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit by a\nspear from some strong hand--even so was Sarpedon fain to attack the\nwall and break down its battlements. Then he said to Glaucus son of\nHippolochus, \"Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive especial honour as\nregards our place at table? Why are the choicest portions served us and\nour cups kept brimming, and why do men look up to us as though we were\ngods? Moreover we hold a large estate by the banks of the river\nXanthus, fair with orchard lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us,\ntherefore, to take our stand at the head of all the Lycians and bear\nthe brunt of the fight, that one may say to another, 'Our princes in\nLycia eat the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine\nfellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.' My good\nfriend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could escape old\nage and death thenceforward and forever, I should neither press forward\nmyself nor bid you do so, but death in ten thousand shapes hangs ever\nover our heads, and no man can elude him; therefore let us go forward\nand either win glory for ourselves, or yield it to another.\"\n\nGlaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host of\nLycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw them, for it\nwas against his part of the wall that they came--bringing destruction\nwith them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to support his\ncomrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray, and\nTeucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but he\ncould not make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar\nwas there from crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates\nwith a din which reached the skies. For all the gates had been closed,\nand the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break their way\nthrough them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a message to\nAjax. \"Run, good Thootes,\" he said, \"and call Ajax, or better still bid\nboth come, for it will be all over with us here directly; the leaders\nof the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought desperately\nheretofore. But if they have too much on their hands to let them come,\nat any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer, the famous\nbowman, come with him.\"\n\nThe messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the wall of\nthe Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them, \"Sirs,\nprinces of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to him\nfor a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or it\nwill be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon\nhim, men who have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have too\nmuch on your hands to let both come, at any rate let Ajax, son of\nTelamon, do so, and let Teucer, the famous bowman, come with him.\"\n\nGreat Ajax son of Telamon heeded the message, and at once spoke to the\nson of Oileus. \"Ajax,\" said he, \"do you two, yourself and brave\nLycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\nhardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the fray, but I\nwill come back here at once as soon as I have given them the help they\nneed.\"\n\nWith this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer, his brother by the\nsame father, went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer's bow. They went\nalong inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where Menestheus\nwas (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave captains and\nleaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements as it were a thick\ndark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising the battle-cry\naloud.\n\nFirst, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of Sarpedon,\nhitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the battlements at the very\ntop of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the bloom of youth\ncould hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft\nand flung it down, smashing Epicles' four-crested helmet so that the\nbones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high\nwall as though he were diving, with no more life left in him. Then\nTeucer wounded Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on\nto attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it,\nwhich made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down\nfor fear some of the Achaeans might see that he was wounded and taunt\nhim. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he saw Glaucus leave him, still\nhe did not leave off fighting, but aimed his spear at Alcmaon the son\nof Thestor and hit him. He drew his spear back again and Alcmaon came\ndown headlong after it with his bronzed armour rattling round him. Then\nSarpedon seized the battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it\ntill it all gave way together, and a breach was made through which many\nmight pass.\n\nAjax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him with an\narrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his body, but Jove\nsaved his son from destruction that he might not fall by the ships'\nsterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield, but the\nspear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back that he\ncould come on no further. He therefore retired a little space from the\nbattlement, yet without losing all his ground, for he still thought to\ncover himself with glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave\nLycians saying, \"Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I\ncannot break through the wall and open a way to the ships\nsingle-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are of us\nthe better.\"\n\nThe Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who was\ntheir counsellor and their king. The Argives on their part got their\nmen in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly struggle\nbetween them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\ntheir way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from\nthe wall now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods\nin hand, quarrel about their boundaries in a field that they own in\ncommon, and stickle for their rights though they be but in a mere\nstrip, even so did the battlements now serve as a bone of contention,\nand they beat one another's round shields for their possession. Many a\nman's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round and\nbared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through their\nshields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with the\nblood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans could\nnot rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest\nhard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales\nbe true, for she would gain some pitiful earnings for her little ones,\neven so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the time came\nwhen Jove gave the greater glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first\nto spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. When he had done so, he\ncried aloud to the Trojans, \"Up, Trojans, break the wall of the\nArgives, and fling fire upon their ships.\"\n\nThus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight at the\nwall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements with sharp\nspears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone that lay just\noutside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other;\ntwo of the best men in a town, as men now are, could hardly raise it\nfrom the ground and put it on to a waggon, but Hector lifted it quite\neasily by himself, for the son of scheming Saturn made it light for\nhim. As a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds it\nno burden, so easily did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right\nat the doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These\ndoors were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to\nwhich there was but one key. When he had got close up to them, Hector\nstrode towards them that his blow might gain in force and struck them\nin the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke both\nhinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight. The\nportals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and the\ndoors flew open, one one way, and the other the other, through the\nforce of the blow. Then brave Hector leaped inside with a face as dark\nas that of flying night. The gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his\nbody and he had two spears in his hand. None but a god could have\nwithstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared\nlike fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them\nto scale the wall, and they did as he bade them--some of them at once\nclimbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates. The\nDanaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all was\nuproar and confusion.\n\n\n\nBOOK XIII\n\n  Neptune helps the Achaeans--The feats of Idomeneus--Hector at\n  the ships.\n\nNOW when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the ships, he\nleft them to their never-ending toil, and turned his keen eyes away,\nlooking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of Thrace, the Mysians,\nfighters at close quarters, the noble Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and\nthe Abians, justest of mankind. He no longer turned so much as a glance\ntowards Troy, for he did not think that any of the immortals would go\nand help either Trojans or Danaans.\n\nBut King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking\nadmiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of wooded\nSamothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the\nships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the sea and taken his\nplace here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were being overcome by the\nTrojans; and he was furiously angry with Jove.\n\nPresently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as he\nstrode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked beneath the\ntread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took, and with the fourth\nhe reached his goal--Aegae, where is his glittering golden palace,\nimperishable, in the depths of the sea. When he got there, he yoked his\nfleet brazen-footed steeds with their manes of gold all flying in the\nwind; he clothed himself in raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and\ntook his stand upon his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the\nsea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came\ngambolling round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in\nher gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the\nhorses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet beneath it;\nand thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nNow there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea midway\nbetween Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the earthquake\nstayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial\nforage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of gold which none could\neither unloose or break, so that they might stay there in that place\nuntil their lord should return. This done he went his way to the host\nof the Achaeans.\n\nNow the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like a\nstorm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and raising\nthe cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of the\nAchaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\nearth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives,\nfor he had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of\nCalchas.\n\nFirst he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best already,\nand said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the Achaeans if you\nwill put out all your strength and not let yourselves be daunted. I am\nnot afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force, will\nbe victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them\nin check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where\nfurious Hector, who boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is\nleading them on like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into\nyour hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the\nlike. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though he be\ninspired by Jove himself.\"\n\nAs he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck both of\nthem with his sceptre and filled their hearts with daring. He made\ntheir legs light and active, as also their hands and their feet. Then,\nas the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer rock,\nand presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even so\ndid Neptune lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and\nleave them. Of the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know\nwho it was that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of\nTelamon, \"Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in\nthe likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by our ships. It\nwas not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I knew him at once by\nhis feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are soon recognised.\nMoreover I feel the lust of battle burn more fiercely within me, while\nmy hands and my feet under me are more eager for the fray.\"\n\nAnd Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"I too feel my hands grasp my spear\nmore firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more nimble; I long,\nmoreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam, even in single combat.\"\n\nThus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with which\nthe god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler roused the\nAchaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once by\nhard fighting and by grief at seeing that the Trojans had got over the\nwall in force. Tears began falling from their eyes as they beheld them,\nfor they made sure that they should not escape destruction; but the\nlord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and urged their\nbattalions to the front.\n\nFirst he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and Thoas and\nDeipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant warriors; all did he\nexhort. \"Shame on you young Argives,\" he cried, \"it was on your prowess\nI relied for the saving of our ships; if you fight not with might and\nmain, this very day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my\neyes behold a great and terrible portent which I had never thought to\nsee--the Trojans at our ships--they, who were heretofore like\npanic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with\nno strength but in flight for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto\nthe Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of the Achaeans,\nbut now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our\nvery ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection of\nthe people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight in\ndefence of the ships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King\nAgamemnon son of Atreus is the cause of our disaster by having insulted\nthe son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave off\nfighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal\nquickly. You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers\nin our whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a\nweakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good friends,\nmatters will soon become even worse through this slackness; think, each\none of you, of his own honour and credit, for the hazard of the fight\nis extreme. Great Hector is now fighting at our ships; he has broken\nthrough the gates and the strong bolt that held them.\"\n\nThus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them on.\nThereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of men, of\nwhom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could make light if\nthey went among them, for they were the picked men of all those who\nwere now awaiting the onset of Hector and the Trojans. They made a\nliving fence, spear to spear, shield to shield, buckler to buckler,\nhelmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on their\ngleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely\nserried were they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands\nwere interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle.\n\nThe Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head\npressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side of some\nmountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the\nfoundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and\nas it bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar;\nit swerves neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground, but\nthen for all its fury it can go no further--even so easily did Hector\nfor a while seem as though he would career through the tents and ships\nof the Achaeans till he had reached the sea in his murderous course;\nbut the closely serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for\nthe sons of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed\nat both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gave\nground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans, Lycians, and\nDardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans have set\nthemselves as a wall against me, but they will not check me for long;\nthey will give ground before me if the mightiest of the gods, the\nthundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my onset.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus son of\nPriam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with his round\nshield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly forward.\nMeriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the broad\norb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear broke in\ntwo pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it\ncoming and had held his shield well away from him. Meriones drew back\nunder cover of his comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish\nDeiphobus, and having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the\nships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.\n\nThe others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into the\nheavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man, to wit,\nthe warrior Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich in horses. Until the Achaeans\ncame he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesicaste, a bastard\ndaughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he had gone\nback to Ilius, and was a great man among the Trojans, dwelling near\nPriam himself, who gave him like honour with his own sons. The son of\nTelamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he then drew\nback again, and Imbrius fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled\non the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green\nfoliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his\nbronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang\nforward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was doing so,\nHector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and\nswerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son of Cteatus son of Actor,\nin the chest as he was coming into battle, and his armour rang rattling\nround him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hector sprang forward to\ntake Amphimachus's helmet from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax\nthrew a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased all\nover in his terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of\nhis shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,\nwhich the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus, captains of\nthe Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of the Achaeans, while\nthe two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the like by Imbrius. As two\nlions snatch a goat from the hounds that have it in their fangs, and\nbear it through thick brushwood high above the ground in their jaws,\nthus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrius, and strip it of its\narmour. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from the neck in\nrevenge for the death of Amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the\ncrowd as though it had been a ball, till it fell in the dust at\nHector's feet.\n\nNeptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus should have\nfallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of the Achaeans to\nurge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for the Trojans.\nIdomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had just\ncome to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-soldiers\nbore him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the\nphysicians went on to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle.\nNeptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of\nAndraemon who ruled the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and\nwas honoured among his people as though he were a god. \"Idomeneus,\"\nsaid he, \"lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats\nwith which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?\"\n\nAnd Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, \"Thoas, no one, so far\nas I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are held back\nneither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the will of almighty\nJove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here far from Argos:\nyou, Thoas, have been always staunch, and you keep others in heart if\nyou see any fail in duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do\ntheir utmost.\"\n\nTo this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, \"Idomeneus, may he\nnever return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten upon, who is\nthis day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour and go, we must\nmake all haste together if we may be of any use, though we are only\ntwo. Even cowards gain courage from companionship, and we two can hold\nour own with the bravest.\"\n\nTherewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and Idomeneus\nwhen he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped his two spears,\nand sallied forth. As the lightning which the son of Saturn brandishes\nfrom bright Olympus when he would show a sign to mortals, and its gleam\nflashes far and wide--even so did his armour gleam about him as he ran.\nMeriones his sturdy squire met him while he was still near his tent\n(for he was going to fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said:\n\n\"Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you left the\nfield? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon hurting you? or\nhave you been sent to fetch me? I want no fetching; I had far rather\nfight than stay in my tent.\"\n\n\"Idomeneus,\" answered Meriones, \"I come for a spear, if I can find one\nin my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it at the shield\nof Deiphobus.\"\n\nAnd Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, \"You will find one\nspear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end wall of\nmy tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have killed, for I am\nnot one to keep my enemy at arm's length; therefore I have spears,\nbossed shields, helmets, and burnished corslets.\"\n\nThen Meriones said, \"I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils taken\nfrom the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at all times\nvalorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting have held my own\namong the foremost. There may be those among the Achaeans who do not\nknow how I fight, but you know it well enough yourself.\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"I know you for a brave man: you need not tell me.\nIf the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush--and\nthere is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of; it comes\nout then who is cowardly and who brave; the coward will change colour\nat every touch and turn; he is full of fears, and keeps shifting his\nweight first on one knee and then on the other; his heart beats fast as\nhe thinks of death, and one can hear the chattering of his teeth;\nwhereas the brave man will not change colour nor be frightened on\nfinding himself in ambush, but is all the time longing to go into\naction--if the best men were being chosen for such a service, no one\ncould make light of your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck\nby a dart or smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in\nyour neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly\nas you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But let us\nno longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill spoken of;\ngo, fetch your spear from the tent at once.\"\n\nOn this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself a\nspear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with great deeds\nof valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to battle, and his son\nPanic so strong and dauntless goes with him, to strike terror even into\nthe heart of a hero--the pair have gone from Thrace to arm themselves\namong the Ephyri or the brave Phlegyans, but they will not listen to\nboth the contending hosts, and will give victory to one side or to the\nother--even so did Meriones and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to\nbattle clad in their bronze armour. Meriones was first to speak. \"Son\nof Deucalion,\" said he, \"where would you have us begin fighting? On the\nright wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing, where I\ntake it the Achaeans will be weakest?\"\n\nIdomeneus answered, \"There are others to defend the centre--the two\nAjaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the Achaeans, and is\ngood also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will give Hector son of Priam\nenough to do; fight as he may, he will find it hard to vanquish their\nindomitable fury, and fire the ships, unless the son of Saturn fling a\nfirebrand upon them with his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will\nyield to no man who is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if\nbronze and great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to\nAchilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is none\nto beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing, that we may\nknow forthwith whether we are to give glory to some other, or he to us.\"\n\nMeriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to the\npart of the host which Idomeneus had named.\n\nNow when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of fire, him\nand his squire clad in their richly wrought armour, they shouted and\nmade towards him all in a body, and a furious hand-to-hand fight raged\nunder the ships' sterns. Fierce as the shrill winds that whistle upon a\nday when dust lies deep on the roads, and the gusts raise it into a\nthick cloud--even such was the fury of the combat, and might and main\ndid they hack at each other with spear and sword throughout the host.\nThe field bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.\nDazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their fresh-burnished\nbreastplates, and glittering shields as they joined battle with one\nanother. Iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in the\nsight of such a turmoil, and look on it without being dismayed.\n\nThus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal heroes.\nJove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to Hector, so as to\ndo honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did not mean to utterly\noverthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and only wanted to glorify\nThetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the other hand went about among\nthe Argives to incite them, having come up from the grey sea in secret,\nfor he was grieved at seeing them vanquished by the Trojans, and was\nfuriously angry with Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but\nJove was elder born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend\nthe Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on encouraging\nthem throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two devise a knot of\nwar and battle, that none could unloose or break, and set both sides\ntugging at it, to the failing of men's knees beneath them.\n\nAnd now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,\ncalled loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as he\nleaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a sojourner, who\nhad but lately come to take part in the war. He sought Cassandra, the\nfairest of Priam's daughters, in marriage, but offered no gifts of\nwooing, for he promised a great thing, to wit, that he would drive the\nsons of the Achaeans willy nilly from Troy; old King Priam had given\nhis consent and promised her to him, whereon he fought on the strength\nof the promises thus made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him\nas he came striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and\nthe spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground.\nThen Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, \"Othryoneus, there is no one in\nthe world whom I shall admire more than I do you, if you indeed perform\nwhat you have promised Priam son of Dardanus in return for his\ndaughter. We too will make you an offer; we will give you the loveliest\ndaughter of the son of Atreus, and will bring her from Argos for you to\nmarry, if you will sack the goodly city of Ilius in company with\nourselves; so come along with me, that we may make a covenant at the\nships about the marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts\nof wooing.\"\n\nWith this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the thick of\nthe fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on foot, in front of\nhis horses which his esquire drove so close behind him that he could\nfeel their breath upon his shoulder. He was longing to strike down\nIdomeneus, but ere he could do so Idomeneus smote him with his spear in\nthe throat under the chin, and the bronze point went clean through it.\nHe fell as an oak, or poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for\nship's timber upon the mountains with whetted axes--even thus did he\nlie full length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth\nand clutching at the bloodstained dust. His charioteer was struck with\npanic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape: thereupon\nAntilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a spear; his cuirass\nof bronze did not protect him, and the spear stuck in his belly. He\nfell gasping from his chariot and Antilochus, great Nestor's son, drove\nhis horses from the Trojans to the Achaeans.\n\nDeiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and took aim\nat him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided it,\nfor he was covered by the round shield he always bore--a shield of\noxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched under\ncover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang out as\nthe spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong\nhand of Deiphobus, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of\nhis people, in the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed\nbeneath him. Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice\nsaying, \"Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be glad\neven while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden of the gate,\nthat I have sent some one to escort him.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying. Noble\nAntilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him\nforget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and\ncovered him with his shield; then two of his staunch comrades,\nMecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, stooped down, and bore him away\ngroaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He\nkept on striving continually either to enshroud some Trojan in the\ndarkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil day\nfrom the Achaeans. Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes; he was\nson-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia,\nwho was the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her\ngeneration in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the\nbravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife--him did Neptune lay low\nby the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and binding his\nstrong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one\nside, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus\nstruck him with a spear in the middle of his chest. The coat of mail\nthat had hitherto protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly\nas the spear tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the\nspear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end of\nthe spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life. Idomeneus\nvaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Deiphobus, since\nyou are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\nthree men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that\nyou may learn what manner of Jove-begotten man am I that have come\nhither. Jove first begot Minos, chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his\nturn begot a son, noble Deucalion. Deucalion begot me to be a ruler\nover many men in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to be\nthe bane of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go back\nand fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the challenge\nsingle-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch Aeneas,\nwhom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved with\nPriam because in spite of his brave deeds he did not give him his due\nshare of honour. Deiphobus went up to him and said, \"Aeneas, prince\namong the Trojans, if you know any ties of kinship, help me now to\ndefend the body of your sister's husband; come with me to the rescue of\nAlcathous, who being husband to your sister brought you up when you\nwere a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.\"\n\nWith these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in pursuit\nof Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but Idomeneus was not to\nbe thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held his ground as a\nwild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a great\ncrowd of men in some lonely place--the bristles stand upright on his\nback, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to\ndefend himself against hounds and men--even so did famed Idomeneus hold\nhis ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud to his\ncomrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones, and\nAntilochus, all of them brave soldiers--\"Hither my friends,\" he cried,\n\"and leave me not single-handed--I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas,\nwho is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of death\nbattle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man's strength is\ngreatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my present mind,\neither he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory.\"\n\nOn this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on shoulder.\nAeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking towards\nDeiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of the Trojans along\nwith himself, and the people followed them as sheep follow the ram when\nthey go down to drink after they have been feeding, and the heart of\nthe shepherd is glad--even so was the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he\nsaw his people follow him.\n\nThen they fought furiously in close combat about the body of Alcathous,\nwielding their long spears; and the bronze armour about their bodies\nrang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press of the\nfight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Mars,\noutvied everyone in their desire to hack at each other with sword and\nspear. Aeneas took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and\navoided the spear, so that it sped from Aeneas' strong hand in vain,\nand fell quivering in the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in\nthe middle of his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon\nhis bowels came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of\nhis hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear\nout of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his armour for\nthe rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\nwas now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge, and\ncould neither spring forward to recover his own weapon nor swerve aside\nto avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended\nhimself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him\nswiftly out of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was\nretreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was as\nfierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Ascalaphus, the son of\nMars; the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in\nthe palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust.\n\nGrim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had fallen, for\nhe was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the golden clouds, by\ncommand of Jove, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden to\ntake part in the battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the body.\nDeiphobus tore the helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang upon\nhim, and struck him on the arm with a spear so that the visored helmet\nfell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon\nMeriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his\nshoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own\nbrother of Deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him\naway from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in\nthe rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him\ntowards the city groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing\nfrom his arm.\n\nThe others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven without\nceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and struck him with\na spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head fell on\none side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death,\nlife's foe, was shed around him. Antilochus spied his chance, flew\nforward towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid\nopen the vein that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut\nthis vein clean away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the\ndust face upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his\ncomrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from his\nshoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans came\nabout him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, but\ncould not wound his body, for Neptune stood guard over the son of\nNestor, though the darts fell thickly round him. He was never clear of\nthe foe, but was always in the thick of the fight; his spear was never\nidle; he poised and aimed it in every direction, so eager was he to hit\nsomeone from a distance or to fight him hand to hand.\n\nAs he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas, son of\nAsius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in the middle\nof his shield, but Neptune made its point without effect, for he\ngrudged him the life of Antilochus. One half, therefore, of the spear\nstuck fast like a charred stake in Antilochus's shield, while the other\nlay on the ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men,\nbut Meriones followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the\nprivate parts and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to\nwretched mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed\nconvulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen have\nbound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce. Even so did he\nmove convulsively for a while, but not for very long, till Meriones\ncame up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were veiled in\ndarkness.\n\nHelenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting him\non the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his head; the\nhelmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were fighting on the\nAchaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but the eyes\nof Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of death.\n\nOn this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards Helenus,\nbrandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the two attacked\none another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the\nother with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam hit the breastplate of\nMenelaus's corslet, but the arrow glanced from off it. As black beans\nor pulse come pattering down on to a threshing-floor from the broad\nwinnowing-shovel, blown by shrill winds and shaken by the shovel--even\nso did the arrow glance off and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who\nin his turn wounded the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the\nspear went right through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that\nto his life he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging\nby his side--for the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out and\nbound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his esquire had\nwith him.\n\nPisander then made straight at Menelaus--his evil destiny luring him on\nto his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O Menelaus. When the\ntwo were hard by one another the spear of the son of Atreus turned\naside and he missed his aim; Pisander then struck the shield of brave\nMenelaus but could not pierce it, for the shield stayed the spear and\nbroke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory;\nforthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon\nhim. Pisander then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its long and\npolished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,\nand the two made at one another. Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus's\ncrested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander\nas he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his\nnose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his\nfeet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and Menelaus set his\nheel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and vaunted over him saying,\n\"Even thus shall you Trojans leave the ships of the Achaeans, proud and\ninsatiate of battle though you be, nor shall you lack any of the\ndisgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself. Cowardly\nshe-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger of dread Jove,\navenger of violated hospitality, who will one day destroy your city;\nyou stole my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when\nyou were her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and\nkill our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be\nstayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods and\nmen, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do proceed, how\ncan you thus favour the Trojans--men so proud and overweening, that\nthey are never tired of fighting? All things pall after a while--sleep,\nlove, sweet song, and stately dance--still these are things of which a\nman would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of\nbattle that the Trojans are insatiate.\"\n\nSo saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the body of\nPisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again ranged himself\namong those who were in the front of the fight.\n\nHarpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had come to\nfight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go home again. He\nstruck the middle of Menelaus's shield with his spear but could not\npierce it, and to save his life drew back under cover of his men,\nlooking round him on every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones\naimed a bronze-tipped arrow at him as he was leaving the field, and hit\nhim on the right buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and\nthrough, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and\nbreathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm\nupon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from\nhis wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they\nraised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of\nTroy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but there was no\nransom that could bring his dead son to life again.\n\nParis was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his host\nwhen he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow, therefore, in\norder to avenge him. Now there was a certain man named Euchenor, son of\nPolyidus the prophet, a brave man and wealthy, whose home was in\nCorinth. This Euchenor had set sail for Troy well knowing that it would\nbe the death of him, for his good old father Polyidus had often told\nhim that he must either stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or\ngo with the Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,\ntherefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would have\nlaid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and suffering of\ndisease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his ear, whereon the life\nwent out of him and he was enshrouded in the darkness of death.\n\nThus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector had not\nyet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making havoc of his\nmen on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere long would\nhave triumphed over them, so vigorously did Neptune cheer them on and\nhelp them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first forced\nhis way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the\nserried ranks of Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax\nand Protesilaus were drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at\nits lowest, and the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely.\nThe Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the Locrians, the\nmen of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans could hardly stay\nHector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could they drive him from\nthem, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the Athenians\nwere in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos, with whom were also\nPheidas, Stichius, and stalwart Bias; Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion,\nand Dracius commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarces led\nthe men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and\nbrother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country, for\nhe had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis, the wife of\nOileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus, son of Phylacus.\nThese two stood in the van of the Phthians, and defended the ships\nalong with the Boeotians.\n\nAjax son of Oileus, never for a moment left the side of Ajax, son of\nTelamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the plough\nwhich they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat steams upwards\nfrom about the roots of their horns--nothing but the yoke divides them\nas they break up the ground till they reach the end of the field--even\nso did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to shoulder by one another. Many\nand brave comrades followed the son of Telamon, to relieve him of his\nshield when he was overcome with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did\nnot follow so close after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold\ntheir own in a hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets with\nplumes of horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but\nthey had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool\nfrom which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the\nTrojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the brunt\nof the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the Locrians shot\nfrom behind, under their cover; and thus the Trojans began to lose\nheart, for the arrows threw them into confusion.\n\nThe Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the ships\nand tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently said to\nHector, \"Hector, there is no persuading you to take advice. Because\nheaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of war, you think that\nyou must therefore excel others in counsel; but you cannot thus claim\npreeminence in all things. Heaven has made one man an excellent\nsoldier; of another it has made a dancer or a singer and player on the\nlyre; while yet in another Jove has implanted a wise understanding of\nwhich men reap fruit to the saving of many, and he himself knows more\nabout it than any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best.\nThe fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now that\nthe Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full\narmour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered near the\nships. Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains round you, that\nwe may advise together whether to fall now upon the ships in the hope\nthat heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to beat a retreat while we can\nyet safely do so. I greatly fear that the Achaeans will pay us their\ndebt of yesterday in full, for there is one abiding at their ships who\nis never weary of battle, and who will not hold aloof much longer.\"\n\nThus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He sprang in\nfull armour from his chariot and said, \"Polydamas, gather the\nchieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but will return at\nonce when I have given them their orders.\"\n\nHe then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a loud\ncry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies. When they\nheard his voice they all hastened to gather round Polydamas, the\nexcellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on among the foremost,\nlooking everywhere to find Deiphobus and prince Helenus, Adamas son of\nAsius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus; living, indeed, and scatheless he\ncould no longer find them, for the two last were lying by the sterns of\nthe Achaean ships, slain by the Argives, while the others had been also\nstricken and wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread\nbattle he found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men\nand urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him.\n\"Paris,\" said he, \"evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad and\nfalse of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where are Adamas\nson of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is Othryoneus? Ilius\nis undone and will now surely fall!\"\n\nAlexandrus answered, \"Hector, why find fault when there is no one to\nfind fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day rather than\nthis, for my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me. From\nthe moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have been\nstaying here and doing battle with the Danaans. Our comrades about whom\nyou ask me are dead; Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the\nfield, wounded both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved\nthem alive. Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we\nwill follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so\nfar as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him lies,\nno matter how willing he may be.\"\n\nWith these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went towards the\npart of the battle where the fight was thickest, about Cebriones, brave\nPolydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and\nMorys son of Hippotion, who had come from fertile Ascania on the\npreceding day to relieve other troops. Then Jove urged them on to\nfight. They flew forth like the blasts of some fierce wind that strike\nearth in the van of a thunderstorm--they buffet the salt sea into an\nuproar; many and mighty are the great waves that come crashing in one\nafter the other upon the shore with their arching heads all crested\nwith foam--even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming\narmour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector son of\nPriam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield before him--his\nshield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze--and his gleaming\nhelmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under cover of his\nshield in every direction, making trial of the ranks to see if they\nwould give way before him, but he could not daunt the courage of the\nAchaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and challenge him. \"Sir,\" he\ncried, \"draw near; why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives?\nWe Achaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen\nheavily upon us. Your heart, forsooth, is set on destroying our ships,\nbut we too have hands that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town\nshall be sooner taken and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when\nyou shall pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds\nmay be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear\nyou back to your city.\"\n\nAs he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and the\nhost of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the omen. But\nHector answered, \"Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I were\nas sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Jove, with Queen\nJuno for my mother, and of being held in like honour with Minerva and\nApollo, as I am that this day is big with the destruction of the\nAchaeans; and you shall fall among them if you dare abide my spear; it\nshall rend your fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey\nwith your fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith these words he led the way and the others followed after with a\ncry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them. The Argives\non their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget their\nprowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains,\nand the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness\nof Jove's presence.\n\n\n\nBOOK XIV\n\n  Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and\n  is rebuked by Ulysses--Juno beguiles Jupiter--Hector is\n  wounded.\n\nNESTOR was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not escape\nhim, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, \"What, noble Machaon, is\nthe meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting by our ships grow\nstronger and stronger; stay here, therefore, and sit over your wine,\nwhile fair Hecamede heats you a bath and washes the clotted blood from\noff you. I will go at once to the look-out station and see what it is\nall about.\"\n\nAs he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was lying\nin his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had taken his\nfather's shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and as\nsoon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of the Achaeans who, now\nthat their wall was overthrown, were flying pell-mell before the\nTrojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon the sea, but the waves are\ndumb--they keep their eyes on the watch for the quarter whence the\nfierce winds may spring upon them, but they stay where they are and set\nneither this way nor that, till some particular wind sweeps down from\nheaven to determine them--even so did the old man ponder whether to\nmake for the crowd of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end\nhe deemed it best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts\nwere fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on\ntheir bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and\nspears.\n\nThe wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son of\nAtreus, fell in with Nestor as they were coming up from their\nships--for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting was\ngoing on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been beached\nfirst, while the wall had been built behind the hindermost. The stretch\nof the shore, wide though it was, did not afford room for all the\nships, and the host was cramped for space, therefore they had placed\nthe ships in rows one behind the other, and had filled the whole\nopening of the bay between the two points that formed it. The kings,\nleaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight, being in\ngreat anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with\ndismay. Then King Agamemnon said to him, \"Nestor son of Neleus, honour\nto the Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I\nfear that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among\nthe Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had fired\nour ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it is all coming\ntrue. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles, are in such anger with\nme that they refuse to fight by the sterns of our ships.\"\n\nThen Nestor knight of Gerene, answered, \"It is indeed as you say; it is\nall coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders from on high\ncannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we relied as an\nimpregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The Trojans are fighting\nstubbornly and without ceasing at the ships; look where you may you\ncannot see from what quarter the rout of the Achaeans is coming; they\nare being killed in a confused mass and the battle-cry ascends to\nheaven; let us think, if counsel can be of any use, what we had better\ndo; but I do not advise our going into battle ourselves, for a man\ncannot fight when he is wounded.\"\n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed\nfighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench\nhas served us--over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they\ndeemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet--I see\nit must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish\ningloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove was willing to\ndefend us, and I know now that he is raising the Trojans to like honour\nwith the gods, while us, on the other hand, he has bound hand and foot.\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us bring down the ships\nthat are on the beach and draw them into the water; let us make them\nfast to their mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of\nnight--if even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may\nthen draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying\nruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and be\nsaved than be caught and killed.\"\n\nUlysses looked fiercely at him and said, \"Son of Atreus, what are you\ntalking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other and baser\narmy, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has allotted a life of\nhard fighting from youth to old age, till we every one of us perish. Is\nit thus that you would quit the city of Troy, to win which we have\nsuffered so much hardship? Hold your peace, lest some other of the\nAchaeans hear you say what no man who knows how to give good counsel,\nno king over so great a host as that of the Argives should ever have\nlet fall from his lips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you\nhave been saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into the\nwater while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the hands\nof the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans will not go\non fighting when they see the ships being drawn into the water, but\nwill cease attacking and keep turning their eyes towards them; your\ncounsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our destruction.\"\n\nAgamemnon answered, \"Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the heart. I\nam not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their ships into the sea\nwhether they will or no. Someone, it may be, old or young, can offer us\nbetter counsel which I shall rejoice to hear.\"\n\nThen said Diomed, \"Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek, if\nyou will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am younger\nthan any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire, Tydeus, who lies\nburied at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble sons, two of whom,\nAgrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky Calydon. The third was the\nknight Oeneus, my father's father, and he was the most valiant of them\nall. Oeneus remained in his own country, but my father (as Jove and the\nother gods ordained it) migrated to Argos. He married into the family\nof Adrastus, and his house was one of great abundance, for he had large\nestates of rich corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well,\nand he had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use\nof the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether these things are\ntrue or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as though I\nwere a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us go to the fight\nas we needs must, wounded though we be. When there, we may keep out of\nthe battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds\nin addition to what we have already, but we can spur on others, who\nhave been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle\nhitherto.\"\n\nThus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set out,\nKing Agamemnon leading the way.\n\nMeanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them in\nthe semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon's right hand in his own\nand said, \"Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now that he sees\nthe Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly without remorse--may\nhe come to a bad end and heaven confound him. As for yourself, the\nblessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry with you but that the\nprinces and counsellors of the Trojans shall again raise the dust upon\nthe plain, and you shall see them flying from the ships and tents\ntowards their city.\"\n\nWith this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to the\nplain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of nine or\nten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a fight, and it\nput fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans to wage war and do\nbattle without ceasing.\n\nJuno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of\nOlympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was at once\nher brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and thither amid\nthe fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he sat on the topmost\ncrests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed him. She set herself to\nthink how she might hoodwink him, and in the end she deemed that it\nwould be best for her to go to Ida and array herself in rich attire, in\nthe hope that Jove might become enamoured of her, and wish to embrace\nher. While he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made\nto steal over his eyes and senses.\n\nShe went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made her, and\nthe doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of a secret key\nso that no other god could open them. Here she entered and closed the\ndoors behind her. She cleansed all the dirt from her fair body with\nambrosia, then she anointed herself with olive oil, ambrosial, very\nsoft, and scented specially for herself--if it were so much as shaken\nin the bronze-floored house of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of\nheaven and earth. With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then\nshe plaited the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden\ntresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous robe which\nMinerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had embroidered\nwith manifold devices; she fastened it about her bosom with golden\nclasps, and she girded herself with a girdle that had a hundred\ntassels: then she fastened her earrings, three brilliant pendants that\nglistened most beautifully, through the pierced lobes of her ears, and\nthrew a lovely new veil over her head. She bound her sandals on to her\nfeet, and when she had arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction,\nshe left her room and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. \"My\ndear child,\" said she, \"will you do what I am going to ask of you, or\nwill you refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan\nside, while you are on the Trojan?\"\n\nJove's daughter Venus answered, \"Juno, august queen of goddesses,\ndaughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it for you\nat once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.\"\n\nThen Juno told her a lying tale and said, \"I want you to endow me with\nsome of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring all things\nmortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the world's end to\nvisit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and mother Tethys: they\nreceived me in their house, took care of me, and brought me up, having\ntaken me over from Rhaea when Jove imprisoned great Saturn in the\ndepths that are under earth and sea. I must go and see them that I may\nmake peace between them; they have been quarrelling, and are so angry\nthat they have not slept with one another this long while; if I can\nbring them round and restore them to one another's embraces, they will\nbe grateful to me and love me for ever afterwards.\"\n\nThereon laughter-loving Venus said, \"I cannot and must not refuse you,\nfor you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.\"\n\nAs she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered girdle\ninto which all her charms had been wrought--love, desire, and that\nsweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the most prudent. She\ngave the girdle to Juno and said, \"Take this girdle wherein all my\ncharms reside and lay it in your bosom. If you will wear it I promise\nyou that your errand, be it what it may, will not be bootless.\"\n\nWhen she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the girdle\nin her bosom.\n\nVenus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted down from\nthe summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair Emathia, and\nwent on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of the Thracian\nhorsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without ever setting foot\nto ground. When she came to Athos she went on over the waves of the sea\ntill she reached Lemnos, the city of noble Thoas. There she met Sleep,\nown brother to Death, and caught him by the hand, saying, \"Sleep, you\nwho lord it alike over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a\nservice in times past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to\nyou ever after. Close Jove's keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold\nhim clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden seat,\nthat can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan shall make it\nfor you, and he shall give it a footstool for you to rest your fair\nfeet upon when you are at table.\"\n\nThen Sleep answered, \"Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of\nmighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep without\ncompunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus from whom all of\nthem proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor send him to sleep unless\nhe bids me. I have had one lesson already through doing what you asked\nme, on the day when Jove's mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius\nafter having sacked the city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused\nmy sweet self over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to\nrest; meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts\nof the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the\ngoodly city of Cos, away from all his friends. Jove was furious when he\nawoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the house; he was\nlooking more particularly for myself, and would have flung me down\nthrough space into the sea where I should never have been heard of any\nmore, had not Night who cows both men and gods protected me. I fled to\nher and Jove left off looking for me in spite of his being so angry,\nfor he did not dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are\nagain asking me to do something on which I cannot venture.\"\n\nAnd Juno said, \"Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into your\nhead? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the Trojans, as he\nwas about his own son? Come, I will marry you to one of the youngest of\nthe Graces, and she shall be your own--Pasithea, whom you have always\nwanted to marry.\"\n\nSleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, \"Then swear it to\nme by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on the bounteous\nearth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so that all the gods who\ndwell down below with Saturn may be our witnesses, and see that you\nreally do give me one of the youngest of the Graces--Pasithea, whom I\nhave always wanted to marry.\"\n\nJuno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of the\nnether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had completed\nher oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist and sped\nlightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them. Presently they\nreached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Lectum where\nthey left the sea to go on by land, and the tops of the trees of the\nforest soughed under the going of their feet. Here Sleep halted, and\nere Jove caught sight of him he climbed a lofty pine-tree--the tallest\nthat reared its head towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind\nthe branches and sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird\nthat haunts the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men\ncall it Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida,\nand Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he did so\nhe became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her that he had\nfelt when they had first enjoyed each other's embraces, and slept with\none another without their dear parents knowing anything about it. He\nwent up to her and said, \"What do you want that you have come hither\nfrom Olympus--and that too with neither chariot nor horses to convey\nyou?\"\n\nThen Juno told him a lying tale and said, \"I am going to the world's\nend, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and mother\nTethys; they received me into their house, took care of me, and brought\nme up. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them: they\nhave been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not slept with\none another this long time. The horses that will take me over land and\nsea are stationed on the lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I\nhave come here from Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you\nmight be angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus\nwithout letting you know.\"\n\nAnd Jove said, \"Juno, you can choose some other time for paying your\nvisit to Oceanus--for the present let us devote ourselves to love and\nto the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been so overpowered\nby passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as I am at this moment\nfor yourself--not even when I was in love with the wife of Ixion who\nbore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel, nor yet with Danae the\ndaintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who bore me the famed hero\nPerseus. Then there was the daughter of Phoenix, who bore me Minos and\nRhadamanthus: there was Semele, and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot\nmy lion-hearted son Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the\ncomforter of mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and\nyourself--but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I now\nam with you.\"\n\nJuno again answered him with a lying tale. \"Most dread son of Saturn,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"what are you talking about? Would you have us enjoy one\nanother here on the top of Mount Ida, where everything can be seen?\nWhat if one of the ever-living gods should see us sleeping together,\nand tell the others? It would be such a scandal that when I had risen\nfrom your embraces I could never show myself inside your house again;\nbut if you are so minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has\nmade me, and he has given it good strong doors; if you would so have\nit, let us go thither and lie down.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"Juno, you need not be afraid that either god or man\nwill see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a dense golden\ncloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing beams shall not\nsee through it.\"\n\nWith this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace; whereon the\nearth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with dew-bespangled\nlotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick that it raised them well\nabove the ground. Here they laid themselves down and overhead they were\ncovered by a fair cloud of gold, from which there fell glittering\ndew-drops.\n\nThus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the crest\nof Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his spouse in\nhis arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the Achaeans, to\ntell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the earthquake. When he had\nfound him he said, \"Now, Neptune, you can help the Danaans with a will,\nand give them victory though it be only for a short time while Jove is\nstill sleeping. I have sent him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has\nbeguiled him into going to bed with her.\"\n\nSleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind, leaving\nNeptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He darted forward\namong the first ranks and shouted saying, \"Argives, shall we let Hector\nson of Priam have the triumph of taking our ships and covering himself\nwith glory? This is what he says that he shall now do, seeing that\nAchilles is still in dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well\nwithout him if we keep each other in heart and stand by one another.\nNow, therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and\nlargest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally forth\nwith our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you on, and Hector\nson of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold out against us. If\nany good staunch soldier has only a small shield, let him hand it over\nto a worse man, and take a larger one for himself.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of Tydeus,\nUlysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the others in\narray, and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour; the\nmost valiant took the best armour, and gave the worse to the worse man.\nWhen they had donned their bronze armour they marched on with Neptune\nat their head. In his strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen\nof edge and flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in\nthe day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.\n\nHector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon Neptune and\nHector waged fierce war on one another--Hector on the Trojan and\nNeptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as the two forces\nmet; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and tents of the\nAchaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more loudly when driven\nbefore the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames of a forest fire roar\nmore fiercely when it is well alight upon the mountains, nor does the\nwind bellow with ruder music as it tears on through the tops of when it\nis blowing its hardest, than the terrible shout which the Trojans and\nAchaeans raised as they sprang upon one another.\n\nHector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards him,\nnor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two bands passed\nover his chest--the band of his shield and that of his silver-studded\nsword--and these protected his body. Hector was angry that his spear\nshould have been hurled in vain, and withdrew under cover of his men.\nAs he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon, struck him with a\nstone, of which there were many lying about under the men's feet as\nthey fought--brought there to give support to the ships' sides as they\nlay on the shore. Ajax caught up one of them and struck Hector above\nthe rim of his shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round\nlike a top and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when\nuprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a terrible\nsmell of brimstone--no man can help being dismayed if he is standing\nnear it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing--even so did Hector\nfall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his\nshield and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armour\nrang about him.\n\nThe sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards him,\nhoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on the Trojans,\nbut none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and covered\nby the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon captain of the\nLycians, and noble Glaucus. Of the others, too, there was not one who\nwas unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to\ncover him. His comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him\naway from the battle to the place where his horses stood waiting for\nhim at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot; these\nthen took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they\nreached the ford of the fair stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal\nJove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the\nground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he breathed\nagain and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he vomited blood,\nbut soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again closed in\ndarkness for he was still stunned by the blow.\n\nWhen the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart and set\nupon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of Oileus began by\nspringing on Satnius son of Enops, and wounding him with his spear: a\nfair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as he was herding cattle by the\nbanks of the river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came up to him and\nstruck him in the flank so that he fell, and a fierce fight between\nTrojans and Danaans raged round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous\ndrew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the\nright shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and\nhe clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted loudly\nover him saying, \"Again I take it that the spear has not sped in vain\nfrom the strong hand of the son of Panthous; an Argive has caught it in\nhis body, and it will serve him for a staff as he goes down into the\nhouse of Hades.\"\n\nThe Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon was\nmore angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him; so he\naimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\nswerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus son of Antenor, for\nheaven counselled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs\nfrom the neck at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the\ntendons at the back of the head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached\nthe ground long before his legs and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted\nto Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this\nman is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and\nof rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for\nhe is very like him.\"\n\nBut he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly angered.\nAcamas then bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promachus the\nBoeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag his brother's body\naway. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Argive archers, braggarts\nthat you are, toil and suffering shall not be for us only, but some of\nyou too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See how Promachus now\nsleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother's blood has not\nbeen long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves\na kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\"\n\nHis taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than\nany of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not stand his\nground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas,\nwhom Mercury had favoured and endowed with greater wealth than any\nother of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his only son, and Peneleos now\nwounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from\nits socket: the spear went right through the eye into the nape of the\nneck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then\ndrew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet\ncame tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in the\neye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, and\nshowed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\"\nhe cried, \"bid the father and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for\nhim in their house, for the wife also of Promachus son of Alegenor will\nnever be gladdened by the coming of her dear husband--when we Argives\nreturn with our ships from Troy.\"\n\nAs he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about to\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\n\nTell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of the\nArgives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord of the\nearthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first\nto wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the staunch Mysians.\nAntilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while Meriones slew Morys and\nHippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and Periphetes. The son of\nAtreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in the flank, and\nthe bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among them;\non this his life came hurrying out of him at the place where he had\nbeen wounded, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus\nkilled more than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to\npursue flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.\n\n\n\nBOOK XV\n\n  Jove awakes, tells Apollo to heal Hector, and the Trojans\n  again become victorious.\n\nBUT when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set\nstakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the Trojans\nmade a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale with fear. Jove\nnow woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned\nJuno by his side, and starting to his feet he saw the Trojans and\nAchaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and the others driving them\npell-mell before them with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector\nlying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping for\nbreath, wandering in mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the\nfeeblest of the Achaeans who struck him.\n\nThe sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno.\n\"I see, Juno,\" said he, \"you mischief-making trickster, that your\ncunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of his\nhost. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be the\nfirst to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not remember\nhow once upon a time I had you hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your\nfeet, and bound your hands in a chain of gold which none might break,\nand you hung in mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were\nin a fury, but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught\nany one of them I gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly\nthreshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did not\nrelieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt about noble\nHercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to\nCos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him, and\nnotwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back again to\nArgos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to leave off being\nso deceitful, and discover how much you are likely to gain by the\nembraces out of which you have come here to trick me.\"\n\nJuno trembled as he spoke, and said, \"May heaven above and earth below\nbe my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx--and this is the\nmost solemn oath that a blessed god can take--nay, I swear also by your\nown almighty head and by our bridal bed--things over which I could\nnever possibly perjure myself--that Neptune is not punishing Hector and\nthe Trojans and helping the Achaeans through any doing of mine; it is\nall of his own mere motion because he was sorry to see the Achaeans\nhard pressed at their ships: if I were advising him, I should tell him\nto do as you bid him.\"\n\nThe sire of gods and men smiled and answered, \"If you, Juno, were\nalways to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune, like\nit or no, would soon come round to your and my way of thinking. If,\nthen, you are speaking the truth and mean what you say, go among the\nrank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and Apollo lord of the bow,\nthat I want them--Iris, that she may go to the Achaean host and tell\nNeptune to leave off fighting and go home, and Apollo, that he may send\nHector again into battle and give him fresh strength; he will thus\nforget his present sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion\ntill they fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will\nthen send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill him\nin front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among them my\nown noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to avenge Patroclus,\nand from that time I will bring it about that the Achaeans shall\npersistently drive the Trojans back till they fulfil the counsels of\nMinerva and take Ilius. But I will not stay my anger, nor permit any\ngod to help the Danaans till I have accomplished the desire of the son\nof Peleus, according to the promise I made by bowing my head on the day\nwhen Thetis touched my knees and besought me to give him honour.\"\n\nJuno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great\nOlympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over vast\ncontinents, and he says to himself, \"Now I will be here, or there,\" and\nhe would have all manner of things--even so swiftly did Juno wing her\nway till she came to high Olympus and went in among the gods who were\ngathered in the house of Jove. When they saw her they all of them came\nup to her, and held out their cups to her by way of greeting. She let\nthe others be, but took the cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was\nfirst to come running up to her. \"Juno,\" said she, \"why are you here?\nAnd you seem troubled--has your husband the son of Saturn been\nfrightening you?\"\n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what a\nproud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to table,\nwhere you and all the immortals can hear the wicked designs which he\nhas avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal, will be angered by them,\nhowever peaceably he may be feasting now.\"\n\nOn this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the house\nof Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed with care,\nand she spoke up in a rage. \"Fools that we are,\" she cried, \"to be thus\nmadly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to go up to him and stay him\nby force or by persuasion, but he sits aloof and cares for nobody, for\nhe knows that he is much stronger than any other of the immortals. Make\nthe best, therefore, of whatever ills he may choose to send each one of\nyou; Mars, I take it, has had a taste of them already, for his son\nAscalaphus has fallen in battle--the man whom of all others he loved\nmost dearly and whose father he owns himself to be.\"\n\nWhen he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat of\nhis hands, and said in anger, \"Do not blame me, you gods that dwell in\nheaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge the death of my\nson, even though it end in my being struck by Jove's lightning and\nlying in blood and dust among the corpses.\"\n\nAs he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout, while he\nput on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused to still more\nfierce and implacable enmity against the other immortals, had not\nMinerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods, sprung from her seat and\nhurried outside. She tore the helmet from his head and the shield from\nhis shoulders, and she took the bronze spear from his strong hand and\nset it on one side; then she said to Mars, \"Madman, you are undone; you\nhave ears that hear not, or you have lost all judgement and\nunderstanding; have you not heard what Juno has said on coming straight\nfrom the presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through all kinds\nof suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus,\nafter having caused infinite mischief to all us others? Jove would\ninstantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he would come\nto Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one after another, guilty\nor not guilty. Therefore lay aside your anger for the death of your\nson; better men than he have either been killed already or will fall\nhereafter, and one cannot protect every one's whole family.\"\n\nWith these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno called\nApollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods. \"Jove,\" she said\nto them, \"desires you to go to him at once on Mt. Ida; when you have\nseen him you are to do as he may then bid you.\"\n\nThereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris and\nApollo made all haste on their way. When they reached many-fountained\nIda, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove seated on topmost Gargarus\nwith a fragrant cloud encircling his head as with a diadem. They stood\nbefore his presence, and he was pleased with them for having been so\nquick in obeying the orders his wife had given them.\n\nHe spoke to Iris first. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, tell King Neptune\nwhat I now bid you--and tell him true. Bid him leave off fighting, and\neither join the company of the gods, or go down into the sea. If he\ntakes no heed and disobeys me, let him consider well whether he is\nstrong enough to hold his own against me if I attack him. I am older\nand much stronger than he is; yet he is not afraid to set himself up as\non a level with myself, of whom all the other gods stand in awe.\"\n\nIris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or snowflakes\nthat fly from out the clouds before the blast of Boreas, even so did\nshe wing her way till she came close up to the great shaker of the\nearth. Then she said, \"I have come, O dark-haired king that holds the\nworld in his embrace, to bring you a message from Jove. He bids you\nleave off fighting, and either join the company of the gods or go down\ninto the sea; if, however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he\nwill come down here and fight you. He would have you keep out of his\nreach, for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are\nnot afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom all\nthe other gods stand in awe.\"\n\nNeptune was very angry and said, \"Great heavens! strong as Jove may be,\nhe has said more than he can do if he has threatened violence against\nme, who am of like honour with himself. We were three brothers whom\nRhea bore to Saturn--Jove, myself, and Hades who rules the world below.\nHeaven and earth were divided into three parts, and each of us was to\nhave an equal share. When we cast lots, it fell to me to have my\ndwelling in the sea for evermore; Hades took the darkness of the realms\nunder the earth, while air and sky and clouds were the portion that\nfell to Jove; but earth and great Olympus are the common property of\nall. Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me. For all his\nstrength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented without\nthreatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody. Let him keep\nhis bragging talk for his own sons and daughters, who must perforce\nobey him.\"\n\nIris fleet as the wind then answered, \"Am I really, Neptune, to take\nthis daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you reconsider your\nanswer? Sensible people are open to argument, and you know that the\nErinyes always range themselves on the side of the older person.\"\n\nNeptune answered, \"Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in season.\nIt is well when a messenger shows so much discretion. Nevertheless it\ncuts me to the very heart that any one should rebuke so angrily another\nwho is his own peer, and of like empire with himself. Now, however, I\nwill give way in spite of my displeasure; furthermore let me tell you,\nand I mean what I say--if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva\ndriver of the spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep\nIlius, and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking\nit, let him understand that he will incur our implacable resentment.\"\n\nNeptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely did the\nAchaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, \"Go, dear Phoebus, to\nHector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his embrace has now gone\ndown under the sea to avoid the severity of my displeasure. Had he not\ndone so those gods who are below with Saturn would have come to hear of\nthe fight between us. It is better for both of us that he should have\ncurbed his anger and kept out of my reach, for I should have had much\ntrouble with him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it\nfuriously, so as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover,\nbrave Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deeds\nof daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships and to\nthe Hellespont. From that point I will think it well over, how the\nAchaeans may have a respite from their troubles.\"\n\nApollo obeyed his father's saying, and left the crests of Ida, flying\nlike a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He found Hector\nno longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for he had just come\nto himself again. He knew those who were about him, and the sweat and\nhard breathing had left him from the moment when the will of\naegis-bearing Jove had revived him. Apollo stood beside him and said,\n\"Hector son of Priam, why are you so faint, and why are you here away\nfrom the others? Has any mishap befallen you?\"\n\nHector in a weak voice answered, \"And which, kind sir, of the gods are\nyou, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax struck me on the\nchest with a stone as I was killing his comrades at the ships of the\nAchaeans, and compelled me to leave off fighting? I made sure that this\nvery day I should breathe my last and go down into the house of Hades.\"\n\nThen King Apollo said to him, \"Take heart; the son of Saturn has sent\nyou a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you, even me,\nPhoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been guardian hitherto not\nonly of yourself but of your city. Now, therefore, order your horsemen\nto drive their chariots to the ships in great multitudes. I will go\nbefore your horses to smooth the way for them, and will turn the\nAchaeans in flight.\"\n\nAs he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his people.\nAnd as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and gallops\ngloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont to take his\nbath in the river--he tosses his head, and his mane streams over his\nshoulders as in all the pride of his strength he flies full speed to\nthe pastures where the mares are feeding--even so Hector, when he heard\nwhat the god said, urged his horsemen on, and sped forward as fast as\nhis limbs could take him. As country peasants set their hounds on to a\nhomed stag or wild goat--he has taken shelter under rock or thicket,\nand they cannot find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts\nhave roused stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for\nthe chase--even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body, using\ntheir swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they saw Hector\ngoing about among his men they were afraid, and their hearts fell down\ninto their feet.\n\nThen spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man who\ncould throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close fight,\nwhile few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided. He\nthen with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: \"What, in\nheaven's name, do I now see? Is it not Hector come to life again? Every\none made sure he had been killed by Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems\nthat one of the gods has again rescued him. He has killed many of us\nDanaans already, and I take it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove\nmust be with him or he would never dare show himself so masterful in\nthe forefront of the battle. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say;\nlet us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships,\nbut let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand\nfirm, and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our\nspears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then think\nbetter of it before he tries to charge into the press of the Danaans.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who were\nabout Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of Teucer,\nMeriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best men about them\nand sustained the fight against Hector and the Trojans, but the main\nbody fell back upon the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nThe Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding on at\ntheir head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in cloud about his\nshoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with its shaggy fringe,\nwhich Vulcan the smith had given Jove to strike terror into the hearts\nof men. With this in his hand he led on the Trojans.\n\nThe Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of battle\nrose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the bowstrings.\nMany a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies of many\na valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they could\ntaste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. So long as\nPhoebus Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the\nweapons on either side took effect and the people fell, but when he\nshook it straight in the face of the Danaans and raised his mighty\nbattle-cry their hearts fainted within them and they forgot their\nformer prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on\na herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not\nthere--even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo filled them\nwith panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.\n\nThe fight then became more scattered and they killed one another where\nthey best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the one, leader\nof the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade of Menestheus.\nAeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was bastard son to Oileus, and\nbrother to Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own country, for\nhe had killed a man, a kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus\nhad married. Iasus had become a leader of the Athenians, and was son of\nSphelus the son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites\nEchius, in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris\nstruck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as he\nwas flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went clean\nthrough him.\n\nWhile they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the Achaeans\nwere flying pell-mell to the trench and the set stakes, and were forced\nback within their wall. Hector then cried out to the Trojans, \"Forward\nto the ships, and let the spoils be. If I see any man keeping back on\nthe other side the wall away from the ships I will have him killed: his\nkinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire, but dogs\nshall tear him in pieces in front of our city.\"\n\nAs he spoke he laid his whip about his horses' shoulders and called to\nthe Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted with a cry that\nrent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck with his own. Phoebus\nApollo went before, and kicked down the banks of the deep trench into\nits middle so as to make a great broad bridge, as broad as the throw of\na spear when a man is trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured\nover the bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He\nkicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who playing\non the sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks it down again\nand destroys it--even so did you, O Apollo, shed toil and trouble upon\nthe Argives, filling them with panic and confusion.\n\nThus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out to\none another and raising their hands with loud cries every man to\nheaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, lifted up\nhis hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed more fervently\nthan any of them. \"Father Jove,\" said he, \"if ever any one in\nwheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of sheep or heifer and\nprayed that he might return safely home, whereon you bowed your head to\nhim in assent, bear it in mind now, and suffer not the Trojans to\ntriumph thus over the Achaeans.\"\n\nAll-counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of the\naged son of Neleus. When they heard Jove thunder they flung themselves\nyet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking over the bulwarks\nof a ship when the sea runs high before a gale--for it is the force of\nthe wind that makes the waves so great--even so did the Trojans spring\nover the wall with a shout, and drive their chariots onwards. The two\nsides fought with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand\nencounter-the Trojans from their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up\ninto their ships and wielding the long pikes that were lying on the\ndecks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze.\n\nNow Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting about\nthe wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships, remained sitting\nin the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him with his conversation\nand spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When, however, he\nsaw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while the\nAchaeans were clamouring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and\nsmote his two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"Eurypylus,\" said he\nin his dismay, \"I know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you\nany longer, for there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take\ncare of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him\nto fight if I can; who knows but with heaven's help I may persuade him.\nA man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm and\nresisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were fewer in\nnumber, they could not drive them back from the ships, neither could\nthe Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their way in among the\ntents and ships. As a carpenter's line gives a true edge to a piece of\nship's timber, in the hand of some skilled workman whom Minerva has\ninstructed in all kinds of useful arts--even so level was the issue of\nthe fight between the two sides, as they fought some round one and some\nround another.\n\nHector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about the\nsame ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the ship, nor yet\ncould Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which heaven had brought him.\n\nThen Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear as he\nwas bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the ground and\nthe torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his cousin fallen in\nfront of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\n\"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot,\nbut rescue the son of Clytius lest the Achaeans strip him of his armour\nnow that he has fallen.\"\n\nHe then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit Lycophron a\nfollower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was living with Ajax\ninasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hector's spear\nstruck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the\nship's prow on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with\nrage and said to his brother, \"Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty\ncomrade the son of Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from\nCythera and whom we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has\njust killed him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which\nPhoebus Apollo gave you.\"\n\nTeucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver in\nhis hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans, and hit\nCleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son of\nPanthous, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his\nhorses; he was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight,\ndoing good service to Hector and the Trojans, but evil had now come\nupon him, and not one of those who were fain to do so could avert it,\nfor the arrow struck him on the back of the neck. He fell from his\nchariot and his horses shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King\nPolydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come up to the\nhorses; he gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and ordered\nhim to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went back\nand took his place in the front ranks.\n\nTeucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have been no\nmore fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed him then and\nthere: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector, had his eyes on\nTeucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for\nhim just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim; on this the\narrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands. Teucer shook with\nanger and said to his brother, \"Alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all\nwe do; it has broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand,\nthough I strung it this selfsame morning that it might serve me for\nmany an arrow.\"\n\nAjax son of Telamon answered, \"My good fellow, let your bow and your\narrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite the\nDanaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both\nfight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be\nsuccessful for the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it\na hard matter to take the ships.\"\n\nTeucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a shield\nfour hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set his\nhelmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\nabove it; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith\nhe was by the side of Ajax.\n\nWhen Hector saw that Teucer's bow was of no more use to him, he shouted\nout to the Trojans and Lycians, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good\nin close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle here at the\nships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless by\nthe hand of Jove. It is easy to see when Jove is helping people and\nmeans to help them still further, or again when he is bringing them\ndown and will do nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is going\nagainst the Argives. Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any\nof you is struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he\ndies with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave\nhis wife and children safe behind him, with his house and allotment\nunplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to their own land,\nthey and their ships.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the other\nside exhorted his comrades saying, \"Shame on you Argives, we are now\nutterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy from\nour ships. Do you think, if Hector takes them, that you will be able to\nget home by land? Can you not hear him cheering on his whole host to\nfire our fleet, and bidding them remember that they are not at a dance\nbut in battle? Our only course is to fight them with might and main; we\nhad better chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and\nwithout issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.\"\n\nWith these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then killed\nSchedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and Ajax killed\nLaodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor. Polydamas killed\nOtus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of the proud\nEpeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas crouched\ndown, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of\nPanthous to fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of\nhis chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped\nhim of his armour. At that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of\nLampus sprang upon Lampus was son of Laomedon and noted for his valour,\nwhile his son Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck\nthe middle of the son of Phyleus' shield with his spear, setting on him\nat close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of metal saved\nhim; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river Selleis, where\nhis host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect\nhim. It now served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the\ntopmost crest of Dolops's bronze helmet with his spear and tore away\nits plume of horse-hair, so that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was\nit tumbled down into the dust. While he was still fighting and\nconfident of victory, Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the\nside of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from\nbehind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his\nchest, whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip\nhim of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for help, and\nhe especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of Hiketaon, who erewhile\nused to pasture his herds of cattle in Percote before the war broke\nout; but when the ships of the Danaans came, he went back to Ilius,\nwhere he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam who\ntreated him as one of his own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said,\n\"Why, Melanippus, are we thus remiss? do you take no note of the death\nof your kinsman, and do you not see how they are trying to take\nDolops's armour? Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives from\na distance now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill\nthem or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.\"\n\nHe led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after.\nMeanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. \"My\nfriends,\" he cried, \"be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves in\nbattle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect each\nother's good opinion are less likely to be killed than those who do\nnot, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.\"\n\nThus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back the\nTrojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as with a\nwall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus of the loud\nbattle-cry urged Antilochus on. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"you are young\nand there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more valiant\nthan you are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill him.\"\n\nHe hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once darted\nout from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking carefully\nround him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the dart did not\nspeed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippus the proud\nson of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward,\nand his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the\nground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a\nhunter has hit as it was breaking away from its covert, and killed it.\nEven so, O Melanippus, did stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip\nyou of your armour; but noble Hector marked him, and came running up to\nhim through the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though\nhe was, would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature\nwhich knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a dog or a\nman who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be gathered to\nattack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and the Trojans and\nHector with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him;\nnor did he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached his\ncomrades.\n\nThe Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the ships\nin fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them on to new\ndeeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the Argives and\ndefeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving glory to\nHector son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships, till he\nhad fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Jove,\ntherefore, bided his time till he should see the glare of a blazing\nship. From that hour he was about so to order that the Trojans should\nbe driven back from the ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans.\nWith this purpose he inspired Hector son of Priam, who was eager enough\nalready, to assail the ships. His fury was as that of Mars, or as when\na fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;\nhe foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible eye-brows,\nand his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with which\nhe fought. Jove from heaven was with him, and though he was but one\nagainst many, vouchsafed him victory and glory; for he was doomed to an\nearly death, and already Pallas Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his\ndestruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept\ntrying to break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them\nthickest, and in the goodliest armour; but do what he might he could\nnot break through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as\nsome high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the\ngale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon them\nlike flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave, raised mountain\nhigh by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep in foam,\nthe fierce winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail\nthem for fear, and they are saved but by a very little from\ndestruction--even so were the hearts of the Achaeans fainting within\nthem. Or as a savage lion attacking a herd of cows while they are\nfeeding by thousands in the low-lying meadows by some wide-watered\nshore--the herdsman is at his wit's end how to protect his herd and\nkeeps going about now in the van and now in the rear of his cattle,\nwhile the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so\nthat they all tremble for fear--even so were the Achaeans utterly\npanic-stricken by Hector and father Jove. Nevertheless Hector only\nkilled Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was wont to\ntake the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty Hercules, but the son was\na far better man than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a\nvaliant warrior, and in understanding ranked among the foremost men of\nMycenae. He it was who then afforded Hector a triumph, for as he was\nturning back he stumbled against the rim of his shield which reached\nhis feet, and served to keep the javelins off him. He tripped against\nthis and fell face upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as\nhe did so. Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a\nspear into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These,\nfor all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves\nterribly afraid of Hector.\n\nThey had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had been\ndrawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans came pouring\nafter them. The Argives were driven back from the first row of ships,\nbut they made a stand by their tents without being broken up and\nscattered; shame and fear restrained them. They kept shouting\nincessantly to one another, and Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to\nthe Achaeans, was loudest in imploring every man by his parents, and\nbeseeching him to stand firm.\n\n\"Be men, my friends,\" he cried, \"and respect one another's good\nopinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your\nproperty, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On their\nbehalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand firm, and not\nto turn in flight.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva lifted\nthe thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon\nthem, alike on the side of the ships and on that where the fight was\nraging. They could see Hector and all his men, both those in the rear\nwho were taking no part in the battle, and those who were fighting by\nthe ships.\n\nAjax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but strode\nfrom deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands twelve cubits long\nand jointed with rings. As a man skilled in feats of horsemanship\ncouples four horses together and comes tearing full speed along the\npublic way from the country into some large town--many both men and\nwomen marvel as they see him for he keeps all the time changing his\nhorse, springing from one to another without ever missing his feet\nwhile the horses are at a gallop--even so did Ajax go striding from one\nship's deck to another, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept\non shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to defend\ntheir ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the main body\nof the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon a flock of\nwild-fowl feeding near a river--geese, it may be, or cranes, or\nlong-necked swans--even so did Hector make straight for a dark-prowed\nship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his mighty hand impelled\nhim forward, and roused his people to follow him.\n\nAnd now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would have\nthought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so fiercely did\nthey fight; and this was the mind in which they were--the Achaeans did\nnot believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\ndoomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with the\nhope of firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the sword.\n\nThus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of the\ngood ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never bore him back\nto his native land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand\nfight between Danaans and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance\nwith bows and javelins, but with one mind hacked at one another in\nclose combat with their mighty swords and spears pointed at both ends;\nthey fought moreover with keen battle-axes and with hatchets. Many a\ngood stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or\nshoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when\nhe had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on to its\ncurved stern and shouted to the Trojans, \"Bring fire, and raise the\nbattle-cry all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a\nday that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the ships\nwhich came hither against heaven's will, and which have caused us such\ninfinite suffering through the cowardice of our councillors, who when I\nwould have done battle at the ships held me back and forbade the host\nto follow me; if Jove did then indeed warp our judgements, himself now\ncommands me and cheers me on.\"\n\nAs he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the Achaeans,\nand Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome by the darts\nthat were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed. Therefore he\nleft the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the\nseven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and\nwith his spear held back any Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the\nships. All the time he kept on shouting at the top of his voice and\nexhorting the Danaans. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"Danaan heroes, servants\nof Mars, be men my friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we\nhope to find helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than\nthe one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may\ndraw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the plain\nof the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from our own\ncountry. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our hands and in\nhard fighting.\"\n\nAs he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and when any\nTrojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector's bidding, he would\nbe on the look-out for him, and drive at him with his long spear.\nTwelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand fight before the ships.\n\n\n\nBOOK XVI\n\n  Fire being now thrown on the ship of Protesilaus, Patroclus\n  fights in the armour of Achilles--He drives the Trojans back,\n  but is in the end killed by Euphorbus and Hector.\n\nTHUS did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus drew\nnear to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from some spring\nwhose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high precipice. When\nAchilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said, \"Why,\nPatroclus, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that comes\nrunning to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried--she catches\nhold of her mother's dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, and\nlooks tearfully up until her mother carries her--even such tears,\nPatroclus, are you now shedding. Have you anything to say to the\nMyrmidons or to myself? or have you had news from Phthia which you\nalone know? They tell me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive, as also\nPeleus son of Aeacus, among the Myrmidons--men whose loss we two should\nbitterly deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in\nwhich they are being killed at the ships, through their own high-handed\ndoings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me that both of us may\nknow about it.\"\n\nThen, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered, \"Achilles, son\nof Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do not be angry, but I\nweep for the disaster that has now befallen the Argives. All those who\nhave been their champions so far are lying at the ships, wounded by\nsword or spear. Brave Diomed son of Tydeus has been hit with a spear,\nwhile famed Ulysses and Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylus\nagain has been struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries\nare attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are\nyou still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my lot to nurse\nsuch a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own good name.\nWho in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the\nArgives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus was not your father\nnor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore you and the sheer cliffs\nbegot you, so cruel and remorseless are you. If however you are kept\nback through knowledge of some oracle, or if your mother Thetis has\ntold you something from the mouth of Jove, at least send me and the\nMyrmidons with me, if I may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me\nmoreover wear your armour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and\nquit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have\nbreathing time--which while they are fighting may hardly be. We who are\nfresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and tents to their\nown city.\"\n\nHe knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own\ndestruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"What, noble\nPatroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding,\nnor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Jove, but I am cut\nto the very heart that one of my own rank should dare to rob me because\nhe is more powerful than I am. This, after all that I have gone\nthrough, is more than I can endure. The girl whom the sons of the\nAchaeans chose for me, whom I won as the fruit of my spear on having\nsacked a city--her has King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were\nsome common vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man may keep his\nanger for ever; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of\nwar had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armour about\nyour shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark cloud of\nTrojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the Argives are driven back\non to the beach, cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people of\nTroy has taken heart to sally out against them, because they see not\nthe visor of my helmet gleaming near them. Had they seen this, there\nwould not have been a creek nor grip that had not been filled with\ntheir dead as they fled back again. And so it would have been, if only\nKing Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset\nour host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to defend the\nDanaans, neither have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus coming\nfrom his hated head, whereas that of murderous Hector rings in my cars\nas he gives orders to the Trojans, who triumph over the Achaeans and\nfill the whole plain with their cry of battle. But even so, Patroclus,\nfall upon them and save the fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent\nus from being able to return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you\nmay win me great honour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore\nthe girl to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you\nhave driven the Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though Juno's\nthundering husband should put triumph within your reach, do not fight\nthe Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob me of glory that\nshould be mine. And do not for lust of battle go on killing the Trojans\nnor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest one of the ever-living gods\nfrom Olympus attack you--for Phoebus Apollo loves them well: return\nwhen you have freed the ships from peril, and let others wage war upon\nthe plain. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a\nsingle man of all the Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the\nArgives, but that we two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle\nthat veils the brow of Troy.\"\n\nThus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground for\nthe shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove and the\njavelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet that gleamed\nabout his temples rang with the continuous clatter of the missiles that\nkept pouring on to it and on to the cheek-pieces that protected his\nface. Moreover his left shoulder was tired with having held his shield\nso long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would, they could not\nmake him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained\nfrom every pore of his body, he had not a moment's respite, and on all\nsides he was beset by danger upon danger.\n\nAnd now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how fire\nwas thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close up and let\ndrive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean\nin two just behind where the point was fastened on to the shaft of the\nspear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing but a headless spear, while the\nbronze point flew some way off and came ringing down on to the ground.\nAjax knew the hand of heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that\nJove had now left him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for\nthe Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon\nthe ship which was at once wrapped in flame.\n\nThe fire was now flaring about the ship's stern, whereon Achilles smote\nhis two thighs and said to Patroclus, \"Up, noble knight, for I see the\nglare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they destroy our ships,\nand there be no way by which we may retreat. Gird on your armour at\nonce while I call our people together.\"\n\nAs he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his legs with\ngreaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after\nthis he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus, richly inlaid and\nstudded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his\nshoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his\nhelmet, well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly\nabove it. He grasped two redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but\nhe did not take the spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for\nnone other of the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so\neasily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron had\ncut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to deal out\ndeath among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with all speed,\nfor he was the man whom he held in honour next after Achilles, and on\nwhose support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore\nyoked the fleet horses Xanthus and Balius, steeds that could fly like\nthe wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind,\nas she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the river Oceanus. In\nthe side traces he set the noble horse Pedasus, whom Achilles had\nbrought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who,\nmortal steed though he was, could take his place along with those that\nwere immortal.\n\nMeanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and bade his\nMyrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening wolves that are\nfeasting upon a homed stag which they have killed upon the mountains,\nand their jaws are red with blood--they go in a pack to lap water from\nthe clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of blood\nand slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives\nthem--even so did the leaders and counsellors of the Myrmidons gather\nround the good squire of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them\nstood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses.\n\nFifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there was a\ncrew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom he could\ntrust, while he was himself commander over them all. Menesthius of the\ngleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius that streams from heaven,\nwas captain of the first company. Fair Polydora daughter of Peleus bore\nhim to ever-flowing Spercheius--a woman mated with a god--but he was\ncalled son of Borus son of Perieres, with whom his mother was living as\nhis wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to gain her. The second\ncompany was led by noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele,\ndaughter of Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of\nArgos was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at a\ndance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden\narrows; he therefore--Mercury, giver of all good--went with her into an\nupper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble\nson Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When\nIlithuia goddess of the pains of child-birth brought him to the light\nof day, and he saw the face of the sun, mighty Echecles son of Actor\ntook the mother to wife, and gave great wealth to gain her, but her\nfather Phylas brought the child up, and took care of him, doting as\nfondly upon him as though he were his own son. The third company was\nled by Pisander son of Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the\nMyrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroclus. The old knight\nPhoenix was captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of\nLaerceus of the fifth.\n\nWhen Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with their\ncaptains, he charged them straitly saying, \"Myrmidons, remember your\nthreats against the Trojans while you were at the ships in the time of\nmy anger, and you were all complaining of me. 'Cruel son of Peleus,'\nyou would say, 'your mother must have suckled you on gall, so ruthless\nare you. You keep us here at the ships against our will; if you are so\nrelentless it were better we went home over the sea.' Often have you\ngathered and thus chided with me. The hour is now come for those high\nfeats of arms that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep\nhigh hearts each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they serried\ntheir companies yet more closely when they heard the words of their\nking. As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high house\nwhich is to give shelter from the winds--even so closely were the\nhelmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed on\nshield, helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the\nhorse-hair plumes on the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each\nother as they bent their heads.\n\nIn front of them all two men put on their armour--Patroclus and\nAutomedon--two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then\nAchilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest\nwhich silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and\nwhich she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good\nthick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which\nno man but himself might drink, nor would he make offering from it to\nany other god save only to father Jove. He took the cup from the chest\nand cleansed it with sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and\nafter he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle\nof the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his\ndrink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in\nthunder. \"King Jove,\" he cried, \"lord of Dodona, god of the Pelasgi,\nwho dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your sway, where your\nprophets the Selli dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their\ncouches made upon the ground--if you heard me when I prayed to you\naforetime, and did me honour while you sent disaster on the Achaeans,\nvouchsafe me now the fulfilment of yet this further prayer. I shall\nstay here where my ships are lying, but I shall send my comrade into\nbattle at the head of many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that\nvictory may go with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector\nmay learn whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether\nhis might is only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil\nof war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of battle\nfrom the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with his armour and\nhis comrades, fighters in close combat.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part of it\nhe did indeed vouchsafe him--but not the whole. He granted that\nPatroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships, but refused\nto let him come safely out of the fight.\n\nWhen he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles went\ninside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.\n\nThen he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the fierce\nfight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.\n\nMeanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till they\nsprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out like wasps\nwhose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly children love to tease,\nwhereon any one who happens to be passing may get stung--or again, if a\nwayfarer going along the road vexes them by accident, every wasp will\ncome flying out in a fury to defend his little ones--even with such\nrage and courage did the Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their\ncry of battle rose heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his men at the\ntop of his voice, \"Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be\nmen my friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win glory\nfor the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships of the\nArgives--he, and his close fighting followers. The son of Atreus King\nAgamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no respect to the\nbravest of the Achaeans.\"\n\nWith these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they fell in\na body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the cry which the\nAchaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave son of Menoetius\nand his squire all gleaming in their armour, they were daunted and\ntheir battalions were thrown into confusion, for they thought the fleet\nson of Peleus must now have put aside his anger, and have been\nreconciled to Agamemnon; every one, therefore, looked round about to\nsee whither he might fly for safety.\n\nPatroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where men\nwere packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of Protesilaus. He\nhit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the Amydon and\nthe broad waters of the river Axius; the spear struck him on the right\nshoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on this his\nmen were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who was\nthe finest soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into them all. He\nthus drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then\nblazing--leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The Trojans\nwere now driven back with a shout that rent the skies, while the\nDanaans poured after them from their ships, shouting also without\nceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the thunder-cloud, spreads a dense\ncanopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and all the peaks, the\njutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great light that\nflashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had now\ndriven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a little\nwhile; but the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were\nnot driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted\nfrom their ground only by sheer fighting.\n\nThe fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed one\nanother when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius first\ndrove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was turning\nround; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he fell\nforward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the chest, where it was\nexposed near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of\nPhyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him, and ere he could do so took\naim at the upper part of his thigh, where the muscles are thicker than\nin any other part; the spear tore through all the sinews of the leg,\nand his eyes were closed in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor one,\nAntilochus, speared Atymnius, driving the point of the spear through\nhis throat, and down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus in\nhand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear\nin hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment\nhad struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his aim was\ntrue, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm, and\ntore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily to the ground and\nhis eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades of\nSarpedon go down to Erebus slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were\nthe warrior sons of Amisodorus, who had reared the invincible Chimaera,\nto the bane of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took\nhim alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then and\nthere by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his blood,\nwhile dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him and closed his\neyes.\n\nPeneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed each\nother with their spears. They had both thrown without effect, so now\nthey drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed crest of Peneleos'\nhelmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lycon on\nthe neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was held\non by nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him.\nMeriones gave chase to Acamas on foot and caught him up just as he was\nabout to mount his chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulder\nso that he fell headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in\ndarkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the bronze point of\nthe spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among\nthe white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were all of them\nknocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his eyes;\nit also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and the darkness\nof death enfolded him round about.\n\nThus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his man. As\nravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them when they are\nalone on the hillsides and have strayed from the main flock through the\ncarelessness of the shepherd--and when the wolves see this they pounce\nupon them at once because they cannot defend themselves--even so did\nthe Danaans now fall on the Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in\ntheir panic and had no more fight left in them.\n\nMeanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector, but\nHector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well under cover\nof his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the whizzing of the\narrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well knew that the fortunes\nof the day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried to protect\nhis comrades.\n\nAs when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a clear\nsky when Jove is brewing a gale--even with such panic stricken rout did\nthe Trojans now fly, and there was no order in their going. Hector's\nfleet horses bore him and his armour out of the fight, and he left the\nTrojan host penned in by the deep trench against their will. Many a\nyoke of horses snapped the pole of their chariots in the trench and\nleft their master's car behind them. Patroclus gave chase, calling\nimpetuously on the Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who,\nbeing now no longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of\npanic and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust they\nraised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from the\ntents and ships towards the city.\n\nPatroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men flying in\nconfusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were being smashed\nin all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from his own car\nto fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroclus, whose immortal steeds,\ngiven by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as they\nsped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set\nhis heart on spearing him, but Hector's horses were now hurrying him\naway. As the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day\nwhen Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked judgement\nin their courts, and driving justice therefrom without heed to the\ndecrees of heaven--all the rivers run full and the torrents tear many a\nnew channel as they roar headlong from the mountains to the dark sea,\nand it fares ill with the works of men--even such was the stress and\nstrain of the Trojan horses in their flight.\n\nPatroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and drove\nthem back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach the city,\nbut he would not let them, and bore down on them between the river and\nthe ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. First he\nhit Pronous with a spear on the chest where it was exposed near the rim\nof his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on\nThestor son of Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot,\nfor he had lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.\nPatroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he thus\nhooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the rim of his\ncar, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock and draws a strong\nfish out of the sea with a hook and a line--even so with his spear did\nhe pull Thestor all gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down on\nhis face and he died while falling. On this, as Erylaus was on coming\nto attack him, he struck him full on the head with a stone, and his\nbrains were all battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to\nthe ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him. Then he laid low,\none after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, Epaltes, Tlepolemus, Echius\nson of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippus and Polymelus son of Argeas.\n\nNow when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled tunics,\nbeing overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked the Lycians\nsaying. \"Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show your mettle; I\nwill myself meet this man in fight and learn who it is that is so\nmasterful; he has done us much hurt, and has stretched many a brave man\nupon the ground.\"\n\nHe sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he saw\nthis, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at one another\nwith loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned vultures that scream\nand tear at one another in some high mountain fastness.\n\nThe son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said to\nJuno who was his wife and sister, \"Alas, that it should be the lot of\nSarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of Patroclus. I am\nin two minds whether to catch him up out of the fight and set him down\nsafe and sound in the fertile land of Lycia, or to let him now fall by\nthe hand of the son of Menoetius.\"\n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that you are\nsaying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has long been fated,\nout of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we shall not all of us be\nof your mind. I say further, and lay my saying to your heart, that if\nyou send Sarpedon safely to his own home, some other of the gods will\nbe also wanting to escort his son out of battle, for there are many\nsons of gods fighting round the city of Troy, and you will make every\none jealous. If, however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him\nindeed fall by the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone\nout of him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field and\ntake him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his brothers and his\nkinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the dead.\"\n\nThe sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood upon the\nearth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to kill on the rich\nplain of Troy far from his home.\n\nWhen they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck\nThrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of the\nbelly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroclus and\nmissed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the right shoulder, and\nit screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the dust until the life went\nout of it. The other two horses began to plunge; the pole of the\nchariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins through the fall of\nthe horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon knew what to\ndo; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung by\nhis sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two\nrighted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together\ninto battle.\n\nSarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed him, the\npoint of the spear passed over his left shoulder without hitting him.\nPatroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not from his hand\nin vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the\never-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall pine\nto which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber\nfor ship-building--even so did he lie stretched at full length in front\nof his chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained\ndust. As when a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and\nfastens on a great black bull which dies bellowing in its\nclutches--even so did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle in\ndeath as he fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty\ncomrade and said, \"Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth\nall your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit yourself\nlike a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian captains and\nbid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save my\narmour from being taken. My name will haunt you henceforth and for ever\nif the Achaeans rob me of my armour now that I have fallen at their\nships. Do your very utmost and call all my people together.\"\n\nDeath closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on his\nbreast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses came out\nalong with it, and he drew out both spear-point and Sarpedon's soul at\nthe same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his snorting steeds, who were\nwild with panic at finding themselves deserted by their lords.\n\nGlaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said, for\nhe could not help him. He had to support his arm with his other hand,\nbeing in great pain through the wound which Teucer's arrow had given\nhim when Teucer was defending the wall as he, Glaucus, was assailing\nit. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo saying, \"Hear me O king\nfrom your seat, may be in the rich land of Lycia, or may be in Troy,\nfor in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is in distress, as\nI now am. I have a grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there\nis no staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my\nhurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and fight\nthem, though our prince, Jove's son Sarpedon, is slain. Jove defended\nnot his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease my\npain and grant me strength both to cheer on the Lycians and to fight\nalong with them round the body of him who has fallen.\"\n\nThus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,\nstaunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new strength.\nGlaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had\nanswered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian\ncaptains, and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From\nthese he strode on among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthous and\nAgenor; he then went in search of Aeneas and Hector, and when he had\nfound them he said, \"Hector, you have utterly forgotten your allies,\nwho languish here for your sake far from friends and home while you do\nnothing to support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\nfallen--he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has laid\nhim low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends, and suffer\nnot the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to treat his body\nwith contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom we have speared at\nthe ships.\"\n\nAs he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable grief;\nfor Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the main stays of\ntheir city, both as having much people with him, and himself the\nforemost among them all. Led by Hector, who was infuriated by the fall\nof Sarpedon, they made instantly for the Danaans with all their might,\nwhile the undaunted spirit of Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the\nAchaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding.\n\"Ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show yourselves the men\nyou have always been, or even better--Sarpedon is fallen--he who was\nfirst to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body and\noutrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill his\ncomrades if they try to rescue his body.\"\n\nHe spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,\ntherefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the Myrmidons\nand Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought\ndesperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while.\nMighty was the din of their armour as they came together, and Jove shed\na thick darkness over the fight, to increase the toil of the battle\nover the body of his son.\n\nAt first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for one of\nthe best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son of noble\nAgacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Budeum; but\npresently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge\nwith Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius the land of noble steeds\nto fight the Trojans under Achilles. Hector now struck him on the head\nwith a stone just as he had caught hold of the body, and his brains\ninside his helmet were all battered in, so that he fell face foremost\nupon the body of Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the\ndeath of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a\nhawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly,\nO noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for the Lycians and\nTrojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck Sthenelaus the son\nof Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons that join\nit to the head and spine. On this Hector and the front rank of his men\ngave ground. As far as a man can throw a javelin when competing for\nsome prize, or even in battle--so far did the Trojans now retreat\nbefore the Achaeans. Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to\nrally them, by killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and\nwas the richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly,\njust as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him,\nand drove his spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell\nheavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the\nAchaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were exultant, and came up in a\nbody round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their\nprowess, bore straight down upon them.\n\nMeriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus son of\nOnetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was honoured by the\npeople as though he were a god. Meriones struck him under the jaw and\near, so that life went out of him and the darkness of death laid hold\nupon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to hit him\nunder the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and\nstooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the\npoint stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till\nMars robbed it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas's\nhand in vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas was angry and\nsaid, \"Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit you my spear\nwould soon have made an end of you.\"\n\nAnd Meriones answered, \"Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will not be\nable to make an end of every one who comes against you. You are only a\nmortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in the middle of your\nshield with my spear, however strong and self-confident you may be, I\nshould soon vanquish you, and you would yield your life to Hades of the\nnoble steeds.\"\n\nOn this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, \"Meriones, hero\nthough you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches, my good\nfriend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead body; some of\nthem must go under ground first; blows for battle, and words for\ncouncil; fight, therefore, and say nothing.\"\n\nHe led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As the\nsound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the mountains--and the\nthud of their axes is heard afar--even such a din now rose from\nearth-clash of bronze armour and of good ox-hide shields, as men smote\neach other with their swords and spears pointed at both ends. A man had\nneed of good eyesight now to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head\nto foot with spears and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as\nflies that buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they are\nbrimming with milk--even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did\nJove turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept\nlooking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill\nPatroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed to end him\nnow in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip him of his\narmour, or whether he should let him give yet further trouble to the\nTrojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire of\nAchilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and the Trojans back towards\nthe city and take the lives of many. First, therefore, he made Hector\nturn fainthearted, whereon he mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the\nother Trojans fly also, for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned\nagainst him. Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were\ndismayed when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap\nof corpses--for when the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many had\nfallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore stripped the gleaming armour\nfrom his shoulders and the brave son of Menoetius gave it to his men to\ntake to the ships. Then Jove lord of the storm-cloud said to Apollo,\n\"Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and take Sarpedon out of range of the\nweapons; cleanse the black blood from off him, and then bear him a long\nway off where you may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia,\nand clothe him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms\nof the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him\nstraightway to the rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and kinsmen\nwill inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to his memory, in\ndue honour to the dead.\"\n\nThus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father's saying, and came down from\nthe heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he took\nSarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a long way off,\nwhere he washed him in the river, anointed him with ambrosia and\nclothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he committed him to the\narms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who presently set\nhim down in the rich land of Lycia.\n\nMeanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to Automedon,\npursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and foolishness of his\nheart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the son of Peleus, he would\nhave escaped death and have been scatheless; but the counsels of Jove\npass man's understanding; he will put even a brave man to flight and\nsnatch victory from his grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as\nhe now did when he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.\n\nWho then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when the\ngods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus, Autonous,\nEcheclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and Melanippus; after these\nhe killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes. These he slew, but the rest\nsaved themselves by flight.\n\nThe sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands of\nPatroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not Phoebus Apollo\ntaken his stand upon the wall to defeat his purpose and to aid the\nTrojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an angle of the high wall, and\nthrice did Apollo beat him back, striking his shield with his own\nimmortal hands. When Patroclus was coming on like a god for yet a\nfourth time, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, \"Draw\nback, noble Patroclus, it is not your lot to sack the city of the\nTrojan chieftains, nor yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far\nbetter man than you are.\" On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to some\ndistance and avoided the anger of Apollo.\n\nMeanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean gates,\nin doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or to call the\narmy inside the gates. As he was thus doubting Phoebus Apollo drew near\nhim in the likeness of a young and lusty warrior Asius, who was\nHector's uncle, being own brother to Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived\nin Phrygia by the waters of the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove's\nson Apollo now spoke to Hector saying, \"Hector, why have you left off\nfighting? It is ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than\nyou, as I am worse, you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight\ntowards Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph over\nhim, and you may rule him.\"\n\nWith this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade\nCebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among them, and\nstruck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to Hector and the\nTrojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and killed no man, but\ndrove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then sprang from his chariot to\nthe ground, with a spear in his left hand, and in his right a jagged\nstone as large as his hand could hold. He stood still and threw it, nor\ndid it go far without hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for\nthe stone struck Cebriones, Hector's charioteer, a bastard son of\nPriam, as he held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the\nforehead and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed,\nand his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped dead from his\nchariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left in\nhim. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight Patroclus, saying, \"Bless my\nheart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we had been at sea\nthis fellow would have dived from the ship's side and brought up as\nmany oysters as the whole crew could stomach, even in rough water, for\nhe has dived beautifully off his chariot on to the ground. It seems,\nthen, that there are divers also among the Trojans.\"\n\nAs he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it were,\nof a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself struck in the\nchest, and his courage is his own bane--even so furiously, O Patroclus,\ndid you then spring upon Cebriones. Hector sprang also from his chariot\nto the ground. The pair then fought over the body of Cebriones. As two\nlions fight fiercely on some high mountain over the body of a stag that\nthey have killed, even so did these two mighty warriors, Patroclus son\nof Menoetius and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the\ncorpse of Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got\nhim by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a\nfierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the east\nand south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some dense forest\non the mountains--there is beech and ash and spreading cornel; the top\nof the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one can hear the\nboughs cracking and breaking--even so did the Trojans and Achaeans\nspring upon one another and lay about each other, and neither side\nwould give way. Many a pointed spear fell to ground and many a winged\narrow sped from its bow-string about the body of Cebriones; many a\ngreat stone, moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his\nbody, but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and\nhugely, heedless of his driving now.\n\nSo long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of either\nside were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he went down\ntowards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to be\nbeyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Cebriones out of range\nof the darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armour from\nhis shoulders. Then Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a\nterrific shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but\nas he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was the\nhour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell earnest.\nPatroclus did not see him as he moved about in the crush, for he was\nenshrouded in thick darkness, and the god struck him from behind on his\nback and his broad shoulders with the flat of his hand, so that his\neyes turned dizzy. Phoebus Apollo beat the helmet from off his head,\nand it rolled rattling off under the horses' feet, where its horse-hair\nplumes were all begrimed with dust and blood. Never indeed had that\nhelmet fared so before, for it had served to protect the head and\ncomely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however, Zeus\ndelivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of Hector\nalso was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, was\nbroken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield that covered him from\nhead to foot fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, and\nApollo undid the fastenings of his corslet.\n\nOn this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he stood as\none dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a Dardanian, the best\nspearman of his time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner,\ncame behind him and struck him in the back with a spear, midway between\nthe shoulders. This man as soon as ever he had come up with his chariot\nhad dismounted twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of\nwar--he it was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you,\nbut he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into the\ncrowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would not\nstand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was, to attack\nhim; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god had given him\nand by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for\nhis life. Hector on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground,\nforced his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him\nin the lower part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point\nright through it, so that he fell heavily to the ground to the great\ngrief of the Achaeans. As when a lion has fought some fierce wild-boar\nand worsted him--the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some\nlittle fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten\nthe boar till he can hardly breathe--even so did Hector son of Priam\ntake the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed so many,\nstriking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while.\n\"Patroclus,\" said he, \"you deemed that you should sack our city, rob\nour Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to\nyour own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet horses were ever straining\ntheir utmost to defend them. I am foremost of all the Trojan warriors\nto stave the day of bondage from off them; as for you, vultures shall\ndevour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you\nnothing; and yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly\nsaying, 'Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have\nrent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.' Thus I\nween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered him 'yea' within\nyou.\"\n\nThen, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight Patroclus:\n\"Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn and Apollo have\nvouchsafed you victory; it is they who have vanquished me so easily,\nand they who have stripped the armour from my shoulders; had twenty\nsuch men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my\nspear. Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal\nmen Euphorbus; you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say\nfurther, and lay my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a\nlittle season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and\nthey will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul left\nhis body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning its sad fate\nand bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its manhood. Dead though\nhe was, Hector still spoke to him saying, \"Patroclus, why should you\nthus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\nmay be smitten by my spear and die before me?\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his foot\nupon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back. He then\nwent spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet descendant of\nAeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the immortal steeds which the\ngods had given as a rich gift to Peleus bore him swiftly from the field.\n\n\n\nBOOK XVII\n\n  The fight around the body of Patroclus.\n\nBRAVE Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had\nfallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full armour to\nbestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so did\nyellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He held his round shield and\nhis spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should dare face\nhim. But the son of Panthous had also noted the body, and came up to\nMenelaus saying, \"Menelaus, son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body,\nand let the bloodstained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans and\ntheir brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,\nhave my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill you.\"\n\nTo this Menelaus answered in great anger \"By father Jove, boasting is\nan ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion nor savage\nwild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures, than\nare the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days\nof his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me the\nmeanest soldier among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to\ngladden his wife and parents. Even so shall I make an end of you too,\nif you withstand me; get you back into the crowd and do not face me, or\nit shall be worse for you. Even a fool may be wise after the event.\"\n\nEuphorbus would not listen, and said, \"Now indeed, Menelaus, shall you\npay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted, and whose wife\nyou widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought grief unspeakable\non his parents. I shall comfort these poor people if I bring your head\nand armour and place them in the hands of Panthous and noble Phrontis.\nThe time is come when this matter shall be fought out and settled, for\nme or against me.\"\n\nAs he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear did\nnot go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus then took\naim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was drawing back,\nand Menelaus struck him about the roots of his throat, leaning his\nwhole weight on the spear, so as to drive it home. The point went clean\nthrough his neck, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell\nheavily to the ground. His hair which was like that of the Graces, and\nhis locks so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold, were all\nbedrabbled with blood. As one who has grown a fine young olive tree in\na clear space where there is abundance of water--the plant is full of\npromise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts\nforth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce hurricane sweep\ndown upon it and level it with the ground--even so did Menelaus strip\nthe fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he had slain him. Or as\nsome fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of his strength\nfastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding--first he\nbreaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then gorges on her blood and\nentrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against him, but they\nstand aloof and will not come close to him, for they are pale with\nfear--even so no one had the courage to face valiant Menelaus. The son\nof Atreus would have then carried off the armour of the son of Panthous\nwith ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of\nMentes chief of the Cicons incited Hector to attack him. \"Hector,\" said\nhe, \"you are now going after the horses of the noble son of Aeacus, but\nyou will not take them; they cannot be kept in hand and driven by\nmortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son to an immortal mother.\nMeanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden the body of Patroclus\nand killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbus son of Panthous, so\nthat he can fight no more.\"\n\nThe god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of\nHector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the ranks\nand saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still flowing from\nhis wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour. On this he made\nhis way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming armour,\nand crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard him, he said\nto himself in his dismay, \"Alas! what shall I do? I may not let the\nTrojans take the armour of Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my\nbehalf, lest some Danaan who sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if\nfor my honour's sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed, they\nwill prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force.\nWhy, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in despite of\nheaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue it. Let no\nDanaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for the hand of\nheaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the two of us would\nfight Hector and heaven too, if we might only save the body of\nPatroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of many evils would be the\nleast.\"\n\nWhile he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with Hector\nat their head; he therefore drew back and left the body, turning about\nlike some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men from a\nstockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks\nsulkily off--even so did Menelaus son of Atreus turn and leave the body\nof Patroclus. When among the body of his men, he looked around for\nmighty Ajax son of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme left\nof the fight, cheering on his men and exhorting them to keep on\nfighting, for Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic among them. He\nran up to him and said, \"Ajax, my good friend, come with me at once to\ndead Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles--as for\nhis armour, Hector already has it.\"\n\nThese words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among the\nfront ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped Patroclus of\nhis armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his head and take the\nbody to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax came up with his shield\nlike wall before him, on which Hector withdrew under shelter of his\nmen, and sprang on to his chariot, giving the armour over to the\nTrojans to take to the city, as a great trophy for himself; Ajax,\ntherefore, covered the body of Patroclus with his broad shield and\nbestrode him; as a lion stands over his whelps if hunters have come\nupon him in a forest when he is with his little ones--in the pride and\nfierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover\nhis eyes--even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and by his\nside stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in his heart.\n\nThen Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and rebuked\nhim sternly. \"Hector,\" said he, \"you make a brave show, but in fight\nyou are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has no claim to so great\na reputation. Think how you may now save your town and citadel by the\nhands of your own people born in Ilius; for you will get no Lycians to\nfight for you, seeing what thanks they have had for their incessant\nhardships. Are you likely, sir, to do anything to help a man of less\nnote, after leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in\narms, to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived he\ndid good service both to your city and yourself; yet you had no stomach\nto save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will listen to me, they\nwill go home and leave Troy to its fate. If the Trojans had any of that\ndaring fearless spirit which lays hold of men who are fighting for\ntheir country and harassing those who would attack it, we should soon\nbear off Patroclus into Ilius. Could we get this dead man away and\nbring him into the city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up the\narmour of Sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. For he whose\nsquire has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of the\nAchaeans--he and his close-fighting followers. Nevertheless you dared\nnot make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye, with battle\nall round you, for he is a braver man than you are.\"\n\nHector scowled at him and answered, \"Glaucus, you should know better. I\nhave held you so far as a man of more understanding than any in all\nLycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. I\nfear neither battle nor the din of chariots, but Jove's will is\nstronger than ours; Jove at one time makes even a strong man draw back\nand snatches victory from his grasp, while at another he will set him\non to fight. Come hither then, my friend, stand by me and see indeed\nwhether I shall play the coward the whole day through as you say, or\nwhether I shall not stay some even of the boldest Danaans from fighting\nround the body of Patroclus.\"\n\nAs he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, \"Trojans, Lycians,\nand Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my friends, and fight\nmight and main, while I put on the goodly armour of Achilles, which I\ntook when I killed Patroclus.\"\n\nWith this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men who\nwere taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet got far.\nStanding for a while apart from the woeful fight, he changed his\narmour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius and to the Trojans,\nwhile he put on the immortal armour of the son of Peleus, which the\ngods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son; but the\nson did not grow old in his father's armour.\n\nWhen Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and\narming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his head\nand muttered to himself saying, \"A! poor wretch, you arm in the armour\nof a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing of\nthe doom that is already close upon you. You have killed his comrade so\nbrave and strong, but it was not well that you should strip the armour\nfrom his head and shoulders. I do indeed endow you with great might\nnow, but as against this you shall not return from battle to lay the\narmour of the son of Peleus before Andromache.\"\n\nThe son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted the\narmour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and filled\nhis whole body with might and valour. With a shout he strode in among\nthe allies, and his armour flashed about him so that he seemed to all\nof them like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among them\nand cheered them on--Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus,\nAsteropaeus, Deisenor and Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus the\naugur. All these did he exhort saying, \"Hear me, allies from other\ncities who are here in your thousands, it was not in order to have a\ncrowd about me that I called you hither each from his several city, but\nthat with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones of\nthe Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my people\nwith your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and\ncharge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever\nshall bring Patroclus, dead though he be, into the hands of the\nTrojans, and shall make Ajax give way before him, I will give him one\nhalf of the spoils while I keep the other. He will thus share like\nhonour with myself.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans with\ntheir spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran high that\nhe should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the body--fools that\nthey were, for he was about to take the lives of many. Then Ajax said\nto Menelaus, \"My good friend Menelaus, you and I shall hardly come out\nof this fight alive. I am less concerned for the body of Patroclus, who\nwill shortly become meat for the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for\nthe safety of my own head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a\nstorm of battle from every quarter, and our destruction seems now\ncertain. Call then upon the princes of the Danaans if there is any who\ncan hear us.\"\n\nMenelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at the top\nof his voice. \"My friends,\" he cried, \"princes and counsellors of the\nArgives, all you who with Agamemnon and Menelaus drink at the public\ncost, and give orders each to his own people as Jove vouchsafes him\npower and glory, the fight is so thick about me that I cannot\ndistinguish you severally; come on, therefore, every man unbidden, and\nthink it shame that Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan\nhounds.\"\n\nFleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way\nthrough the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and Meriones\nhis esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others that came into\nthe fight after these, who of his own self could name them?\n\nThe Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a great\nwave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some heaven-born river,\nand the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of the breakers\nthat beat and buffet them--even with such a roar did the Trojans come\non; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son of\nMenoetius, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Jove, moreover,\nhid the brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne\nno grudge against the son of Menoetius while he was still alive and\nsquire to the descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him\nfall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades\non to defend him.\n\nAt first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew from\nthe dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing any one,\nnevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not lose it\nlong, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus\nalike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied them and made towards the\nfront like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay in the\nforest glades and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked\nhim--even so did Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the\nphalanxes of the Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus\nand were most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city.\nAt this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his\nzeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the foot\nthrough the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the sinews\nnear the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none of those\ncould save him who would have gladly done so, for the son of Telamon\nsprang forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed\nheadpiece broke about the point of the weapon, struck at once by the\nspear and by the strong hand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came\noozing out through the crest-socket. His strength then failed him and\nhe let Patroclus' foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead\nupon the body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and\nnever repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his life was\ncut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then took aim at\nAjax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid it;\nthe spear passed on and struck Schedius son of noble Iphitus, captain\nof the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over much\npeople; it struck him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze\npoint went right through him, coming out at the bottom of his\nshoulder-blade, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell\nheavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of\nPhaenops in the middle of the belly as he was bestriding Hippothous,\nand broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his\nentrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth.\nHector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground, while the\nArgives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of\nPhorcys and Hippothous which they stripped presently of their armour.\n\nThe Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and\ndriven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the Argives, so\ngreat was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph\neven against the will of Jove, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in the\nlikeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an attendant who had grown old in\nthe service of Aeneas' aged father, and was at all times devoted to\nhim. In his likeness, then, Apollo said, \"Aeneas, can you not manage,\neven though heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known men,\nwhose numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people in\nspite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give victory\nto us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight instead of being so\nterribly afraid.\"\n\nAeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to\nHector saying, \"Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on us if\nwe are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius through our own\ncowardice. A god has just come up to me and told me that Jove the\nsupreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let us make for the\nDanaans, that it may go hard with them ere they bear away dead\nPatroclus to the ships.\"\n\nAs he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then rallied\nand again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus son of Arisbas,\na valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes was moved with pity as\nhe saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared Apisaon son of\nHippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff, so that\nhe died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best man of them\nall after Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and\nattack the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those\nabout Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their\nspears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders that no\nman was either to give ground, or to stand out before the others, but\nall were to hold well together about the body and fight hand to hand.\nThus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as the\ncorpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of the Trojans and\nallies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last, too, fought no\nbloodless fight though many fewer of them perished, through the care\nthey took to defend and stand by one another.\n\nThus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as though it\nhad gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were hidden over all\nthat part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead son of\nMenoetius, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at their ease\nin full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them, and there was\nnot a cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain. These last\nmoreover would rest for a while and leave off fighting, for they were\nsome distance apart and beyond the range of one another's weapons,\nwhereas those who were in the thick of the fray suffered both from\nbattle and darkness. All the best of them were being worn out by the\ngreat weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, Thrasymedes\nand Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus, and\nbelieved him to be still alive and leading the van against the Trojans;\nthey were keeping themselves in reserve against the death or rout of\ntheir own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent them from\nthe ships into battle.\n\nThus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the sweat\nof their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on their hands\nand eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet son of Peleus. It\nwas as when a man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men,\nand bids them stretch it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug\ntill the moisture leaves it, and the fat soaks in for the many that\npull at it, and it is well stretched--even so did the two sides tug the\ndead body hither and thither within the compass of but a little\nspace--the Trojans steadfastly set on dragging it into Ilius, while the\nAchaeans were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was\nthe fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet\nMinerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a battle.\n\nSuch fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day ordain\nround the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not know that he\nhad fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy a long way off the\nships. He had no idea, therefore, that Patroclus was dead, and deemed\nthat he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to the\ngates. He knew that he was not to sack the city neither with nor\nwithout himself, for his mother had often told him this when he had sat\nalone with her, and she had informed him of the counsels of great Jove.\nNow, however, she had not told him how great a disaster had befallen\nhim in the death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his\ncomrades.\n\nThe others still kept on charging one another round the body with their\npointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say, \"My friends,\nwe can never again show our faces at the ships--better, and greatly\nbetter, that earth should open and swallow us here in this place, than\nthat we should let the Trojans have the triumph of bearing off\nPatroclus to their city.\"\n\nThe Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying, \"Friends,\nthough we fall to a man beside this body, let none shrink from\nfighting.\" With such words did they exhort each other. They fought and\nfought, and an iron clank rose through the void air to the brazen vault\nof heaven. The horses of the descendant of Aeacus stood out of the\nfight and wept when they heard that their driver had been laid low by\nthe hand of murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed\nthem again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and many\na time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back to the ships\nby the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into battle among the\nAchaeans; they stood with their chariot stock still, as a pillar set\nover the tomb of some dead man or woman, and bowed their heads to the\nground. Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned the loss of\ntheir charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet from under the\nyokestraps on either side the yoke.\n\nThe son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He wagged\nhis head, and muttered to himself, saying, \"Poor things, why did we\ngive you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are yourselves\nageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the sorrows that\nbefall mankind? for of all creatures that live and move upon the earth\nthere is none so pitiable as he is--still, Hector son of Priam shall\ndrive neither you nor your chariot. I will not have it. It is enough\nthat he should have the armour over which he vaunts so vainly.\nFurthermore I will give you strength of heart and limb to bear\nAutomedon safely to the ships from battle, for I shall let the Trojans\ntriumph still further, and go on killing till they reach the ships;\nwhereon night shall fall and darkness overshadow the land.\"\n\nAs he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so that they\nshook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their chariot swiftly\ninto the fight that raged between Trojans and Achaeans. Behind them\nfought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid a\nflock of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he dashed\namid the throng of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he\nkilled no man, for he could not wield his spear and keep his horses in\nhand when alone in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alcimedon,\nson of Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his\nchariot. \"Automedon,\" said he, \"what god has put this folly into your\nheart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the Trojans in\nthe front rank single-handed? He who was your comrade is slain, and\nHector plumes himself on being armed in the armour of the descendant of\nAeacus.\"\n\nAutomedon son of Diores answered, \"Alcimedon, there is no one else who\ncan control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you can, save only\nPatroclus--while he was alive--peer of gods in counsel. Take then the\nwhip and reins, while I go down from the car and fight.\"\n\nAlcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and reins,\nwhile Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw him he said to\nAeneas who was near him, \"Aeneas, counsellor of the mail-clad Trojans,\nI see the steeds of the fleet son of Aeacus come into battle with weak\nhands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might take\nthem; they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\"\n\nThe valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair went\nright on, with their shoulders covered under shields of tough dry\nox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus went also with\nthem, and their hearts beat high with hope that they might kill the men\nand capture the horses--fools that they were, for they were not to\nreturn scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to\nfather Jove and was forthwith filled with courage and strength\nabounding. He turned to his trusty comrade Alcimedon and said,\n\"Alcimedon, keep your horses so close up that I may feel their breath\nupon my back; I doubt that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till\nhe has killed us and mounted behind the horses; he will then either\nspread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed\namong the foremost.\"\n\nOn this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, \"Ajaxes captains\nof the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to them that are\nbest able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living; for Hector\nand Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are pressing us\nhard in the full tide of war. Nevertheless the issue lies on the lap of\nheaven, I will therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to Jove.\"\n\nHe poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the round\nshield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield stayed it\nnot, so that it was driven through his belt into the lower part of his\nbelly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow behind\nthe horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so\nthat it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretus give one\nbound and then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till it\nmade an end of him. Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw\nit coming and stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and\nthe point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering\ntill Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have fought hand to\nhand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their way through the\ncrowd when they heard their comrade calling, and parted them for all\ntheir fury--for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius were afraid and drew back,\nleaving Aretus to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon, peer of\nfleet Mars, then stripped him of his armour and vaunted over him\nsaying, \"I have done little to assuage my sorrow for the son of\nMenoetius, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was.\"\n\nAs he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon his\nchariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all steeped in\ngore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.\n\nAnd now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus, for\nMinerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the command of\nfar-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her to encourage the\nDanaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in heaven in token to\nmankind either of war or of the chill storms that stay men from their\nlabour and plague the flocks--even so, wrapped in such radiant raiment,\ndid Minerva go in among the host and speak man by man to each. First\nshe took the form and voice of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus son of\nAtreus, who was standing near her. \"Menelaus,\" said she, \"it will be\nshame and dishonour to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of Achilles\nunder the walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be\nso also.\"\n\nMenelaus answered, \"Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva vouchsafe\nme strength and keep the darts from off me, for so shall I stand by\nPatroclus and defend him; his death has gone to my heart, but Hector is\nas a raging fire and deals his blows without ceasing, for Jove is now\ngranting him a time of triumph.\"\n\nMinerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the other\ngods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and shoulders, and made\nhim as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet come again and\nbite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood--even so bold as\nthis did she make him as he stood over Patroclus and threw his spear.\nNow there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who\nwas both rich and valiant. Hector held him in the highest honour for he\nwas his comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus struck this\nman in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right\nthrough him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus son of\nAtreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his own\npeople.\n\nApollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the\nlikeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the most\nfavoured of all Hector's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, \"Hector,\nwho of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now that you have\nquailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated poorly as a soldier?\nYet he has now got a corpse away from the Trojans single-handed, and\nhas slain your own true comrade, a man brave among the foremost, Podes\nson of Eetion.\"\n\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made his way\nto the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of Saturn seized his\nbright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth his\nlightnings and his thunders, and as he shook his aegis he gave victory\nto the Trojans and routed the Achaeans.\n\nThe panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping his\nface turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear on the\nupper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed the\ntop of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him from\nclose at hand. Then Hector in close combat struck Leitus son of noble\nAlectryon in the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fighting\nfurther. He looked about him in dismay, knowing that never again should\nhe wield spear in battle with the Trojans. While Hector was in pursuit\nof Leitus, Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest near\nthe nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the Trojans cheered\naloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion as he was\nstanding on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the spear\nhit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who had come with\nhim from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot and would have\nafforded a great triumph to the Trojans if Coiranus had not driven\nquickly up to him, he therefore brought life and rescue to Idomeneus,\nbut himself fell by the hand of murderous Hector. For Hector hit him on\nthe jaw under the ear; the end of the spear drove out his teeth and cut\nhis tongue in two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let the\nreins fall to the ground. Meriones gathered them up from the ground and\ntook them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus, \"Lay on, till\nyou get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is no longer\nours.\"\n\nOn this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had taken\nhold upon him.\n\nAjax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour of the\nTrojans, and Ajax was first to speak. \"Alas,\" said he, \"even a fool may\nsee that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All their weapons strike\nhome; no matter whether it be a brave man or a coward that hurls them,\nJove speeds all alike, whereas ours fall each one of them without\neffect. What, then, will be best both as regards rescuing the body, and\nour return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving as they look\nhitherwards; for they will make sure that nothing can now check the\nterrible hands of Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our\nships. I wish that some one would go and tell the son of Peleus at\nonce, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that the\ndearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man among the\nAchaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in\ndarkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons of the\nAchaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will that we\nperish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.\"\n\nFather Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears. Forthwith he\nchased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun shone out and all\nthe fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to Menelaus, \"Look, Menelaus,\nand if Antilochus son of Nestor be still living, send him at once to\ntell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades has\nfallen.\"\n\nMenelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a\nstockyard--the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who keep\nwatch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of\ntheir herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain,\nfor darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt\nhim for all his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away--even\nso did Menelaus sorely against his will leave Patroclus, in great fear\nlest the Achaeans should be driven back in rout and let him fall into\nthe hands of the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes straitly\nsaying, \"Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now indeed\nremember how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive,\nbear it in mind now that he is dead.\"\n\nWith this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an eagle,\nwhose sight they say is keener than that of any other bird--however\nhigh he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape him by\ncrouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it and\nmake an end of it--even so, O Menelaus, did your keen eyes range round\nthe mighty host of your followers to see if you could find the son of\nNestor still alive. Presently Menelaus saw him on the extreme left of\nthe battle cheering on his men and exhorting them to fight boldly.\nMenelaus went up to him and said, \"Antilochus, come here and listen to\nsad news, which I would indeed were untrue. You must see with your own\neyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans, and giving\nvictory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the bravest of\nthe Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run instantly to\nthe ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to rescue the body and\nbear it to the ships. As for the armour, Hector already has it.\"\n\nAntilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was speechless;\nhis eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance, but he did\nas Menelaus had said, and set off running as soon as he had given his\narmour to a comrade, Laodocus, who was wheeling his horses round, close\nbeside him.\n\nThus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad news to\nAchilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded to succour his\nharassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the Pylians--and greatly\ndid they miss him--but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself went\nback to Patroclus. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said, \"I\nhave sent Antilochus to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against\nHector as he may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour.\nWhat then will be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and\nour own escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?\"\n\nAjax answered, \"Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and\nMeriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray, while\nwe two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in heart as in\nname, and long used to fighting side by side with one another.\"\n\nOn this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and\nlifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised a hue\nand cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the body away,\nand flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded boar at the loo of\na band of young huntsmen. For a while the hounds fly at him as though\nthey would tear him in pieces, but now and again he turns on them in a\nfury, scaring and scattering them in all directions--even so did the\nTrojans for a while charge in a body, striking with sword and with\nspears pointed at both the ends, but when the two Ajaxes faced them and\nstood at bay, they would turn pale and no man dared press on to fight\nfurther about the dead.\n\nIn this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the body to\nthe ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them like fierce\nflames that when once kindled spread like wildfire over a city, and the\nhouses fall in the glare of its burning--even such was the roar and\ntramp of men and horses that pursued them as they bore Patroclus from\nthe field. Or as mules that put forth all their strength to draw some\nbeam or great piece of ship's timber down a rough mountain-track, and\nthey pant and sweat as they go--even so did Menelaus and pant and sweat\nas they bore the body of Patroclus. Behind them the two Ajaxes held\nstoutly out. As some wooded mountain-spur that stretches across a plain\nwill turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is there\nany stream strong enough to break through it--even so did the two\nAjaxes face the Trojans and stem the tide of their fighting though they\nkept pouring on towards them and foremost among them all was Aeneas son\nof Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of daws or starlings fall\nto screaming and chattering when they see a falcon, foe to all small\nbirds, come soaring near them, even so did the Achaean youth raise a\nbabel of cries as they fled before Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of\ntheir former prowess. In the rout of the Danaans much goodly armour\nfell round about the trench, and of fighting there was no end.\n\n\n\nBOOK XVIII\n\n  The grief of Achilles over Patroclus--The visit of Thetis\n  to Vulcan and the armour that he made for Achilles.\n\nTHUS then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the fleet\nrunner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached Achilles,\nand found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that which was\nindeed too surely true. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of\nhis heart, \"why are the Achaeans again scouring the plain and flocking\ntowards the ships? Heaven grant the gods be not now bringing that\nsorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis spoke, saying that while I was\nyet alive the bravest of the Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans,\nand see the light of the sun no longer. I fear the brave son of\nMenoetius has fallen through his own daring and yet I bade him return\nto the ships as soon as he had driven back those that were bringing\nfire against them, and not join battle with Hector.\"\n\nAs he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and told his\nsad tale, weeping bitterly the while. \"Alas,\" he cried, \"son of noble\nPeleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that they were untrue.\nPatroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging about his naked body--for\nHector holds his armour.\"\n\nA dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He filled both\nhands with dust from off the ground, and poured it over his head,\ndisfiguring his comely face, and letting the refuse settle over his\nshirt so fair and new. He flung himself down all huge and hugely at\nfull length, and tore his hair with his hands. The bondswomen whom\nAchilles and Patroclus had taken captive screamed aloud for grief,\nbeating their breasts, and with their limbs failing them for sorrow.\nAntilochus bent over him the while, weeping and holding both his hands\nas he lay groaning for he feared that he might plunge a knife into his\nown throat. Then Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him as\nshe was sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,\nwhereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus that\ndwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her. There were\nGlauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, Thoe and dark-eyed Halie,\nCymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera, Amphithoe and Agave, Doto\nand Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene, Dexamene, Amphinome and Callianeira,\nDoris, Panope, and the famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and\nCallianassa. There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa, Maera,\nOreithuia and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who\ndwell in the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their\nmultitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them in\ntheir lament.\n\n\"Listen,\" she cried, \"sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may hear\nthe burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I have borne the\nmost glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and strong, hero among\nheroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended him as a plant in a\ngoodly garden, and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the\nTrojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So\nlong as he lives to look upon the light of the sun he is in heaviness,\nand though I go to him I cannot help him. Nevertheless I will go, that\nI may see my dear son and learn what sorrow has befallen him though he\nis still holding aloof from battle.\"\n\nShe left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping\nafter, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached the\nrich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long line on to\nthe sands, at the place where the ships of the Myrmidons were drawn up\nin close order round the tents of Achilles. His mother went up to him\nas he lay groaning; she laid her hand upon his head and spoke\npiteously, saying, \"My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow has\nnow befallen you? Tell me; hide it not from me. Surely Jove has granted\nyou the prayer you made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought\nhim that the Achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and\nrue it bitterly in that you were no longer with them.\"\n\nAchilles groaned and answered, \"Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed\nvouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to me,\nseeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen--he whom I valued more\nthan all others, and loved as dearly as my own life? I have lost him;\naye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped the wondrous armour, so\nglorious to behold, which the gods gave to Peleus when they laid you in\nthe couch of a mortal man. Would that you were still dwelling among the\nimmortal sea-nymphs, and that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal\nbride. For now you shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of\nthat son whom you can never welcome home--nay, I will not live nor go\nabout among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for\nhaving slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.\"\n\nThetis wept and answered, \"Then, my son, is your end near at hand--for\nyour own death awaits you full soon after that of Hector.\"\n\nThen said Achilles in his great grief, \"I would die here and now, in\nthat I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home, and in\nhis hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What is there for\nme? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have brought no saving\nneither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades of whom so many have been\nslain by mighty Hector; I stay here by my ships a bootless burden upon\nthe earth, I, who in fight have no peer among the Achaeans, though in\ncouncil there are better than I. Therefore, perish strife both from\namong gods and men, and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden\nhis heart--which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the\ntaste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even so has Agamemnon\nangered me. And yet--so be it, for it is over; I will force my soul\ninto subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will pursue Hector who\nhas slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will then abide my doom when\nit may please Jove and the other gods to send it. Even Hercules, the\nbest beloved of Jove--even he could not escape the hand of death, but\nfate and Juno's fierce anger laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am\ndead if a like doom awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid\nTrojan and Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with\nboth their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall\nthey know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no longer.\nHold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for you shall not\nmove me.\"\n\nThen silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, what you have said is\ntrue. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but your\narmour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in triumph upon\nhis own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt shall not be\nlasting, for his end is close at hand; go not, however, into the press\nof battle till you see me return hither; to-morrow at break of day I\nshall be here, and will bring you goodly armour from King Vulcan.\"\n\nOn this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said to the\nsea-nymphs her sisters, \"Dive into the bosom of the sea and go to the\nhouse of the old sea-god my father. Tell him everything; as for me, I\nwill go to the cunning workman Vulcan on high Olympus, and ask him to\nprovide my son with a suit of splendid armour.\"\n\nWhen she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves, while\nsilver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the armour for\nher son.\n\nThus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and meanwhile the\nAchaeans were flying with loud cries before murderous Hector till they\nreached the ships and the Hellespont, and they could not draw the body\nof Mars's servant Patroclus out of reach of the weapons that were\nshowered upon him, for Hector son of Priam with his host and horsemen\nhad again caught up to him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice\ndid brave Hector seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to\ndraw him away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two\nAjaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off the\nbody; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of the\nfight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but he would\ngive no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase some famished\nlion from a carcase, even so could not the two Ajaxes scare Hector son\nof Priam from the body of Patroclus.\n\nAnd now he would even have dragged it off and have won imperishable\nglory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her way as messenger from\nOlympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him arm. She came secretly\nwithout the knowledge of Jove and of the other gods, for Juno sent her,\nand when she had got close to him she said, \"Up, son of Peleus,\nmightiest of all mankind; rescue Patroclus about whom this fearful\nfight is now raging by the ships. Men are killing one another, the\nDanaans in defence of the dead body, while the Trojans are trying to\nhale it away, and take it to windy Ilius: Hector is the most furious of\nthem all; he is for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on the\nstakes of the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the\nthought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy. Shame on\nyou, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.\"\n\nAnd Achilles said, \"Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you to me?\"\n\nIris answered, \"It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son of\nSaturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of the\nimmortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.\"\n\nThen fleet Achilles answered her saying, \"How can I go up into the\nbattle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till I should\nsee her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour from Vulcan; I\nknow no man whose arms I can put on, save only the shield of Ajax son\nof Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in the front rank and\nwielding his spear about the body of dead Patroclus.\"\n\nIris said, \"We know that your armour has been taken, but go as you are;\ngo to the deep trench and show yourself before the Trojans, that they\nmay fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the fainting sons of the\nAchaeans gain some brief breathing-time, which in battle may hardly be.\"\n\nIris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove arose,\nand Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong shoulders; she\ncrowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from which she kindled a\nglow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes up into heaven from some\ncity that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea--all day\nlong do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at the\ngoing down of the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring\nhigh for those that dwell near them to behold, if so be that they may\ncome with their ships and succour them--even so did the light flare\nfrom the head of Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond the\nwall--but he did not join the Achaeans for he heeded the charge which\nhis mother laid upon him.\n\nThere did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice from\nafar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans. Ringing as the\nnote of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe is at the gates of a\ncity, even so brazen was the voice of the son of Aeacus, and when the\nTrojans heard its clarion tones they were dismayed; the horses turned\nback with their chariots for they boded mischief, and their drivers\nwere awe-struck by the steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess had\nkindled above the head of the great son of Peleus.\n\nThrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench, and\nthrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into confusion;\nwhereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath the wheels of\ntheir chariots and perished by their own spears. The Achaeans to their\ngreat joy then drew Patroclus out of reach of the weapons, and laid him\non a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among them\nfleet Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead\nupon his bier. He had sent him out with horses and chariots into\nbattle, but his return he was not to welcome.\n\nThen Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters of\nOceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and turmoil\nof war.\n\nNow the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked their\nhorses and gathered in assembly before preparing their supper. They\nkept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for fear had fallen\nupon them all because Achilles had shown himself after having held\naloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of Panthous was first to\nspeak, a man of judgement, who alone among them could look both before\nand after. He was comrade to Hector, and they had been born upon the\nsame night; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\nthem thus:--\n\n\"Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to your\ncity and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are far from\nour walls. So long as this man was at enmity with Agamemnon the\nAchaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have gladly camped by\nthe ships in the hope of taking them; but now I go in great fear of the\nfleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that he will never bide here on\nthe plain whereon the Trojans and Achaeans fight with equal valour, but\nhe will try to storm our city and carry off our women. Do then as I\nsay, and let us retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of\nnight will for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us here in\nthe morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have\nknowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who can escape\nand get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat for dogs and\nvultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I say, little though\nwe may like it, we shall have strength in counsel during the night, and\nthe great gates with the doors that close them will protect the city.\nAt dawn we can arm and take our stand on the walls; he will then rue it\nif he sallies from the ships to fight us. He will go back when he has\ngiven his horses their fill of being driven all whithers under our\nwalls, and will be in no mind to try and force his way into the city.\nNeither will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.\"\n\nHector looked fiercely at him and answered, \"Polydamas, your words are\nnot to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent within the\ncity. Have you not had enough of being cooped up behind walls? In the\nold-days the city of Priam was famous the whole world over for its\nwealth of gold and bronze, but our treasures are wasted out of our\nhouses, and much goods have been sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia,\nfor the hand of Jove has been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore,\nthat the son of scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and\nto hem the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool's\nwise among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not be;\ndo all of you as I now say;--take your suppers in your companies\nthroughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every man of\nyou. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let him gather them\nand give them out among the people. Better let these, rather than the\nAchaeans, have them. At daybreak we will arm and fight about the ships;\ngranted that Achilles has again come forward to defend them, let it be\nas he will, but it shall go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but\nwill fight him, to fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like\nmeasure to all, and the slayer may yet be slain.\"\n\nThus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted in\napplause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their understanding.\nThey gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but the wise words of\nPolydamas no man would heed. They took their supper throughout the\nhost, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned\nPatroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his\nmurderous hands upon the breast of his comrade, groaning again and\nagain as a bearded lion when a man who was chasing deer has robbed him\nof his young in some dense forest; when the lion comes back he is\nfurious, and searches dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can\nfind him, for he is mad with rage--even so with many a sigh did\nAchilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, \"Alas! vain were the words\nwith which I cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that I\nwould bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked\nIlius and taken his share of the spoils--but Jove does not give all men\ntheir heart's desire. The same soil shall be reddened here at Troy by\nthe blood of us both, for I too shall never be welcomed home by the old\nknight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis, but even in this place shall\nthe earth cover me. Nevertheless, O Patroclus, now that I am left\nbehind you, I will not bury you, till I have brought hither the head\nand armour of mighty Hector who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of\nTrojans will I behead before your bier to avenge you; till I have done\nso you shall lie as you are by the ships, and fair women of Troy and\nDardanus, whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we\nsacked men's goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.\"\n\nThen Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire that\nthey might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon they set a\ntripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they threw sticks on to\nit to make it blaze, and the water became hot as the flame played about\nthe belly of the tripod. When the water in the cauldron was boiling\nthey washed the body, anointed it with oil, and closed its wounds with\nointment that had been kept nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and\ncovered it with a linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they\nlaid a fair white robe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather\nround Achilles to mourn Patroclus.\n\nThen Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, \"So, Queen Juno, you have\ngained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think that\nthe Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.\"\n\nAnd Juno answered, \"Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this thing?\nMay not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than we do, do\nwhat he can for another person? And shall not I--foremost of all\ngoddesses both by descent and as wife to you who reign in\nheaven--devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry with them?\"\n\nThus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of Vulcan,\nimperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in heaven, a house\nof bronze wrought by the lame god's own hands. She found him busy with\nhis bellows, sweating and hard at work, for he was making twenty\ntripods that were to stand by the wall of his house, and he set wheels\nof gold under them all that they might go of their own selves to the\nassemblies of the gods, and come back again--marvels indeed to see.\nThey were finished all but the ears of cunning workmanship which yet\nremained to be fixed to them: these he was now fixing, and he was\nhammering at the rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis\ncame to the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to the\nfar-famed lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and took\nher hand in her own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house, Thetis,\nhonoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? Come inside\nand let me set refreshment before you.\"\n\nThe goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a richly\ndecorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool also under her\nfeet. Then she called Vulcan and said, \"Vulcan, come here, Thetis wants\nyou\"; and the far-famed lame god answered, \"Then it is indeed an august\nand honoured goddess who has come here; she it was that took care of me\nwhen I was suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel\nmother's anger--for she would have got rid of me because I was lame. It\nwould have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome, daughter of the\never-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis, taken me to their bosom.\nNine years did I stay with them, and many beautiful works in bronze,\nbrooches, spiral armlets, cups, and chains, did I make for them in\ntheir cave, with the roaring waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed\never past it; and no one knew, neither of gods nor men, save only\nThetis and Eurynome who took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to\nmy house I must make her due requital for having saved me; entertain\nher, therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and all\nmy tools.\"\n\nOn this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin legs\nplying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the fire, and\ngathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a sponge and\nwashed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny neck; he donned\nhis shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped towards the door. There\nwere golden handmaids also who worked for him, and were like real young\nwomen, with sense and reason, voice also and strength, and all the\nlearning of the immortals; these busied themselves as the king bade\nthem, while he drew near to Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and\ntook her hand in his own, saying, \"Why have you come to our house,\nThetis honoured and ever welcome--for you do not visit us often? Say\nwhat you want, and I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can\nbe done at all.\"\n\nThetis wept and answered, \"Vulcan, is there another goddess in Olympus\nwhom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction\nas he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a\nmortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus, and sorely against my will did I\nsubmit to the embraces of one who was but mortal, and who now stays at\nhome worn out with age. Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed me a\nson, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended him as a\nplant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight\nthe Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus.\nSo long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun, he is in\nheaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King Agamemnon has\nmade him give up the maiden whom the sons of the Achaeans had awarded\nhim, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed\nthe Achaeans in at their ships' sterns and would not let them come\nforth; the elders, therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and\noffered him great treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to\nthem himself, but put his own armour on Patroclus and sent him into the\nfight with much people after him. All day long they fought by the\nScaean gates and would have taken the city there and then, had not\nApollo vouchsafed glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of\nMenoetius after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am\nsuppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son,\nwhose end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves\nfitted with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own\nwhen his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies\nstretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.\"\n\nAnd Vulcan answered, \"Take heart, and be no more disquieted about this\nmatter; would that I could hide him from death's sight when his hour is\ncome, so surely as I can find him armour that shall amaze the eyes of\nall who behold it.\"\n\nWhen he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning them\ntowards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty bellows blew\nupon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some fierce\nto help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as Vulcan\nwilled it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the\nfire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its\nblock, and with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the\ntongs in the other.\n\nFirst he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all over\nand binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three layers; and the\nbaldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five thicknesses, and\nwith many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it.\n\nHe wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at her\nfull and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify the face of\nheaven--the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which men\nalso call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing\nOrion, and alone never dips into the stream of Oceanus.\n\nHe wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of men.\nIn the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were going about\nthe city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight from their\nchambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\nmusic of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door\nto see them.\n\nMeanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a\nquarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a man who\nhad been killed, the one saying before the people that he had paid\ndamages in full, and the other that he had not been paid. Each was\ntrying to make his own case good, and the people took sides, each man\nbacking the side that he had taken; but the heralds kept them back, and\nthe elders sate on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the\nstaves which the heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and\neach in his turn gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down,\nto be given to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.\n\nAbout the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming armour,\nand they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it and accept the\nhalf of what it contained. But the men of the city would not yet\nconsent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\nchildren kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who were\npast fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with Mars and\nPallas Minerva at their head--both of them wrought in gold and clad in\ngolden raiment, great and fair with their armour as befitting gods,\nwhile they that followed were smaller. When they reached the place\nwhere they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which live\nstock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here, then,\nthey lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them there were\ntwo scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or cattle,\nwhich presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on\ntheir pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those who\nwere in ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killed\nthe shepherds. Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noise\namong the cattle as they sat in council, sprang to their horses, and\nmade with all speed towards them; when they reached them they set\nbattle in array by the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their\nbronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and\nfell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh wound,\nand the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging\nhim along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They\nwent in and out with one another and fought as though they were living\npeople haling away one another's dead.\n\nHe wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed already.\nMany men were working at the plough within it, turning their oxen to\nand fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on reaching\nthe headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\nand they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time\nwhen they should again reach the headland. The part that they had\nploughed was dark behind them, so that the field, though it was of\ngold, still looked as if it were being ploughed--very curious to behold.\n\nHe wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were reaping\nwith sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe fell to the\nground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them in\nbands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them there\nwere boys who gathered the cut corn in armfuls and kept on bringing\nthem to be bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in\nsilence and was glad. The servants were getting a meal ready under an\noak, for they had sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up,\nwhile the women were making a porridge of much white barley for the\nlabourers' dinner.\n\nHe wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines were\nloaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the vines were\ntrained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all round it,\nand fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and\nby this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. Youths\nand maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in\nplaited baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet music\nwith his lyre, and sang the Linos-song with his clear boyish voice.\n\nHe wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He made the cows of gold and\ntin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards to go and\nfeed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the river. Along\nwith the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold, and\ntheir nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened\non a bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he\nmight they haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore\nthrough the bull's thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels,\nbut the herdsmen were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their\ndogs; the dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking and\nkeeping out of harm's way.\n\nThe god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a large\nflock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered sheepfolds.\n\nFurthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once made in\nCnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths and maidens whom\nall would woo, with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens\nwore robes of light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were\nslightly oiled. The girls were crowned with garlands, while the young\nmen had daggers of gold that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they\nwould dance deftly in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a\npotter sitting at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether\nit will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,\nand much people was gathered joyously about the green. There was a bard\nalso to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about\nperforming in the midst of them when the man struck up with his tune.\n\nAll round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty stream of\nthe river Oceanus.\n\nThen when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he made a\nbreastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made a helmet, close\nfitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume overhanging\nit; and he made greaves also of beaten tin.\n\nLastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took it and\nset it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted like a falcon\nfrom the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the gleaming armour\nfrom the house of Vulcan.\n\n\n\nBOOK XIX\n\n  Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour\n  which Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight.\n\nNOW when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of\nOceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the\nships with the armour that the god had given her. She found her son\nfallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly. Many also of\nhis followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among\nthem she clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may\nwe must let this man lie, for it is by heaven's will that he has\nfallen; now, therefore, accept from Vulcan this rich and goodly armour,\nwhich no man has ever yet borne upon his shoulders.\"\n\nAs she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out\nbravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and none\ndared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\nstill greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he\nwas glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made\nhim. Then, as soon as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he\nsaid to his mother, \"Mother, the god has given me armour, meet\nhandiwork for an immortal and such as no-one living could have\nfashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon\nthe son of Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\nbody, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\"\n\nSilver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not disquieted about this\nmatter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of noisome\nflies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle. He\nmay lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as\never, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly;\nunsay your anger against Agamemnon; arm at once, and fight with might\nand main.\"\n\nAs she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she then\ndropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of Patroclus, that his\nbody might suffer no change.\n\nThen Achilles went out upon the seashore, and with a loud cry called on\nthe Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had stayed always at\nthe ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were\nabout the ships and served out rations, all came to the place of\nassembly because Achilles had shown himself after having held aloof so\nlong from fighting. Two sons of Mars, Ulysses and the son of Tydeus,\ncame limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they\ncame, and took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of\nall came Agamemnon, king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of\nAntenor had struck him with a spear in battle.\n\nWhen the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, \"Son of\nAtreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you and me,\nwhen we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would have\nbeen better, had Diana's arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\ntook her after having sacked Lyrnessus. For so, many an Achaean the\nless would have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It\nhas been well for Hector and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long\nindeed remember our quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over.\nIf we have been angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from\nme: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm\nforthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they\nwill be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will he be\nto rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put away\nhis anger.\n\nThen Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the\nmiddle of the assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"servants of Mars, it\nis well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it is not seemly\nto interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a practised speaker. Who\ncan either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest orator will be\ndisconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do you\nother Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken\nto me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I that did it:\nJove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we\nwere assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had\nbeen awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand of\nheaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove's daughters, shuts men's eyes to\ntheir destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid earth, but\nhovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or to ensnare them.\n\n\"Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest\nwhether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled him on\nthe day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in the fair\ncity of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying, 'Hear me, all\ngods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am minded; this day\nshall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in labour, bring a man child\ninto the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are\nof my blood and lineage.' Then said Juno all crafty and full of guile,\n'You will play false, and will not hold to your word. Swear me, O\nOlympian, swear me a great oath, that he who shall this day fall\nbetween the feet of a woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about\nhim who are of your blood and lineage.'\n\n\"Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great oath,\nto his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the high summit\nof Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the\nnoble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then was. She being with child\nand in her seventh month, Juno brought the child to birth though there\nwas a month still wanting, but she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and\nkept back the Ilithuiae. Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn,\nand said, 'Father Jove, lord of the lightning--I have a word for your\near. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus\nthe son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that\nhe should reign over the Argives.'\n\n\"On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he caught\nFolly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never should she again\ninvade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was the bane of all. Then he\nwhirled her round with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from\nheaven so that she fell on to the fields of mortal men; and he was ever\nangry with her when he saw his son groaning under the cruel labours\nthat Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector\nwas killing the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept\nthinking of Folly who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me\nof my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by\nway of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with\nyou. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday in your\ntents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would fain fight at\nonce, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my ship, that you may\nsee whether what I give you is enough.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you can\ngive such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold them: it is in\nyour own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it is not well to tarry\ntalking about trifles, for there is a deed which is as yet to do.\nAchilles shall again be seen fighting among the foremost, and laying\nlow the ranks of the Trojans: bear this in mind each one of you when he\nis fighting.\"\n\nThen Ulysses said, \"Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the Achaeans\nthus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the battle will be\nno brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven has filled both sides\nwith fury; bid them first take food both bread and wine by the ships,\nfor in this there is strength and stay. No man can do battle the\nlivelong day to the going down of the sun if he is without food;\nhowever much he may want to fight his strength will fail him before he\nknows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his limbs will grow\nweary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed with\nmeat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\nhas routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them\nprepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence\nof the assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied.\nMoreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that he has never\ngone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her after the manner\nof men and women; and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind;\nlet Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with a feast of\nreconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in full. As for you,\nson of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it is no\ndisgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in\nthe first instance.\"\n\nAnd King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of Laertes, your words please me\nwell, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would\nhave me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name\nof heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\nat once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent\nand we ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you:\ntake some noble young Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the\ngifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;\nfurthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are with the\nhost, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the sun.\"\n\nThen said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to these\nmatters at some other season, when there is breathing time and when I\nam calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of those whom Hector\nson of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon the plain? Let the sons\nof the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and without food, till we have\navenged them; afterwards at the going down of the sun let them eat\ntheir fill. As for me, Patroclus is lying dead in my tent, all hacked\nand hewn, with his feet to the door, and his comrades are mourning\nround him. Therefore I can take thought of nothing save only slaughter\nand blood and the rattle in the throat of the dying.\"\n\nUlysses answered, \"Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the\nAchaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a little,\nbut in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and of greater\nknowledge. Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\nwhich men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who is war's steward, weighs the\nupshot, it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped\nis far heavier than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should\nmourn the dead with their bellies; day by day men fall thick and\nthreefold continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let\nus mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but\nlet those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight\nour foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for\na second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found\nlagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as one man and loose\nthe fury of war upon the Trojans.\"\n\nWhen he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with Meges\nson of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes, and\nMelanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The word\nwas not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\ntripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons\nand the twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful\narts, seven in number, with Briseis, which made eight. Ulysses weighed\nout the ten talents of gold and then led the way back, while the young\nAchaeans brought the rest of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of\nthe assembly.\n\nAgamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of a god\ncame to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife which he\nwore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting off some\nbristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\nThe other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear\nthe king, and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed\nsaying, \"I call Jove the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I\ncall also Earth and Sun and the Erinyes who dwell below and take\nvengeance on him who shall swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon\nthe girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that\nshe has remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven\nvisit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who perjure\nthemselves.\"\n\nHe cut the boar's throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled it\nround his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the fishes. Then\nAchilles also rose and said to the Argives, \"Father Jove, of a truth\nyou blind men's eyes and bane them. The son of Atreus had not else\nstirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so stubbornly taken Briseis from\nme against my will. Surely Jove must have counselled the destruction of\nmany an Argive. Go, now, and take your food that we may begin fighting.\"\n\nOn this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his own\nship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them away to the\nship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents, while the stable-men\ndrove the horses in among the others.\n\nBriseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of Patroclus,\nflung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her breast, her neck,\nand her lovely face with both her hands. Beautiful as a goddess she\nwept and said, \"Patroclus, dearest friend, when I went hence I left you\nliving; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\nmultiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and\nmother married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear\nbrothers perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus,\neven when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,\ntold me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make Achilles\nmarry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should have a wedding\nfeast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to me and I shall never\ncease to grieve for you.\"\n\nShe wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making as\nthough their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was weeping\nfor her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered round Achilles\nand prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\npray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat\nnor drink, for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to\nthe going down of the sun.\"\n\nOn this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of\nAtreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix, who\nstayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his sorrow:\nbut he would not be comforted till he should have flung himself into\nthe jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on sigh, thinking ever of\nPatroclus. Then he said--\n\n\"Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good dinner\nready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans were hasting\nto fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have meat and drink in\nmy tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief greater than this I could\nnot know, not even though I were to hear of the death of my father, who\nis now in Phthia weeping for the loss of me his son, who am here\nfighting the Trojans in a strange land for the accursed sake of Helen,\nnor yet though I should hear that my son is no more--he who is being\nbrought up in Scyros--if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I\nmade sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while\nyou were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your own\nship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the greatness of\nmy house--for Peleus must surely be either dead, or what little life\nremains to him is oppressed alike with the infirmities of age and ever\npresent fear lest he should hear the sad tidings of my death.\"\n\nHe wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each thought\non what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn looked down\nwith pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva, \"My child, you have\nquite deserted your hero; is he then gone so clean out of your\nrecollection? There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of\nhis dear comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he\nwill neither eat nor drink. Go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into\nhis breast, that he may know no hunger.\"\n\nWith these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same mind.\nShe darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon sailing on\nhis broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were arming\nthroughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped nectar and ambrosia\ninto Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail\nhim, she went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the\nchill snow-flakes shed from the hand of Jove and borne on the keen\nblasts of the north wind, even so thick did the gleaming helmets, the\nbossed shields, the strongly plated breastplates, and the ashen spears\nstream from the ships. The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was\nradiant with their flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their\ntreading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles\nput on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\nfor his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of fury\nagainst the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the armour that\nVulcan had made him.\n\nFirst he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and next\nhe did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the silver-studded\nsword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield so\ngreat and strong that shone afar with a splendour as of the moon. As\nthe light seen by sailors from out at sea, when men have lit a fire in\ntheir homestead high up among the mountains, but the sailors are\ncarried out to sea by wind and storm far from the haven where they\nwould be--even so did the gleam of Achilles' wondrous shield strike up\ninto the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his\nhead, from whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which\nVulcan had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around\nit. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether it\nfitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it seemed\nto buoy him up as though it had been wings.\n\nHe also drew his father's spear out of the spear-stand, a spear so\ngreat and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only Achilles\nhad strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash from the\ntopmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\nfraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alcimus busied\nthemselves with the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast\nabout them, and put the bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back\ntowards the chariot. Automedon, whip in hand, sprang up behind the\nhorses, and after him Achilles mounted in full armour, resplendent as\nthe sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he chided with his\nfather's horses saying, \"Xanthus and Balius, famed offspring of\nPodarge--this time when we have done fighting be sure and bring your\ndriver safely back to the host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him\ndead on the plain as you did Patroclus.\"\n\nThen fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke--for white-armed Juno had\nendowed him with human speech--and he bowed his head till his mane\ntouched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread\nAchilles,\" said he, \"we will indeed save you now, but the day of your\ndeath is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it will be heaven\nand stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth\nor slackness on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroclus of his\narmour; it was the mighty god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he\nfought among the foremost, and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two\ncan fly as swiftly as Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds;\nnevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.\"\n\nWhen he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles\nanswered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O Xanthus, do you thus\nforetell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that I am to\nfall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the more, however,\nshall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans their fill of\nfighting.\"\n\nSo saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front.\n\n\n\nBOOK XX\n\n  The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from\n  the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules--A fight\n  between Achilles and AEneas is interrupted by Neptune, who\n  saves AEneas--Achilles kills many Trojans.\n\nTHUS, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son of\nPeleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over against\nthem armed upon the rise of the plain.\n\nMeanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis gather\nthe gods in council, whereon she went about and called them to the\nhouse of Jove. There was not a river absent except Oceanus, nor a\nsingle one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves, or springs of rivers\nand meadows of green grass. When they reached the house of\ncloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats in the arcades of polished\nmarble which Vulcan with his consummate skill had made for father Jove.\n\nIn such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove. Neptune\nalso, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the goddess, and came\nup out of the sea to join them. There, sitting in the midst of them, he\nasked what Jove's purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the\nlightning, have you called the gods in council? Are you considering\nsome matter that concerns the Trojans and Achaeans--for the blaze of\nbattle is on the point of being kindled between them?\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and wherefore\nI have called you hither. I take thought for them even in their\ndestruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on Mt. Olympus\nand look on in peace, but do you others go about among Trojans and\nAchaeans, and help either side as you may be severally disposed. If\nAchilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand\nagainst him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that\nhe is roused to such fury about his comrade, he will override fate\nitself and storm their city.\"\n\nThus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took their\nseveral sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,\nearth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and excellent in\nall cunning--all these joined the host that came from the ships; with\nthem also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping, but yet with his thin\nlegs plying lustily under him. Mars of gleaming helmet joined the\nTrojans, and with him Apollo of locks unshorn, and the archer goddess\nDiana, Leto, Xanthus, and laughter-loving Venus.\n\nSo long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors the\nAchaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused to fight\nwas now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\nfear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armour,\nand looking like Mars himself. When, however, the Olympians came to\ntake their part among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of\nhosts, and Minerva raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep\ntrench that ran outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might\nupon the shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the\nother side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans\nat the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding up\nthe side of the river Simois till he came to the hill Callicolone.\n\nThus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce\ncontention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men thundered\nfrom heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the vast earth, and\nbade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained\nIda quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the\nAchaeans. Hades, king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he\nsprang panic-stricken from his throne and cried aloud in terror lest\nNeptune, lord of the earthquake, should crack the ground over his head,\nand lay bare his mouldy mansions to the sight of mortals and\nimmortals--mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think\nof them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in battle.\nApollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Neptune, while\nMinerva took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Diana with\nher golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Juno;\nMercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty\neddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods Xanthus, matched himself\nagainst Vulcan.\n\nThe gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the heart of\nAchilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it was with his\nblood that he longed above all things else to glut the stubborn lord of\nbattle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and\nput courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of\nPriam. In his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \"Aeneas,\ncounsellor of the Trojans, where are now the brave words with which you\nvaunted over your wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would\nfight Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?\"\n\nAnd Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son of\nPeleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now, it would\nnot be for the first time. His spear has already put me to flight from\nIda, when he attacked our cattle and sacked Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove\nindeed saved me in that he vouchsafed me strength to fly, else had I\nfallen by the hands of Achilles and Minerva, who went before him to\nprotect him and urged him to fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man\nmay fight Achilles, for one of the gods is always with him as his\nguardian angel, and even were it not so, his weapon flies ever\nstraight, and fails not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him;\nif heaven would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon\novercome me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.\"\n\nThen said King Apollo, son to Jove, \"Nay, hero, pray to the ever-living\ngods, for men say that you were born of Jove's daughter Venus, whereas\nAchilles is son to a goddess of inferior rank. Venus is child to Jove,\nwhile Thetis is but daughter to the old man of the sea. Bring,\ntherefore, your spear to bear upon him, and let him not scare you with\nhis taunts and menaces.\"\n\nAs he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his\npeople, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the foremost\nfighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\nJuno, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the\ngods about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva,\nand consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas\nclad in full armour to fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once,\nor shall one of us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so\nthat his heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the\nimmortals are on his side, while the others who have all along been\ndefending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down from\nOlympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no hurt at the\nhands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer whatever fate may have\nspun out for him when he was begotten and his mother bore him. If\nAchilles be not thus assured by the voice of a god, he may come to fear\npresently when one of us meets him in battle, for the gods are terrible\nif they are seen face to face.\"\n\nNeptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, \"Juno, restrain\nyour fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing the other gods\nto fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on our own side; let us\ntake our places on some hill out of the beaten track, and let mortals\nfight it out among themselves. If Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin\nfighting, or keep Achilles in check so that he cannot fight, we too,\nwill at once raise the cry of battle, and in that case they will soon\nleave the field and go back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.\"\n\nWith these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high\nearth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by the\nTrojans and Pallas Minerva for him to fly to when the sea-monster was\nchasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here Neptune and those that\nwere with him took their seats, wrapped in a thick cloud of darkness;\nbut the other gods seated themselves on the brow of Callicolone round\nyou, O Phoebus, and Mars the waster of cities.\n\nThus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither side was\nwilling to begin battle with the other, and Jove from his seat on high\nwas in command over them all. Meanwhile the whole plain was alive with\nmen and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armour. The earth rang\nagain under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other,\nand two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the\nhosts to fight--to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles.\n\nAeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet\ntossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before his\nbreast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus from the\nother side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce lion that the\nwhole country-side has met to hunt and kill--at first he bodes no ill,\nbut when some daring youth has struck him with a spear, he crouches\nopenmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars with fury, he lashes his tail from\nside to side about his ribs and loins, and glares as he springs\nstraight before him, to find out whether he is to slay, or be slain\namong the foremost of his foes--even with such fury did Achilles burn\nto spring upon Aeneas.\n\nWhen they were now close up with one another Achilles was first to\nspeak. \"Aeneas,\" said he, \"why do you stand thus out before the host to\nfight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the Trojans in the seat of\nPriam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will not hand his kingdom over to\nyou. He is a man of sound judgement, and he has sons of his own. Or\nhave the Trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness, fair\nwith orchard lawns and corn lands, if you should slay me? This you\nshall hardly do. I have discomfited you once already. Have you\nforgotten how when you were alone I chased you from your herds\nhelter-skelter down the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look\nbehind you; you took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and\nwith the help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its\nwomen into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You\nthink they will protect you now, but they will not do so; therefore I\nsay go back into the host, and do not face me, or you will rue it. Even\na fool may be wise after the event.\"\n\nThen Aeneas answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can\nscare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag and talk\nunseemly. We know one another's race and parentage as matters of common\nfame, though neither have you ever seen my parents nor I yours. Men say\nthat you are son to noble Peleus, and that your mother is Thetis,\nfair-haired daughter of the sea. I have noble Anchises for my father,\nand Venus for my mother; the parents of one or other of us shall this\nday mourn a son, for it will be more than silly talk that shall part us\nwhen the fight is over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will--and it is\nknown to many.\n\n\"In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded Dardania,\nfor Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men to dwell in, and\nher people still abode on the spurs of many-fountained Ida. Dardanus\nhad a son, king Erichthonius, who was wealthiest of all men living; he\nhad three thousand mares that fed by the water-meadows, they and their\nfoals with them. Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and\ncovered them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly\nfoals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped over the\nrich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of corn and not\nbreak them; or again when they would disport themselves on the broad\nback of Ocean they could gallop on the crest of a breaker. Erichthonius\nbegat Tros, king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus,\nAssaracus, and Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the\ngods carried him off to be Jove's cupbearer, for his beauty's sake,\nthat he might dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and\nLaomedon begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the\nstock of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to\nAnchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam.\n\n\"Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove gives\nit or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now let there be\nno more of this prating in mid-battle as though we were children. We\ncould fling taunts without end at one another; a hundred-oared galley\nwould not hold them. The tongue can run all whithers and talk all wise;\nit can go here and there, and as a man says, so shall he be gainsaid.\nWhat is the use of our bandying hard like women who when they fall foul\nof one another go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the\nother lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now\nthat I am fain to fight--therefore let us make trial of one another\nwith our spears.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield of\nAchilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of Peleus held\nthe shield before him with his strong hand, and he was afraid, for he\ndeemed that Aeneas's spear would go through it quite easily, not\nreflecting that the god's glorious gifts were little likely to yield\nbefore the blows of mortal men; and indeed Aeneas's spear did not\npierce the shield, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the\npoint. It went through two layers, but the god had made the shield in\nfive, two of bronze, the two innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it\nwas in this that the spear was stayed.\n\nAchilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas at\nthe very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of Pelian ash\nwent clean through, and the shield rang under the blow; Aeneas was\nafraid, and crouched backwards, holding the shield away from him; the\nspear, however, flew over his back, and stuck quivering in the ground,\nafter having gone through both circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas\nthough he had avoided the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and\ngrief because the weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang\nfuriously upon him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade\ndrawn, and Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men\nnow are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite easily.\n\nAeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing towards him,\neither on the helmet, or on the shield that covered him, and Achilles\nwould have closed with him and despatched him with his sword, had not\nNeptune lord of the earthquake been quick to mark, and said forthwith\nto the immortals, \"Alas, I am sorry for great Aeneas, who will now go\ndown to the house of Hades, vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that\nhe was to give ear to the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him\nfrom destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to\nno purpose, and in another's quarrel? Has he not at all times offered\nacceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven? Let us then\nsnatch him from death's jaws, lest the son of Saturn be angry should\nAchilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he should escape, and\nthat the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved above all the sons born to\nhim of mortal women, shall not perish utterly without seed or sign. For\nnow indeed has Jove hated the blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign\nover the Trojans, he and his children's children that shall be born\nhereafter.\"\n\nThen answered Juno, \"Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself, and\nconsider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or suffer him,\nbrave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles son of Peleus. For\nof a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have sworn full many a time\nbefore all the immortals, that never would we shield Trojans from\ndestruction, not even when all Troy is burning in the flames that the\nAchaeans shall kindle.\"\n\nWhen earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle amid\nthe clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles and Aeneas\nwere. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of the son of\nPeleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the shield of Aeneas,\nand laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he lifted Aeneas on high from\noff the earth and hurried him away. Over the heads of many a band of\nwarriors both horse and foot did he soar as the god's hand sped him,\ntill he came to the very fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were\narming themselves for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came\nnear to him and said, \"Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly\nin fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour and\nmore beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him whensoever you\nmeet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades even though fate would\nhave it otherwise. When Achilles is dead you may then fight among the\nforemost undaunted, for none other of the Achaeans shall slay you.\"\n\nThe god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at once\nremoved the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who opened them\nwide indeed and said in great anger, \"Alas! what marvel am I now\nbeholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but I see not him whom I\nmeant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth Aeneas also must be under\nheaven's protection, although I had thought his boasting was idle. Let\nhim go hang; he will be in no mood to fight me further, seeing how\nnarrowly he has missed being killed. I will now give my orders to the\nDanaans and attack some other of the Trojans.\"\n\nHe sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did so.\n\"Let not the Trojans,\" he cried, \"keep you at arm's length, Achaeans,\nbut go for them and fight them man for man. However valiant I may be, I\ncannot give chase to so many and fight all of them. Even Mars, who is\nan immortal, or Minerva, would shrink from flinging himself into the\njaws of such a fight and laying about him; nevertheless, so far as in\nme lies I will show no slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance,\nnot even for a moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the\nTrojan who shall venture within reach of my spear.\"\n\nThus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and\ndeclared that he would fight Achilles. \"Be not afraid, proud Trojans,\"\nsaid he, \"to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the\nbattle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for\nme, if we had to use our spears. Even so the deed of Achilles will fall\nsomewhat short of his word; he will do in part, and the other part he\nwill clip short. I will go up against him though his hands be as\nfire--though his hands be fire and his strength iron.\"\n\nThus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the Achaeans, and\nraised the cry of battle as they flung themselves into the midst of\ntheir ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to Hector and said, \"Hector, on\nno account must you challenge Achilles to single combat; keep a lookout\nfor him while you are under cover of the others and away from the thick\nof the fight, otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you\ndown at close quarters.\"\n\nThus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was afraid\nwhen he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then sprang upon\nthe Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as with a garment.\nFirst he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a leader of much people whom\na naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus waster of cities, in the land of\nHyde under the snowy heights of Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on\nthe head as he was coming on towards him, and split it clean in two;\nwhereon he fell heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him\nsaying, \"You be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here,\nbut your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father's estate\nlies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The\nchariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over him in\nthe front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed Demoleon, a\nvaliant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him on the temple\nthrough his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear,\nbut it went right on, crushing the bone so that the brain inside was\nshed in all directions, and his lust of fighting was ended. Then he\nstruck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was springing down from his\nchariot in front of him, and trying to escape. He breathed his last,\nbellowing like a bull bellows when young men are dragging him to offer\nhim in sacrifice to the King of Helice, and the heart of the\nearth-shaker is glad; even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles\nthen went in pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had\nalways forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the\none he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and showing\noff the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among front ranks\nuntil he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in the middle of the\nback as he was darting past him: he struck him just at the golden\nfastenings of his belt and where the two pieces of the double\nbreastplate overlapped. The point of the spear pierced him through and\ncame out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a\ncloud of darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in\nhis hands.\n\nWhen Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his hands\nand sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his eyes, and he\ncould not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised his\nspear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles\nsaw him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has\nwounded my heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for\nlong shall we two quail before one another on the highways of war.\"\n\nHe looked fiercely on Hector and said, \"Draw near, that you may meet\nyour doom the sooner.\" Hector feared him not and answered, \"Son of\nPeleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I were a\nchild; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are\na mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies\nin the lap of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you\nwith my spear, for this too has been found keen ere now.\"\n\nHe hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it, and\nthough she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from going\ntowards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at his feet in\nfront of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry,\nbent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and\nhid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him\nspear in hand, and thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he\nrushed forward for the fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted\naloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death--but of a\ntruth it came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems\nyou pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too\nhave any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you when I\ncome across you at some other time. Now, however, I will pursue and\novertake other Trojans.\"\n\nOn this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his neck,\nand he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and stayed\nDemouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by\nhitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword\nand killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of\nBias, and threw them from their chariot, the one with a blow from a\nthrown spear, while the other he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There\nwas also Tros the son of Alastor--he came up to Achilles and clasped\nhis knees in the hope that he would spare him and not kill him but let\nhim go, because they were both of the same age. Fool, he might have\nknown that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood\nfor pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros\nlaid hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles\ndrove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while\nhis bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled from the\nwound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.\n\nAchilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a spear,\nand the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear. He also\nstruck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which became\nwarm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\nEcheclus. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deucalion\nin the fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he\nwaited Achilles' onset with his arm hanging down and death staring him\nin the face. Achilles cut his head off with a blow from his sword and\nflung it helmet and all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out\nof his backbone as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble\nson of Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through\nthe middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he\nfell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous squire to\nRhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in flight, and thrust\nhim from his chariot, while the horses were struck with panic.\n\nAs a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought--and the\ndense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues of\nfire in every direction--even so furiously did Achilles rage, wielding\nhis spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to those whom he\nwould slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or as one who yokes\nbroad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a threshing-floor--and\nit is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing cattle--even so\ndid the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies of the\nslain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\nbespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses' hoofs, and\nfrom the tyres of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win\nstill further glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore.\n\n\n\nBOOK XXI\n\n  The fight between Achilles and the river Scamander--The gods\n  fight among themselves--Achilles drives the Trojans within\n  their gates.\n\nNOW when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,\nbegotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half\nhe chased over the plain towards the city by the same way that the\nAchaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the preceding day with\nHector in full triumph; this way did they fly pell-mell, and Juno sent\ndown a thick mist in front of them to stay them. The other half were\nhemmed in by the deep silver-eddying stream, and fell into it with a\ngreat uproar. The waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they\nswam hither and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. As\nlocusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire--the flame\ncomes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle into the\nwater--even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled with the uproar\nof men and horses, all struggling in confusion before Achilles.\n\nForthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it against a\ntamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god, armed with his\nsword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the Trojans down on every\nside. Their dying groans rose hideous as the sword smote them, and the\nriver ran red with blood. As when fish fly scared before a huge\ndolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair haven--for he is\nsure to eat all he can catch--even so did the Trojans cower under the\nbanks of the mighty river, and when Achilles' arms grew weary with\nkilling them, he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to\nsacrifice in revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them out\nlike dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles of\ntheir own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to the\nships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still further blood.\n\nThere he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was\nescaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner\nwhen he was in his father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, as\nhe was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker\nsides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him to his sorrow unawares,\nand sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the son of Jason bought him. But a\nguest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and sent\nhim to Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father's\nhouse. He had spent eleven days happily with his friends after he had\ncome from Lemnos, but on the twelfth heaven again delivered him into\nthe hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades sorely\nagainst his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight of him, and\nhad neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear, for he had\nthrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was sweating with\nhis struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength was now\nfailing him.\n\nThen Achilles said to himself in his surprise, \"What marvel do I see\nhere? If this man can come back alive after having been sold over into\nLemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the\nworld below. Could not even the waters of the grey sea imprison him, as\nthey do many another whether he will or no? This time let him taste my\nspear, that I may know for certain whether mother earth who can keep\neven a strong man down, will be able to hold him, or whether thence too\nhe will return.\"\n\nThus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and\ntrying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not die.\nAchilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lycaon\nran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed\nover his back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for\nblood. With one hand he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him, and\nwith the other he clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then he\nsaid, \"Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your\nsuppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the day\nwhen you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you sold me away\nto Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I brought you the\nprice of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times as much to gain my\nfreedom; it is but twelve days that I have come to Ilius after much\nsuffering, and now cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands.\nSurely father Jove must hate me, that he has given me over to you a\nsecond time. Short of life indeed did my mother Laothoe bear me,\ndaughter of aged Altes--of Altes who reigns over the warlike Lelegae\nand holds steep Pedasus on the river Satnioeis. Priam married his\ndaughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her,\nboth of whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus as he\nwas fighting in the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for\nI fear that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered me over\nto you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare me,\nfor I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave and noble\ncomrade.\"\n\nWith such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles; but\nAchilles answered him sternly. \"Idiot,\" said he, \"talk not to me of\nransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the Trojans quarter,\nand sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but now\nnot a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands before\nthe city of Ilius--and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with the\nsons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you\nwhine in this way? Patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you\nare. I too--see you not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble\nfather, and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and\ndeath overshadow me all as surely. The day will come, either at dawn or\ndark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in battle,\neither with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his bow.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and Lycaon's heart sank within him. He loosed his\nhold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but Achilles\ndrew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his neck; he\nplunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay\nat full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him till\nthe earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung\nhim into the river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and\nsaying, \"Lie there among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your\nwound and gloat over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to\nmourn you, but the eddies of Scamander shall bear you into the broad\nbosom of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lycaon as\nthey dart under the dark ripple of the waters--so perish all of you\ntill we reach the citadel of strong Ilius--you in flight, and I\nfollowing after to destroy you. The river with its broad silver stream\nshall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered him and all\nthe horses that you flung living into his waters. None the less\nmiserably shall you perish till there is not a man of you but has paid\nin full for the death of Patroclus and the havoc you wrought among the\nAchaeans whom you have slain while I held aloof from battle.\"\n\nSo spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and pondered\nwithin himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles and save the\nTrojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand,\nsprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to the\nbroad river Axius and Periboea eldest daughter of Acessamenus; for the\nriver had lain with her. Asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face\nhim with a spear in either hand, and Xanthus filled him with courage,\nbeing angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying\nruthlessly within his waters. When they were close up with one another\nAchilles was first to speak. \"Who and whence are you,\" said he, \"who\ndare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands up against me.\"\nAnd the son of Pelegon answered, \"Great son of Peleus, why should you\nask my lineage. I am from the fertile land of far Paeonia, captain of\nthe Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at Ilius. I am of\nthe blood of the river Axius--of Axius that is the fairest of all\nrivers that run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose son men call\nme. Let us now fight, Achilles.\"\n\nThus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian ash.\nAsteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use both hands\nalike; with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did not\npierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point;\nwith the other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles' right arm drawing\ndark blood, but the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the\nground, foiled of its bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him,\nhurled his spear at Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the\nsteep bank of the river, driving the spear half its length into the\nearth. The son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously upon\nhim. Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles' spear out of the bank\nby main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might to\ndraw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth time he\ntried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles smote him\nwith his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly near the\nnavel, so that all his bowels came gushing out on to the ground, and\nthe darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then Achilles\nset his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over\nhim and saying, \"Lie there--begotten of a river though you be, it is\nhard for you to strive with the offspring of Saturn's son. You declare\nyourself sprung from the blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed\nof mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the many\nMyrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove is\nmightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his children\nstronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover you have a great\nriver hard by if he can be of any use to you, but there is no fighting\nagainst Jove the son of Saturn, with whom not even King Achelous can\ncompare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all\nrivers and seas with all springs and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus\nfears the lightnings of great Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing\nout of heaven.\"\n\nWith this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that he had\nkilled Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the sand, with the\ndark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy nibbling and\ngnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase of\nthe Paeonians, who were flying along the bank of the river in panic\nwhen they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus.\nTherein he slew Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius,\nOeneus, and Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the\nriver in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deep\nwaters saying, \"Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do you also\nin wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect you: if, then,\nthe son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to destroy all the Trojans,\nat any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on land.\nMy fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor can I find any channel\nby which I may pour myself into the sea for I am choked with dead, and\nyet you go on mercilessly slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O\ncaptain of your host, trouble me no further.\"\n\nAchilles answered, \"So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I will\nnever cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have pent them\nup in their city, and made trial of Hector face to face, that I may\nlearn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.\"\n\nAs he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the gods.\nBut the river said to Apollo, \"Surely, son of Jove, lord of the silver\nbow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who charged you straitly\nthat you should stand by the Trojans and defend them, till twilight\nfades, and darkness is over the earth.\"\n\nMeanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon the\nriver raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his stream into a\ntorrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain and left\nwithin his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing like a\nbull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in his\nmighty eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles,\nfalling upon him and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep\nhis feet; he caught hold of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the\nroots, and tore away the bank, damming the stream with its thick\nbranches and bridging it all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of\nthe stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid.\n\nBut the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him with\na dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans from\ndestruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw from him;\nswift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and\nfleetest of all birds, even so did he spring forward, and the armour\nrang loudly about his breast. He fled on in front, but the river with a\nloud roar came tearing after. As one who would water his garden leads a\nstream from some fountain over his plants, and all his ground--spade in\nhand he clears away the dams to free the channels, and the little\nstones run rolling round and round with the water as it goes merrily\ndown the bank faster than the man can follow--even so did the river\nkeep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the\ngods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand his\nground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in league\nagainst him, so often would the mighty wave come beating down upon his\nshoulders, and he would have to keep flying on and on in great dismay;\nfor the angry flood was tiring him out as it flowed past him and ate\nthe ground from under his feet.\n\nThen the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying, \"Father\nJove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon me, and save me\nfrom the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards. I blame\nnone of the other dwellers on Olympus so severely as I do my dear\nmother, who has beguiled and tricked me. She told me I was to fall\nunder the walls of Troy by the flying arrows of Apollo; would that\nHector, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; then\nshould I fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I\nshall come to a most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I\nwere some swineherd's boy, who gets carried down a torrent while trying\nto cross it during a storm.\"\n\nAs soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him in\nthe likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure him.\nNeptune spoke first. \"Son of Peleus,\" said he, \"be not so exceeding\nfearful; we are two gods, come with Jove's sanction to assist you, I,\nand Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he\nwill abate presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you,\nif you will be guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting till\nyou have pent the Trojan host within the famed walls of Ilius--as many\nof them as may escape. Then kill Hector and go back to the ships, for\nwe will vouchsafe you a triumph over him.\"\n\nWhen they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but\nAchilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge the\ngods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of waters,\nand much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain was rifting\nabout, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream,\nspeeding right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for\nMinerva had endowed him with great strength. Nevertheless Scamander did\nnot slacken in his pursuit, but was still more furious with the son of\nPeleus. He lifted his waters into a high crest and cried aloud to\nSimois saying, \"Dear brother, let the two of us unite to save this man,\nor he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not\nhold out against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water\nfrom their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave\non high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we may\nmake an end of this savage creature who is now lording it as though he\nwere a god. Nothing shall serve him longer, not strength nor\ncomeliness, nor his fine armour, which forsooth shall soon be lying low\nin the deep waters covered over with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and\npour tons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how\nto gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have hidden him, and\nwhen they celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.\"\n\nOn this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,\nseething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the dead. The\ndark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the\nson of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away\nin the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to\nVulcan her son. \"Crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing,\nfor I deem it is with you that Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at\nonce, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the white\nsouth wind in a mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear the\nflames against the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume them,\nwhile you go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and wrapping\nhim round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by fair words\nnor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then you may stay\nyour flames.\"\n\nOn this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon the\nplain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and whose\nbodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the plain was\ndried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\nthat has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart of\nthe owner is glad--even so the whole plain was dried and the dead\nbodies were consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river.\nHe burned the elms the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with\nthe rushes and marshy herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the\nriver. The eels and fishes that go darting about everywhere in the\nwater, these, too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunning\nVulcan had kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spoke\nsaying, \"Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you. I cannot\nfight you when you flare out your flames in this way; strive with me no\nlonger. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of their city immediately.\nWhat have I to do with quarrelling and helping people?\"\n\nHe was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As a\ncauldron upon a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of some\nfatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the dry\nfaggots blaze under it--even so were the goodly waters of Xanthus\nheated with the fire till they were boiling. He could flow no longer\nbut stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the blasts of fire which\ncunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to Juno and besought her\nsaying, \"Juno, why should your son vex my stream with such especial\nfury? I am not so much to blame as all the others are who have been\nhelping the Trojans. I will leave off, since you so desire it, and let\nyour son leave off also. Furthermore I swear never again will I do\nanything to save the Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy\nis burning in the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.\"\n\nAs soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, \"Son Vulcan,\nhold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence against a god\nfor the sake of mortals.\"\n\nWhen she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the river went\nback once more into his own fair bed.\n\nXanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno stayed\nthem though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel broke out among\nthe other gods, for they were of divided counsels. They fell on one\nanother with a mighty uproar--earth groaned, and the spacious firmament\nrang out as with a blare of trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting on\nOlympus, and laughed for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among\nthemselves. They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer of\nshields opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon Minerva\nand reviled her. \"Why, vixen,\" said he, \"have you again set the gods by\nthe ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have you forgotten\nhow you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me, and yourself took\nvisible spear and drove it into me to the hurt of my fair body? You\nshall now suffer for what you then did to me.\"\n\nAs he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis--so terrible\nthat not even can Jove's lightning pierce it. Here did murderous Mars\nstrike her with his great spear. She drew back and with her strong hand\nseized a stone that was lying on the plain--great and rugged and\nblack--which men of old had set for the boundary of a field. With this\nshe struck Mars on the neck, and brought him down. Nine roods did he\ncover in his fall, and his hair was all soiled in the dust, while his\narmour rang rattling round him. But Minerva laughed and vaunted over\nhim saying, \"Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger I am than\nyou, but you must still match yourself against me? Thus do your\nmother's curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do you\nmischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping the\nTrojans.\"\n\nShe then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove's\ndaughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning all the\ntime, for it was only with great difficulty that he had come to himself\nagain. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to Minerva, \"Look, daughter of\naegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that vixen Venus is again taking Mars\nthrough the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\"\n\nThus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at her,\nstriking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she fell\nfainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\nlength. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, \"May all who help the\nTrojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart as\nVenus did when she came across me while she was helping Mars. Had this\nbeen so, we should long since have ended the war by sacking the strong\ncity of Ilius.\"\n\nJuno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to Apollo\nsaying, \"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm's length? it is\nnot well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will be\ndisgraceful to us if we return to Jove's bronze-floored mansion on\nOlympus without having fought each other; therefore come on, you are\nthe younger of the two, and I ought not to attack you, for I am older\nand have had more experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how\nwe two alone of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we\ncame from Jove's house and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated\nwage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall about\ntheir city, so wide and fair that it might be impregnable, while you,\nPhoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many valleyed Ida. When,\nhowever, the glad hours brought round the time of payment, mighty\nLaomedon robbed us of all our hire and sent us off with nothing but\nabuse. He threatened to bind us hand and foot and sell us over into\nsome distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut off the ears of both of\nus, so we went away in a rage, furious about the payment he had\npromised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now\nshowing favour to his people, and will not join us in compassing the\nutter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and children.\"\n\nAnd King Apollo answered, \"Lord of the earthquake, you would have no\nrespect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable\nmortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the\nfield, and presently fall lifeless to the ground. Let us stay this\nfighting at once and let them settle it among themselves.\"\n\nHe turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the brother of\nhis own father. But his sister the huntress Diana, patroness of wild\nbeasts, was very angry with him and said, \"So you would fly,\nFar-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with a cheap vaunt to\nboot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you\nbragging in my father's house, as you have often done in the presence\nof the immortals, that you would stand up and fight with Neptune.\"\n\nApollo made her no answer, but Jove's august queen was angry and\nupbraided her bitterly. \"Bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare you cross me\nthus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own against\nme. Jove made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them\nwhenever you choose. You will find it better to chase wild beasts and\ndeer upon the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you\nare. If you would try war, do so, and find out by pitting yourself\nagainst me, how far stronger I am than you are.\"\n\nShe caught both Diana's wrists with her left hand as she spoke, and\nwith her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and laughed as she\nbeat her with it about the ears while Diana wriggled and writhed under\nher blows. Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she fled\nweeping from under Juno's hand as a dove that flies before a falcon to\nthe cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape.\nEven so did she fly weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her.\n\nThen the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto, \"Leto, I\nshall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Jove's\nwives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals that you worsted\nme in fair fight.\"\n\nLeto then gathered up Diana's bow and arrows that had fallen about amid\nthe whirling dust, and when she had got them she made all haste after\nher daughter. Diana had now reached Jove's bronze-floored mansion on\nOlympus, and sat herself down with many tears on the knees of her\nfather, while her ambrosial raiment was quivering all about her. The\nson of Saturn drew her towards him, and laughing pleasantly the while\nbegan to question her saying, \"Which of the heavenly beings, my dear\nchild, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as though you had\nbeen misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and the\nfair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, \"It was your wife Juno,\nfather, who has been beating me; it is always her doing when there is\nany quarrelling among the immortals.\"\n\nThus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the strong\ncity of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out and\nthe Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour had\ncome; but the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry and\nsome triumphant to Olympus, where they took their seats beside Jove\nlord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing out death\nalike on the Trojans and on their horses. As when the smoke from some\nburning city ascends to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled\nit--there is then toil for all, and sorrow for not a few--even so did\nAchilles bring toil and sorrow on the Trojans.\n\nOld King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on huge\nAchilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and there was\nnone to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower and with\nmany a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders of\nthe gate. \"Keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the people come\nflying into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in\nrout before him. I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are\ninside and in safety, close the strong gates for I fear lest that\nterrible man should come bounding inside along with the others.\"\n\nAs he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and when\nthese were opened there was a haven of refuge for the Trojans. Apollo\nthen came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect them.\nRight for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy\nwith dust, still they fied on, with Achilles wielding his spear\nfuriously behind them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting\nafter glory.\n\nThen had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy if\nApollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. He\nput courage into his heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning\nagainst a beech tree and shrouded in thick darkness. When Agenor saw\nAchilles he stood still and his heart was clouded with care. \"Alas,\"\nsaid he to himself in his dismay, \"if I fly before mighty Achilles, and\ngo where all the others are being driven in rout, he will none the less\ncatch me and kill me for a coward. How would it be were I to let\nAchilles drive the others before him, and then fly from the wall to the\nplain that is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide\nin the underwood that is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off\nme in the river and in the evening return to Ilius. But why commune\nwith myself in this way? Like enough he would see me as I am hurrying\nfrom the city over the plain, and would speed after me till he had\ncaught me--I should stand no chance against him, for he is mightiest of\nall mankind. What, then, if I go out and meet him in front of the city?\nHis flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by pointed bronze. Life is the\nsame in one and all, and men say that he is but mortal despite the\ntriumph that Jove son of Saturn vouchsafes him.\"\n\nSo saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was now\nfain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert\nto attack a hunter--she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying\nof the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her\neither with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced her\nshe will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been\nkilled outright--even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to fly\ntill he had made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear,\nholding his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. \"Of a\ntruth,\" said he, \"noble Achilles, you deem that you shall this day sack\nthe city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be trouble enough yet\nbefore it, for there is many a brave man of us still inside who will\nstand in front of our dear parents with our wives and children, to\ndefend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be,\nhere shall you die.\"\n\nAs he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the spear\nstruck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of newly\nwrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him\nwhom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the god's gift stayed\nit. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not\nvouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a thick\nmist, sending him out of the battle unmolested. Then he craftily drew\nthe son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the\nsemblance of Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him\nto give him chase and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain,\nturning him towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran\nbut a little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think\nall the time that he was on the point of overtaking him. Meanwhile the\nrabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd within the city till\ntheir numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait for one another\noutside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were fallen in\nfight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them poured\npell-mell into the town.\n\n\n\nBOOK XXII\n\n  The death of Hector.\n\nTHUS the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat from\noff them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the goodly\nbattlements, while the Achaeans with their shields laid upon their\nshoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern fate bade Hector stay\nwhere he was before Ilius and the Scaean gates. Then Phoebus Apollo\nspoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are\nbut man, give chase to me who am immortal? Have you not yet found out\nthat it is a god whom you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the\nTrojans whom you had routed, and now they are within their walls, while\nyou have been decoyed hither away from them. Me you cannot kill, for\ndeath can take no hold upon me.\"\n\nAchilles was greatly angered and said, \"You have baulked me,\nFar-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away from the\nwall, where many another man would have bitten the dust ere he got\nwithin Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and have saved the\nTrojans at no risk to yourself, for you have nothing to fear, but I\nwould indeed have my revenge if it were in my power to do so.\"\n\nOn this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the winning\nhorse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is flying over the\nplain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs of Achilles bear him\nonwards. King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all\nradiant as the star which men call Orion's Hound, and whose beams blaze\nforth in time of harvest more brilliantly than those of any other that\nshines by night; brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill\nfor mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train--even so did\nAchilles' armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a\ncry and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted\nout to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still stayed\nbefore the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle with\nAchilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and bade him for\npity's sake come within the walls. \"Hector,\" he cried, \"my son, stay\nnot to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will meet death at\nthe hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you. Monster\nthat he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,\nfor so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on\nearth, and a load of grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a\nbrave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or selling them\naway in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons\nfrom among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and\nPolydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be\nstill alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with\ngold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed\nhis daughter richly; but if they are already dead and in the house of\nHades, sorrow will it be to us two who were their parents; albeit the\ngrief of others will be more short-lived unless you too perish at the\nhands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the city, to be the\nguardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own\nlife and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also\non your unhappy father while life yet remains to him--on me, whom the\nson of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old\nage, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as\ncaptives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed to earth\namid the rage of battle, and my sons' wives dragged away by the cruel\nhands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces\nat my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with\nsword or spear-hounds that I myself reared and fed at my own table to\nguard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all\ndistraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in battle,\nhe may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be\nseen, all is honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is\nnothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his\ngrey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.\"\n\nThe old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the heart\nof Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she bared her\nbosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him. \"Hector,\" she\ncried, weeping bitterly the while, \"Hector, my son, spurn not this\nbreast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever given you comfort\nfrom my own bosom, think on it now, dear son, and come within the wall\nto protect us from this man; stand not without to meet him. Should the\nwretch kill you, neither I nor your richly dowered wife shall ever\nweep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs\nwill devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\"\n\nThus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not\nthe heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as\nhe drew nearer towards him. As a serpent in its den upon the mountains,\nfull fed with deadly poisons, waits for the approach of man--he is\nfilled with fury and his eyes glare terribly as he goes writhing round\nhis den--even so Hector leaned his shield against a tower that jutted\nout from the wall and stood where he was, undaunted.\n\n\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, \"if I go\nwithin the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach upon me,\nfor it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the city on\nthat awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not\nlisten, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that\nmy folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan\nwomen in the face, lest a worse man should say, 'Hector has ruined us\nby his self-confidence.' Surely it would be better for me to return\nafter having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here\nbefore the city. What, again, if I were to lay down my shield and\nhelmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight up to noble\nAchilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen, who was the\nfountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that Alexandrus\nbrought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and to let the Achaeans\ndivide the half of everything that the city contains among themselves?\nI might make the Trojans, by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn\noath that they would hide nothing, but would divide into two shares all\nthat is within the city--but why argue with myself in this way? Were I\nto go up to him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me\nthen and there as easily as though I were a woman, when I had off my\narmour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree as\nyoung men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight him at\nonce, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe victory.\"\n\nThus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it were\nMars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder he\nbrandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze gleamed\naround him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising sun. Fear fell\nupon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not stay longer where he was\nbut fled in dismay from before the gates, while Achilles darted after\nhim at his utmost speed. As a mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds,\nswoops down upon some cowering dove--the dove flies before him but the\nfalcon with a shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have\nher--even so did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might,\nwhile Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take\nhim.\n\nOn they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the wall,\npast the lookout station, and past the weather-beaten wild fig-tree,\ntill they came to two fair springs which feed the river Scamander. One\nof these two springs is warm, and steam rises from it as smoke from a\nburning fire, but the other even in summer is as cold as hail or snow,\nor the ice that forms on water. Here, hard by the springs, are the\ngoodly washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the\ncoming of the Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used\nto wash their clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and\nthe other giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but\nbetter far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,\nfor the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock's hide, as it\nmight be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life of Hector.\nAs horses in a chariot race speed round the turning-posts when they are\nrunning for some great prize--a tripod or woman--at the games in honour\nof some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round\nthe city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and\nmen was the first to speak.\n\n\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being pursued\nround the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for Hector, who has\nburned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honour, one while on the\ncrests of many-valleyed Ida, and again on the citadel of Troy; and now\nI see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round the city of Priam.\nWhat say you? Consider among yourselves and decide whether we shall now\nsave him or let him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of\nPeleus.\"\n\nThen Minerva said, \"Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of cloud and\nstorm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose doom has long\nbeen decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we others\nshall not be of a mind with you.\"\n\nAnd Jove answered, \"My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not speak\nin full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do without let or\nhindrance as you are minded.\"\n\nThus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she darted\nfrom the topmost summits of Olympus.\n\nAchilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing a fawn\nwhich he has started from its covert on the mountains, and hunts\nthrough glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by crouching\nunder cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\nuntil he gets her--even so there was no escape for Hector from the\nfleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian\ngates and under the walls, that his people might help him by showering\ndown weapons from above, Achilles would gain on him and head him back\ntowards the plain, keeping himself always on the city side. As a man in\na dream who fails to lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing--the\none cannot escape nor the other overtake--even so neither could\nAchilles come up with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles;\nnevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time come\nwhen Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his\nrunning, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the\nAchaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart\nat Hector, lest another might win the glory of having hit him and he\nmight himself come in second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the\nfountains for the fourth time, the father of all balanced his golden\nscales and placed a doom in each of them, one for Achilles and the\nother for Hector. As he held the scales by the middle, the doom of\nHector fell down deep into the house of Hades--and then Phoebus Apollo\nleft him. Thereon Minerva went close up to the son of Peleus and said,\n\"Noble Achilles, favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to\nthe ships a triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his\nlust of battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his\nfather, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay here\nand take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to make a stand\nand fight you.\"\n\nThus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,\nleaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him and\nwent after Hector in the form and with the voice of Deiphobus. She came\nclose up to him and said, \"Dear brother, I see you are hard pressed by\nAchilles who is chasing you at full speed round the city of Priam, let\nus await his onset and stand on our defence.\"\n\nAnd Hector answered, \"Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to me of\nall my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but henceforth I shall\nrate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have ventured outside the\nwall for my sake when all the others remain inside.\"\n\nThen Minerva said, \"Dear brother, my father and mother went down on\ntheir knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain inside,\nso great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an agony of\ngrief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make a stand and\nfight, and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve, that we may\nlearn whether Achilles shall kill us and bear off our spoils to the\nships, or whether he shall fall before you.\"\n\nThus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two were now\nclose to one another great Hector was first to speak. \"I will no longer\nfly you, son of Peleus,\" said he, \"as I have been doing hitherto. Three\ntimes have I fled round the mighty city of Priam, without daring to\nwithstand you, but now, let me either slay or be slain, for I am in the\nmind to face you. Let us, then, give pledges to one another by our\ngods, who are the fittest witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let\nit be agreed between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and\nI take your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly\nfashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to give up\nyour body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.\"\n\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Fool, prate not to me about\ncovenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions, wolves and\nlambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other out and out all\nthrough. Therefore there can be no understanding between you and me,\nnor may there be any covenants between us, till one or other shall fall\nand glut grim Mars with his life's blood. Put forth all your strength;\nyou have need now to prove yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of\nwar. You have no more chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith\nvanquish you by my spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief\nyou have caused me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in\nbattle.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it coming and\navoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it flew over his\nhead and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then snatched it up and\ngave it back to Achilles without Hector's seeing her; Hector thereon\nsaid to the son of Peleus, \"You have missed your aim, Achilles, peer of\nthe gods, and Jove has not yet revealed to you the hour of my doom,\nthough you made sure that he had done so. You were a false-tongued liar\nwhen you deemed that I should forget my valour and quail before you.\nYou shall not drive your spear into the back of a runaway--drive it,\nshould heaven so grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight\ntowards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can--would\nthat you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were once\ndead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you who\nhave harmed them most.\"\n\nHe poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true for he\nhit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear rebounded from it,\nand did not pierce it. Hector was angry when he saw that the weapon had\nsped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no\nsecond spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobus and asked him for\none, but there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself,\n\"Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the\nhero Deiphobus was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva\nhas inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and\nthere is no way out of it--for so Jove and his son Apollo the\nfar-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready\nto protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die\ningloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great\nthing that shall be told among men hereafter.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong by his\nside, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles like a\nsoaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some lamb or\ntimid hare--even so did Hector brandish his sword and spring upon\nAchilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him, with his wondrous\nshield before his breast, and his gleaming helmet, made with four\nlayers of metal, nodding fiercely forward. The thick tresses of gold\nwith which Vulcan had crested the helmet floated round it, and as the\nevening star that shines brighter than all others through the stillness\nof night, even such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised in\nhis right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his\nfair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but all\nwas protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had spoiled\nPatroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat where the\ncollar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is a most\ndeadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as he was coming on\ntowards him, and the point of his spear went right through the fleshy\npart of the neck, but it did not sever his windpipe so that he could\nstill speak. Hector fell headlong, and Achilles vaunted over him\nsaying, \"Hector, you deemed that you should come off scatheless when\nyou were spoiling Patroclus, and recked not of myself who was not with\nhim. Fool that you were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was\nstill left behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The\nAchaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and vultures\nshall work their will upon yourself.\"\n\nThen Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, \"I pray you by your\nlife and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me at the\nships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of gold and bronze\nwhich my father and mother will offer you, and send my body home, that\nthe Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire when I am dead.\"\n\nAchilles glared at him and answered, \"Dog, talk not to me neither of\nknees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able to cut\nyour flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you have done me, as\nI am that nothing shall save you from the dogs--it shall not be, though\nthey bring ten or twenty-fold ransom and weigh it out for me on the\nspot, with promise of yet more hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus\nshould bid them offer me your weight in gold, even so your mother shall\nnever lay you out and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and\nvultures shall eat you utterly up.\"\n\nHector with his dying breath then said, \"I know you what you are, and\nwas sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard as iron;\nlook to it that I bring not heaven's anger upon you on the day when\nParis and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be, shall slay you at the\nScaean gates.\"\n\nWhen he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon his\nsoul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades, lamenting its\nsad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no longer. But\nAchilles said, speaking to the dead body, \"Die; for my part I will\naccept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods see fit to send it.\"\n\nAs he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one side;\nthen he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector's shoulders while\nthe other Achaeans came running up to view his wondrous strength and\nbeauty; and no one came near him without giving him a fresh wound. Then\nwould one turn to his neighbour and say, \"It is easier to handle Hector\nnow than when he was flinging fire on to our ships\"--and as he spoke he\nwould thrust his spear into him anew.\n\nWhen Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood among\nthe Argives and said, \"My friends, princes and counsellors of the\nArgives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome this man, who\nhas done us more hurt than all the others together, consider whether we\nshould not attack the city in force, and discover in what mind the\nTrojans may be. We should thus learn whether they will desert their\ncity now that Hector has fallen, or will still hold out even though he\nis no longer living. But why argue with myself in this way, while\nPatroclus is still lying at the ships unburied, and unmourned--he whom\nI can never forget so long as I am alive and my strength fails not?\nThough men forget their dead when once they are within the house of\nHades, yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have lost.\nNow, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory and go\nback to the ships taking this man along with us; for we have achieved a\nmighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to whom the Trojans prayed\nthroughout their city as though he were a god.\"\n\nOn this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced the\nsinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and passed\nthongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he made the body\nfast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon the ground. Then when\nhe had put the goodly armour on the chariot and had himself mounted, he\nlashed his horses on and they flew forward nothing loth. The dust rose\nfrom Hector as he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all\nabroad, and his head once so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had\nnow delivered him into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his\nown land.\n\nThus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His mother\ntore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry as she\nlooked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and throughout the\ncity the people fell to weeping and wailing. It was as though the whole\nof frowning Ilius was being smirched with fire. Hardly could the people\nhold Priam back in his hot haste to rush without the gates of the city.\nHe grovelled in the mire and besought them, calling each one of them by\nhis name. \"Let be, my friends,\" he cried, \"and for all your sorrow,\nsuffer me to go single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me\nbeseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the\nfeeling of his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own\nfather is even such another as myself--Peleus, who bred him and reared\nhim to be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all\nothers. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his youth, and\nyet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one--Hector--more than for\nthem all, and the bitterness of my sorrow will bring me down to the\nhouse of Hades. Would that he had died in my arms, for so both his\nill-starred mother who bore him, and myself, should have had the\ncomfort of weeping and mourning over him.\"\n\nThus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city\njoined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among the\nTrojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live for now\nthat you are no more? Night and day did I glory in you throughout the\ncity, for you were a tower of strength to all in Troy, and both men and\nwomen alike hailed you as a god. So long as you lived you were their\npride, but now death and destruction have fallen upon you.\"\n\nHector's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to tell her\nthat her husband had remained without the gates. She was at her loom in\nan inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\nembroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large\ntripod on the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hector when he\ncame out of battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the\nreach of baths, and that Minerva had laid him low by the hands of\nAchilles. She heard the cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in\nevery limb; the shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her\nwaiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me that I may learn\nwhat it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my husband's\nhonoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would come into my\nmouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for\nPriam's children must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I\ngreatly fear that Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hector and\nhas chased him on to the plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may\nhave put an end to the reckless daring which possessed my husband, who\nwould never remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in\nfront, foremost of them all in valour.\"\n\nHer heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house like a\nmaniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she reached the\nbattlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\nwall, and saw Hector being borne away in front of the city--the horses\ndragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of\nthe Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night\nand she fell fainting backwards. She tore the attiring from her head\nand flung it from her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and\nthe veil which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took\nher with him from the house of Eetion, after having given countless\ngifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband's sisters and the wives of\nhis brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was fain to\ndie in her distraction; when she again presently breathed and came to\nherself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans saying, \"Woe is\nme, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were born, you\nat Troy in the house of Priam, and I at Thebes under the wooded\nmountain of Placus in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was\na child--ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter--would that he had\nnever begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the\nsecret places of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your\nhouse. The child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet\na mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing for\nhim nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this woeful\nwar with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labour\nand sorrow, for others will seize his lands. The day that robs a child\nof his parents severs him from his own kind; his head is bowed, his\ncheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about destitute among the\nfriends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and another by the\nshirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold the\ncup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must\nnot drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents\nare alive will drive him from the table with blows and angry words.\n'Out with you,' he will say, 'you have no father here,' and the child\nwill go crying back to his widowed mother--he, Astyanax, who erewhile\nwould sit upon his father's knees, and have none but the daintiest and\nchoicest morsels set before him. When he had played till he was tired\nand went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, on\na soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now that he has\nlost his father his lot will be full of hardship--he, whom the Trojans\nname Astyanax, because you, O Hector, were the only defence of their\ngates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at\nthe ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves\nupon you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and\ngoodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of\nno use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus you will have\nrespect shown you by the Trojans both men and women.\"\n\nIn such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in\nher lament.\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIII\n\n  The funeral of Patroclus, and the funeral games.\n\nThus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the Achaeans\nwhen they reached the Hellespont went back every man to his own ship.\nBut Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave\ncomrades saying, \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends,\nnot yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near\nto the body and mourn Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we\nhave had full comfort of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take\nsupper all of us here.\"\n\nOn this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them in\ntheir lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round\nthe body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning. The\nsands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with their weeping,\nso great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief in all\ntheir mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on\nthe breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in\nthe house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I\nwill drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons\nof Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you.\"\n\nAs he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely, laying\nit at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus. The others\nthen put off every man his armour, took the horses from their chariots,\nand seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the fleet\ndescendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral\nbanquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they\nbutcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did\nthey singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets of\nblood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.\n\nThen the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to Agamemnon,\nbut hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so wroth was he\nfor the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon's tent\nthey told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case\nthey might persuade the son of Peleus to wash the clotted gore from\nthis body, but he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath,\nsaying, \"Nay, by King Jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not\nmeet that water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the\nflames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head--for so long as I\nlive no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. Now, therefore, let\nus do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King\nAgamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and provide all else that the dead\nmay duly take into the realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him\nout of our sight the sooner, and the people shall turn again to their\nown labours.\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made haste to\nprepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full share so that\nall were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\nthe others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of\nPeleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding\nsea, in an open place where the waves came surging in one after\nanother. Here a very deep slumber took hold upon him and eased the\nburden of his sorrows, for his limbs were weary with chasing Hector\nround windy Ilius. Presently the sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him,\nlike what he had been in stature, voice, and the light of his beaming\neyes, clad, too, as he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over\nhis head and said--\n\n\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living, but\nnow that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with all speed\nthat I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain shadows of men\nthat can labour no more, drive me away from them; they will not yet\nsuffer me to join those that are beyond the river, and I wander all\ndesolate by the wide gates of the house of Hades. Give me now your hand\nI pray you, for when you have once given me my dues of fire, never\nshall I again come forth out of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we\nsit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which\nwas my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me--nay, you too\nAchilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the noble\nTrojans.\n\n\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not my\nbones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even as we\nwere brought up together in your own home, what time Menoetius brought\nme to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\nthe son of Amphidamas--not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over\nthe dice. The knight Peleus took me into his house, entreated me\nkindly, and named me to be your squire; therefore let our bones lie in\nbut a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you by your\nmother.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you come hither to lay\nthese charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you have bidden\nme. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our arms around one\nanother, and find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows.\"\n\nHe opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped him\nin them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a vapour,\ngibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to his feet,\nsmote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even in\nthe house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms that have no life in\nthem; all night long the sad spirit of Patroclus has hovered over head\nmaking piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and looking\nwondrously like himself.\"\n\nThus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning about\nthe poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then King\nAgamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to bring wood,\nand Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went\nout with woodmen's axes and strong ropes in their hands, and before\nthem went the mules. Up hill and down dale did they go, by straight\nways and crooked, and when they reached the heights of many-fountained\nIda, they laid their axes to the roots of many a tall branching oak\nthat came thundering down as they felled it. They split the trees and\nbound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best\ncould through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been\ncutting wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden\nthem, and they threw them down in a line upon the seashore at the place\nwhere Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for\nhimself.\n\nWhen they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole\nground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles ordered\nhis brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke each man his\nhorses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour and mounted each\nhis chariot--they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went\nbefore, and they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of\nthousands after. In the midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and\ncovered him with the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw\nupon his body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so\nnoble a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.\n\nWhen they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they laid\nthe body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought him of\nanother matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut off the\nyellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheius. He looked\nall sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and said, \"Spercheius, in vain\ndid my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned home to my loved\nnative land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb;\nfifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs, where\nis your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my\nfather vow, but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that\nI shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero\nPatroclus.\"\n\nAs he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade, and\nall who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation. The sun\nwould have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles presently\nsaid to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\nwill give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from\nmourning; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their\ndinners: we, to whom the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted\nhere, and let the other princes also stay by me.\"\n\nWhen King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their ships,\nbut those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built a pyre a\nhundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all sorrowfully\nupon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\nbefore the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the\nbody therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcases all round\nit. Against the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents;\nfour proud horses did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he\ndid so. The dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay\nand threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\nto the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full of bitterness\nand fury. Then he committed all to the resistless and devouring might\nof the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by name.\n\"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroclus, even in the house of Hades; I am now\ndoing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans\nshall the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall\ndevour the flesh of Hector son of Priam.\"\n\nThus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of Hector, for\nJove's daughter Venus kept them off him night and day, and anointed him\nwith ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be torn when\nAchilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\ncloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where\nHector lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body.\n\nNow the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles therefore\nbethought him of another matter; he went apart and prayed to the two\nwinds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly offerings. He made them\nmany drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come and\nhelp him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies\nbe consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the\nwinds. They were holding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus\nwhen Iris came running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood\nthere, but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her\nand each of them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. \"I\ncannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to the streams of Oceanus and\nthe land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the immortals,\nand I would have my share; but Achilles prays that Boreas and shrill\nZephyrus will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings; he would\nhave you blow upon the pyre of Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are\nlamenting.\"\n\nWith this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that rent\nthe air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and on until\nthey came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath them, but when\nthey reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the mighty flames roared\nunder the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard and\nbeat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double\ncup, drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the\nspirit of dead Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the\nearth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of\nhis bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,\neven so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,\npacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.\n\nAt length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light which\nsaffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the flames fell\nand the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the Thracian\nsea, which roared and boiled as they swept over it. The son of Peleus\nnow turned away from the pyre and lay down, overcome with toil, till he\nfell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who were about the son of\nAtreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of\ntheir coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus, and all other\nprinces of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire\nand quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus son of\nMenoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found, for they\nlie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has\nbeen thrown in a heap and burned at the outer edge. We will lay the\nbones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat, against the time when I\nshall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for the barrow, labour\nnot to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable. Afterwards,\nlet those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I am gone, build\nit both broad and high.\"\n\nThus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus. First they\npoured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and quenched the fire.\nWith many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their loved\ncomrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they\nthen covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent.\nThey marked off the circle where the barrow should be, made a\nfoundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth.\nWhen they had thus raised a mound they were going away, but Achilles\nstayed the people and made them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from\nthe ships--cauldrons, tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with\nfair girdles, and swart iron.\n\nThe first prize he offered was for the chariot races--a woman skilled\nin all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had ears for\nhandles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man who\ncame in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken,\nand in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that\nhad never yet been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the\nmaker, and would hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents\nof gold, and the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then\nhe stood up and spoke among the Argives saying--\n\n\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that lie\nwaiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I should\ncarry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you know how far\nmy steeds excel all others--for they are immortal; Neptune gave them to\nmy father Peleus, who in his turn gave them to myself; but I shall hold\naloof, I and my steeds that have lost their brave and kind driver, who\nmany a time has washed them in clear water and anointed their manes\nwith oil. See how they stand weeping here, with their manes trailing on\nthe ground in the extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set\nyourselves in order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in\nhis horses and in the strength of his chariot.\"\n\nThus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots bestirred\nthemselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king of men, son of\nAdmetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to him rose mighty\nDiomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken\nfrom Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him,\nyellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses,\nAgamemnon's mare Aethe, and his own horse Podargus. The mare had been\ngiven to Agamemnon by Echepolus son of Anchises, that he might not have\nto follow him to Ilius, but might stay at home and take his ease; for\nJove had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon.\nThis mare, all eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke.\n\nFourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus, made\nready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father came up to\nhim to give him good advice of which, however, he stood in but little\nneed. \"Antilochus,\" said Nestor, \"you are young, but Jove and Neptune\nhave loved you well, and have made you an excellent horseman. I need\nnot therefore say much by way of instruction. You are skilful at\nwheeling your horses round the post, but the horses themselves are very\nslow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other\ndrivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore,\nmy dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you may\ninsure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. The woodman\ndoes more by skill than by brute force; by skill the pilot guides his\nstorm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by skill one driver can beat\nanother. If a man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a man\nwho knows what he is doing may have worse horses, but he will keep them\nwell in hand when he sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise\nmoment at which to pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in\nfront of him. I will give you this certain token which cannot escape\nyour notice. There is a stump of a dead tree--oak or pine as it may\nbe--some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it\nstands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones set one on each\nside, and there is a clear course all round it. It may have been a\nmonument to some one long since dead, or it may have been used as a\ndoubling-post in days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by\nAchilles as the mark round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as\nclose as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little\nto the left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and\ngive him a loose rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in,\nthat the nave of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the\nstone, or you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,\nwhich would be sport for others but confusion for yourself. Therefore,\nmy dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you can be first to\nround the post there is no chance of any one giving you the go-by\nlater, not even though you had Adrestus's horse Arion behind you--a\nhorse which is of divine race--or those of Laomedon, which are the\nnoblest in this country.\"\n\nWhen Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in his\nplace, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They then all\nmounted their chariots and cast lots. Achilles shook the helmet, and\nthe lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first; next came that of\nKing Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus son of Atreus and of\nMeriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomed son of Tydeus, who\nwas the best man of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles\nshowed them the doubling-post round which they were to turn, some way\noff upon the plain; here he stationed his father's follower Phoenix as\numpire, to note the running, and report truly.\n\nAt the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck them\nwith the reins, and shouted at them with all their might. They flew\nfull speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust rose from under\nthem as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their manes were all flying\nin the wind. At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, and\nthen again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and\ntheir hearts beat fast and furious in their lust of victory. Each kept\ncalling on his horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds\nof dust that they raised.\n\nIt was when they were doing the last part of the course on their way\nback towards the sea that their pace was strained to the utmost and it\nwas seen what each could do. The horses of the descendant of Pheres now\ntook the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of\nDiomed. They seemed as if about to mount Eumelus's chariot, and he\ncould feel their warm breath on his back and on his broad shoulders,\nfor their heads were close to him as they flew over the course. Diomed\nwould have now passed him, or there would have been a dead heat, but\nPhoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell\nfrom his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while his\nown horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva saw the\ntrick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought him his\nwhip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son of\nAdmetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to one\nside of the course, and the other to the other, and the pole was broken\nagainst the ground. Eumelus was thrown from his chariot close to the\nwheel; his elbows, mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead\nwas bruised above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could\nfind no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and\nshot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and covered\nDiomed himself with glory.\n\nMenelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus called to\nhis father's horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried, \"and do your very\nutmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of Tydeus,\nfor Minerva has put running into them, and has covered Diomed with\nglory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be\nleft behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good\nfellows, are you lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely be--Nestor\nwill keep neither of you, but will put both of you to the sword, if we\nwin any the worse a prize through your carelessness. Fly after them at\nyour utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow\npart of the way, and it shall not fail me.\"\n\nThey feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space went\nquicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the road had\nsunk. The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered and had\nworn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaus was making\ntowards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but Antilochus\nturned his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one\nside. The son of Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilochus, you\nare driving recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow\nhere, it will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my\nchariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.\"\n\nBut Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had not\nheard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young man can\nhurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his strength, and then\nMenelaus's mares drew behind, for he left off driving for fear the\nhorses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while\npressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the\nground. Menelaus then upbraided Antilochus and said, \"There is no\ngreater trickster living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you;\nthe Achaeans say not well that you have understanding, and come what\nmay you shall not bear away the prize without sworn protest on my part.\"\n\nThen he called on his horses and said to them, \"Keep your pace, and\nslacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner than\nyours, for they are neither of them young.\"\n\nThe horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so that\nthey were soon nearly up with the others.\n\nMeanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the horses\nwent, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own dust.\nIdomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the running, for\nhe was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding\npart of the ground. The driver was a long way off, but Idomeneus could\nhear him shouting, and could see the foremost horse quite plainly--a\nchestnut with a round white star, like the moon, on its forehead. He\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and\ncounsellors of the Argives, can you see the running as well as I can?\nThere seems to be another pair in front now, and another driver; those\nthat led off at the start must have been disabled out on the plain. I\nsaw them at first making their way round the doubling-post, but now,\nthough I search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the\nreins fell from the driver's hand so that he lost command of his horses\nat the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have\nbeen thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have\nleft the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for\nyourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the driver seems an\nAetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives, brave Diomed the son of\nTydeus.\"\n\nAjax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, \"Idomeneus, why\nshould you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when the mares\nare still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the youngest, nor\nyour eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down the law.\nYou have no right to do so, for there are better men here than you are.\nEumelus's horses are in front now, as they always have been, and he is\non the chariot holding the reins.\"\n\nThe captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, \"Ajax you are an\nexcellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting in much\nelse as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager you a tripod or\ncauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall decide whose horses are\nfirst. You will then know to your cost.\"\n\nAjax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there would\nhave been yet further brawling between them, had not Achilles risen in\nhis place and said, \"Cease your railing, Ajax and Idomeneus; it is not\nseemly; you would be scandalised if you saw any one else do the like:\nsit down and keep your eyes on the horses; they are speeding towards\nthe winning-post and will be here directly. You will then both of you\nknow whose horses are first, and whose come after.\"\n\nAs he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his whip\nlustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as they flew\nover the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the driver, and the\nchariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet horses.\nThere was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses\ncame flying in at their utmost speed. Diomed stayed them in the middle\nof the crowd, and the sweat from their manes and chests fell in streams\non to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and\nleaned his whip against his horses' yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no\ntime, but at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the\near-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he unyoked the\nhorses.\n\nNext after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had passed\nMenelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so\nMenelaus came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that\ndraws both the chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's tail\ntouch the tyre of the wheel, and there is never much space between\nwheel and horse when the chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than\nthis behind Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc's throw\nbehind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon's mare Aethe\nkept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course had been\nlonger he would have passed him, and there would not even have been a\ndead heat. Idomeneus's brave squire Meriones was about a spear's cast\nbehind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of all, and he was the worst\ndriver. Last of them all came the son of Admetus, dragging his chariot\nand driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,\nand stood up among the Argives saying, \"The best man is coming in last.\nLet us give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second,\nbut the first must go to the son of Tydeus.\"\n\nThus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his saying, and\nwere for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son Antilochus stood up and\nclaimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\" said he, \"I\nshall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of my\nprize, because you think Eumelus's chariot and horses were thrown out,\nand himself too, good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the\nimmortals; he would not have come in last if he had done so. If you are\nsorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents, with\nbronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this store if you\nwould have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize\neven than that which you have now offered; but I will not give up the\nmare, and he that will fight me for her, let him come on.\"\n\nAchilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with Antilochus, who\nwas one of his dearest comrades. So he said--\n\n\"Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I will\ngive him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running all round it\nwhich I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much money to him.\"\n\nHe bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his tent, and\nhe did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who received it\ngladly.\n\nBut Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus. An\nattendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives keep\nsilence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilochus,\" said he, \"what is\nthis from you who have been so far blameless? You have made me cut a\npoor figure and baulked my horses by flinging your own in front of\nthem, though yours are much worse than mine are; therefore, O princes\nand counsellors of the Argives, judge between us and show no favour,\nlest one of the Achaeans say, 'Menelaus has got the mare through lying\nand corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilochus's, but he\nhas greater weight and influence.' Nay, I will determine the matter\nmyself, and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come\nhere, Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your\nchariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by\nearth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and guilefully get\nin the way of my horses.\"\n\nAnd Antilochus answered, \"Forgive me; I am much younger, King Menelaus,\nthan you are; you stand higher than I do and are the better man of the\ntwo; you know how easily young men are betrayed into indiscretion;\ntheir tempers are more hasty and they have less judgement; make due\nallowances therefore, and bear with me; I will of my own accord give up\nthe mare that I have won, and if you claim any further chattel from my\nown possessions, I would rather yield it to you, at once, than fall\nfrom your good graces henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.\"\n\nThe son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to Menelaus,\nwhose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a field of\nripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the harvest--even so, O\nMenelaus, was your heart made glad within you. He turned to Antilochus\nand said, \"Now, Antilochus, angry though I have been, I can give way to\nyou of my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor\nill-disposed hitherto, but this time your youth has got the better of\nyour judgement; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no\none else could have brought me round so easily, but your good father,\nyour brother, and yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my\nbehalf; I therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare\nto you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am\nneither harsh nor vindictive.\"\n\nWith this he gave the mare over to Antilochus's comrade Noemon, and\nthen took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth, carried off\nthe two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the two-handled urn,\nbeing unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor, going up to him among the\nassembled Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend, as an\nheirloom and memorial of the funeral of Patroclus--for you shall see\nhim no more among the Argives. I give you this prize though you cannot\nwin one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for\nthe javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid\nheavily upon you.\"\n\nSo saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly and\nanswered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there is no strength\nnow in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from either\nshoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\nwere burying King Amarynceus in Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes\nin his honour. There was then none that could vie with me neither of\nthe Epeans nor the Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I\novercame Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron\nwho had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I beat\nhim, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or Polydorus.\nIn chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor surpass me by\ncrowding their horses in front of me, for they were angry at the way\nvictory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in\nthe place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one\nkept on holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied\nthe whip. Such was I then, but now I must leave these matters to\nyounger men; I must bow before the weight of years, but in those days I\nwas eminent among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests\nin honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart\nrejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill\ntowards you, and of the respect due to me from the Achaeans. For all\nwhich may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you in great abundance.\"\n\nThereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks of\nNestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently\noffered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing. He brought out a\nstrong mule, and made it fast in the middle of the crowd--a she-mule\nnever yet broken, but six years old--when it is hardest of all to break\nthem: this was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a\ndouble cup. Then he stood up and said among the Argives, \"Son of\nAtreus, and all other Achaeans, I invite our two champion boxers to lay\nabout them lustily and compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo\nvouchsafes the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as\nvictor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while he\nthat is vanquished shall have the double cup.\"\n\nAs he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great stature,\na skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his hand on the mule\nand said, \"Let the man who is to have the cup come hither, for none but\nmyself will take the mule. I am the best boxer of all here present, and\nnone can beat me. Is it not enough that I should fall short of you in\nactual fighting? Still, no man can be good at everything. I tell you\nplainly, and it shall come true; if any man will box with me I will\nbruise his body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay\nhere in a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done with\nhim.\"\n\nThey all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of\nMecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes after\nthe fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people\nof Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus's second, cheering him on and\nhoping heartily that he would win. First he put a waistband round him\nand then he gave him some well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being\nnow girt went into the middle of the ring, and immediately fell to;\nheavily indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with\ntheir brawny fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws,\nand they sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came on\nand gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round; Euryalus\ncould not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a moment and he\nsprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the air near some shore\nthat is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the top of the\nwaves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeus caught hold\nof him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him\nfrom the ring, unsteady in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and\nspitting great clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then\nwent to fetch the double cup.\n\nThe son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third contest and\nshowed them to the Argives. These were for the painful art of\nwrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod ready for setting\nupon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among themselves at twelve\noxen. For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\narts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\n\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty Ulysses,\nfull of wiles, rose also. The two girded themselves and went into the\nmiddle of the ring. They gripped each other in their strong hands like\nthe rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of a high\nhouse to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they tugged at\none another with their mighty arms--and sweat rained from them in\ntorrents. Many a bloody weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders,\nbut they kept on striving with might and main for victory and to win\nthe tripod. Ulysses could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too\nstrong for him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of watching them,\nAjax said to Ulysses, \"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either\nlift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between us.\"\n\nHe lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not forget\nhis cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his knee, so that he\ncould not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Ulysses lying upon\nhis chest, and all who saw it marvelled. Then Ulysses in turn lifted\nAjax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift him\nright off it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on\nthe ground and were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one\nanother and were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and\nstayed them. \"Put not each other further,\" said he, \"to such cruel\nsuffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an equal\nprize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.\"\n\nThus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on their\nshirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.\n\nThe son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running--a\nmixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold six\nmeasures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it\nwas the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had been brought into\nport by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who had made a present of it\nto Thoas. Eueneus son of Jason had given it to Patroclus in ransom of\nPriam's son Lycaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize in honour of\nhis comrade to him who should be the swiftest runner. For the second\nprize he offered a large ox, well fattened, while for the last there\nwas to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said among the\nArgives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest.\"\n\nForthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses, and\nNestor's son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the youth of his\ntime. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal. The\ncourse was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of\nOileus took the lead at once, with Ulysses as close behind him as the\nshuttle is to a woman's bosom when she throws the woof across the warp\nand holds it close up to her; even so close behind him was\nUlysses--treading in his footprints before the dust could settle there,\nand Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran\nswiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining\nhis utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were\nnow nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to Minerva.\n\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray,\nand Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet\nfeel light, and when the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the\nprize, Ajax, through Minerva's spite slipped upon some offal that was\nlying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in honour of\nPatroclus, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung.\nUlysses therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax\nand came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on one\nof its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said to the\nArgives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over\nUlysses and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\" Thus did\nhe speak and they all of them laughed heartily.\n\nAntilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to the\nbystanders, \"You all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown\ntheir respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as\nfor Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier generation, but he is hale in\nspite of his years, and no man of the Achaeans can run against him save\nonly Achilles.\"\n\nHe said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and Achilles\nanswered, \"Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to no purpose; I\nshall give you an additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave the\nhalf talent to Antilochus, who received it gladly.\n\nThen the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield that\nhad been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroclus. He\nstood up and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put on their\narmour, take their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the\npresence of the multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh\nof the other, cut through his armour, and draw blood, to him will I\ngive this goodly Thracian sword inlaid with silver, which I took from\nAsteropaeus, but the armour let both hold in partnership, and I will\ngive each of them a hearty meal in my own tent.\"\n\nForthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty Diomed\nson of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on his own side\nof the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and with\nfire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marvelled as they beheld\nthem, and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did\nthey spring forward and thrice try to strike each other in close\ncombat. Ajax pierced Diomed's round shield, but did not draw blood, for\nthe cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus\nfrom over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax's neck with\nthe point of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade\nthem leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles\nthen gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and\nthe leathern belt with which to hang it.\n\nAchilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion had\nerewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and carried it\noff in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and said among\nthe Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest. He who\nwins it will have a store of iron that will last him five years as they\ngo rolling round, and if his fair fields lie far from a town his\nshepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to buy iron, for\nhe will have a stock of it on his own premises.\"\n\nThen uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax son\nof Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other and Epeus\ntook the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which set all the\nAchaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Mars. Ajax\nson of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark that had\nbeen made yet, but when mighty Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it\nas though it had been a stockman's stick which he sends flying about\namong his cattle when he is driving them, so far did his throw\nout-distance those of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and\nhis comrades carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.\n\nAchilles next offered a prize of iron for archery--ten double-edged\naxes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship's mast, some way off\nupon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it by the foot;\nthis was what they were to aim at. \"Whoever,\" he said, \"can hit the\npigeon shall have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hits\nthe string without hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and\nshall have the single-edged axes.\"\n\nThen uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of Idomeneus\nrose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell\nfirst. He let fly with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise\nhecatombs of firstling lambs to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for\nApollo foiled his aim; but he hit the string with which the bird was\ntied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string clean through so that it\nhung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and\nthe Achaeans shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while\nTeucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once\npromised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to\nApollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the\nclouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling\nupwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself in the\nground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perched on the ship's mast\nhanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the life went out\nof her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore, took\nall ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones\nto his ships.\n\nThen the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had never\nbeen on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of\nflowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up--to wit the son of\nAtreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of\nIdomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we know how far\nyou excel all others both in power and in throwing the javelin; take\nthe cauldron back with you to your ships, but if it so please you, let\nus give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I should myself\nwish.\"\n\nKing Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and\nhanded the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIV\n\n  Priam ransoms the body of Hector--Hector's funeral.\n\nTHE assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to his\nown ship. There they made ready their supper, and then bethought them\nof the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still wept for thinking of\nhis dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all things bow, could take no\nhold upon him. This way and that did he turn as he yearned after the\nmight and manfulness of Patroclus; he thought of all they had done\ntogether, and all they had gone through both on the field of battle and\non the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept\nbitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now face\ndownwards, till at last he rose and went out as one distraught to\nwander upon the seashore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach\nand sea, he yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body of\nHector behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag it\nround the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into his\ntent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its face\ndownwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured, for he\npitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he shielded him with\nhis golden aegis continually, that he might take no hurt while Achilles\nwas dragging him.\n\nThus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but the\nblessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged Mercury, slayer\nof Argus, to steal the body. All were of this mind save only Juno,\nNeptune, and Jove's grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in the hate which\nthey had ever borne towards Ilius with Priam and his people; for they\nforgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in disdaining the\ngoddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring\nher who had offered him a wanton to his ruin.\n\nWhen, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come, Phoebus\nApollo spoke among the immortals saying, \"You gods ought to be ashamed\nof yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did not Hector burn you\nthigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished goats? And now dare you not\nrescue even his dead body, for his wife to look upon, with his mother\nand child, his father Priam, and his people, who would forthwith commit\nhim to the flames, and give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you\nwould all be on the side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor\nruth? He is like some savage lion that in the pride of his great\nstrength and daring springs upon men's flocks and gorges on them. Even\nso has Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience which at\nonce so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed it. A man\nmay lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost--a son, it may be, or a\nbrother born from his own mother's womb; yet when he has mourned him\nand wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes much sorrow to\nkill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has slain noble Hector, drags\nhim behind his chariot round the tomb of his comrade. It were better of\nhim, and for him, that he should not do so, for brave though he be we\ngods may take it ill that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.\"\n\nJuno spoke up in a rage. \"This were well,\" she cried, \"O lord of the\nsilver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to Achilles;\nbut Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman's breast, whereas Achilles\nis the offspring of a goddess whom I myself reared and brought up. I\nmarried her to Peleus, who is above measure dear to the immortals; you\ngods came all of you to her wedding; you feasted along with them\nyourself and brought your lyre--false, and fond of low company, that\nyou have ever been.\"\n\nThen said Jove, \"Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not be\nequal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to the gods,\nas also to myself, for his offerings never failed me. Never was my\naltar stinted of its dues, nor of the drink-offerings and savour of\nsacrifice which we claim of right. I shall therefore permit the body of\nmighty Hector to be stolen; and yet this may hardly be without Achilles\ncoming to know it, for his mother keeps night and day beside him. Let\nsome one of you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will impart my\ncounsel to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom from Priam,\nand give up the body.\"\n\nOn this Iris fleet as the wind went forth to carry his message. Down\nshe plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky Imbrus;\nthe waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank into the bottom\nas the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is sped to carry death to\nfishes. She found Thetis sitting in a great cave with the other\nsea-goddesses gathered round her; there she sat in the midst of them\nweeping for her noble son who was to fall far from his own land, on the\nrich plains of Troy. Iris went up to her and said, \"Rise Thetis; Jove,\nwhose counsels fail not, bids you come to him.\" And Thetis answered,\n\"Why does the mighty god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink\nfrom going in and out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the\nword that he may speak shall not be spoken in vain.\"\n\nThe goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe more\nsombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way before her. The\nwaves of the sea opened them a path, and when they reached the shore\nthey flew up into the heavens, where they found the all-seeing son of\nSaturn with the blessed gods that live for ever assembled near him.\nMinerva gave up her seat to her, and she sat down by the side of father\nJove. Juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to her\nin words of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup;\nand the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.\n\n\"So, goddess,\" said he, \"for all your sorrow, and the grief that I well\nknow reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to Olympus, and I\nwill tell you why I have sent for you. This nine days past the\nimmortals have been quarrelling about Achilles waster of cities and the\nbody of Hector. The gods would have Mercury slayer of Argus steal the\nbody, but in furtherance of our peace and amity henceforward, I will\nconcede such honour to your son as I will now tell you. Go, then, to\nthe host and lay these commands upon him; say that the gods are angry\nwith him, and that I am myself more angry than them all, in that he\nkeeps Hector at the ships and will not give him up. He may thus fear me\nand let the body go. At the same time I will send Iris to great Priam\nto bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and ransom his son, taking\nwith him such gifts for Achilles as may give him satisfaction.\"\n\nSilver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith down\nshe darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to her son's\ntents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his trusty comrades\nround him were busy preparing their morning meal, for which they had\nkilled a great woolly sheep. His mother sat down beside him and\ncaressed him with her hand saying, \"My son, how long will you keep on\nthus grieving and making moan? You are gnawing at your own heart, and\nthink neither of food nor of woman's embraces; and yet these too were\nwell, for you have no long time to live, and death with the strong hand\nof fate are already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I say,\nfor I come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are angry\nwith you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep Hector\nat the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him go, and accept\na ransom for his body.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own motion\nthus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the body away.\"\n\nThus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long discourse\nwith one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris to the strong\ncity of Ilius. \"Go,\" said he, \"fleet Iris, from the mansions of\nOlympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to go to the ships of\nthe Achaeans and free the body of his dear son. He is to take such\ngifts with him as shall give satisfaction to Achilles, and he is to go\nalone, with no other Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may\ndrive his mules and waggon, and bring back the body of him whom noble\nAchilles has slain. Let him have no thought nor fear of death in his\nheart, for we will send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring\nhim within the tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let\nanother do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he\nwill entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"\n\nOn this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her message. She\nwent to Priam's house, and found weeping and lamentation therein. His\nsons were seated round their father in the outer courtyard, and their\nraiment was wet with tears: the old man sat in the midst of them with\nhis mantle wrapped close about his body, and his head and neck all\ncovered with the filth which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in\nthe mire. His daughters and his sons' wives went wailing about the\nhouse, as they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain by\nthe Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to\nhim, but fear fell upon him as she did so. \"Take heart,\" she said,\n\"Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I bring no evil\ntidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as a messenger from\nJove, who though he be not near, takes thought for you and pities you.\nThe lord of Olympus bids you go and ransom noble Hector, and take with\nyou such gifts as shall give satisfaction to Achilles. You are to go\nalone, with no Trojan, save only some honoured servant who may drive\nyour mules and waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whom\nnoble Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of\ndeath, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When he\nhas brought you within Achilles' tent, Achilles will not kill you nor\nlet another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and\nhe will entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.\"\n\nIris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his sons to\nget a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the waggon fast upon\nthe top of its bed. Then he went down into his fragrant store-room,\nhigh-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where his many treasures were\nkept, and he called Hecuba his wife. \"Wife,\" said he, \"a messenger has\ncome to me from Olympus, and has told me to go to the ships of the\nAchaeans to ransom my dear son, taking with me such gifts as shall give\nsatisfaction to Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own\npart I am greatly moved to pass through the camps of the Achaeans and\ngo to their ships.\"\n\nHis wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, \"Alas, what has become\nof that judgement for which you have been ever famous both among\nstrangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to the ships\nof the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has slain so many of\nyour brave sons? You must have iron courage, for if the cruel savage\nsees you and lays hold on you, he will know neither respect nor pity.\nLet us then weep Hector from afar here in our own house, for when I\ngave him birth the threads of overruling fate were spun for him that\ndogs should eat his flesh far from his parents, in the house of that\nterrible man on whose liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus\nwould I avenge my son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him,\nand thought neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood in\ndefence of Trojan men and Trojan women.\"\n\nThen Priam said, \"I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as a bird\nof ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it been some\nmortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who divines from\nsacrifice--I should have deemed him false and have given him no heed;\nbut now I have heard the goddess and seen her face to face, therefore I\nwill go and her saying shall not be in vain. If it be my fate to die at\nthe ships of the Achaeans even so would I have it; let Achilles slay\nme, if I may but first have taken my son in my arms and mourned him to\nmy heart's comforting.\"\n\nSo saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve goodly\nvestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs,\ntwelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts. He weighed out ten\ntalents of gold, and brought moreover two burnished tripods, four\ncauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which the Thracians had given him\nwhen he had gone to them on an embassy; it was very precious, but he\ngrudged not even this, so eager was he to ransom the body of his son.\nThen he chased all the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with\nwords of anger. \"Out,\" he cried, \"shame and disgrace to me that you\nare. Have you no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague me\nhere? Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent\nthis sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you shall\nprove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will have easier\nwork in killing you. As for me, let me go down within the house of\nHades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting of the city.\"\n\nHe drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the old\nman sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding Helenus, Paris,\nnoble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the loud battle-cry,\nDeiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did the old man call near\nhim. \"Come to me at once,\" he cried, \"worthless sons who do me shame;\nwould that you had all been killed at the ships rather than Hector.\nMiserable man that I am, I have had the bravest sons in all Troy--noble\nNestor, Troilus the dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was a god\namong men, so that one would have thought he was son to an\nimmortal--yet there is not one of them left. Mars has slain them and\nthose of whom I am ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot,\nheroes of the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people,\nwhy do you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these\nthings upon it that I may set out on my way?\"\n\nThus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father. They\nbrought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the body of the\nwaggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from the peg on which\nit hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the top of it and rings for\nthe reins to go through. Then they brought a yoke-band eleven cubits\nlong, to bind the yoke to the pole; they bound it on at the far end of\nthe pole, and put the ring over the upright pin making it fast with\nthree turns of the band on either side the knob, and bending the thong\nof the yoke beneath it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber\nthe rich ransom that was to purchase the body of Hector, and they set\nit all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong harness-mules\nwhich the Mysians had on a time given as a goodly present to Priam; but\nfor Priam himself they yoked horses which the old king had bred, and\nkept for his own use.\n\nThus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of their\ncars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful, with a\ngolden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might make a\ndrink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of the horses\nand said, \"Take this, make a drink-offering to father Jove, and since\nyou are minded to go to the ships in spite of me, pray that you may\ncome safely back from the hands of your enemies. Pray to the son of\nSaturn lord of the whirlwind, who sits on Ida and looks down over all\nTroy, pray him to send his swift messenger on your right hand, the bird\nof omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you\nmay see it with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships\nof the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,\nhowever set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the ships of\nthe Argives.\"\n\nAnd Priam answered, \"Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well to\nlift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon me.\"\n\nWith this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over his\nhands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He washed his\nhands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the drink-offering\nand prayed, standing in the middle of the courtyard and turning his\neyes to heaven. \"Father Jove,\" he said, \"that rulest from Ida, most\nglorious and most great, grant that I may be received kindly and\ncompassionately in the tents of Achilles; and send your swift messenger\nupon my right hand, the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear\nto you of all birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as\nI go forth to the ships of the Danaans.\"\n\nSo did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer.\nForthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all birds that\nfly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black Eagle. His wings\nwere spread abroad on either side as wide as the well-made and\nwell-bolted door of a rich man's chamber. He came to them flying over\nthe city upon their right hands, and when they saw him they were glad\nand their hearts took comfort within them. The old man made haste to\nmount his chariot, and drove out through the inner gateway and under\nthe echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Before him went the mules\ndrawing the four-wheeled waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind\nthese were the horses, which the old man lashed with his whip and drove\nswiftly through the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and\nlamenting for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as\nthey had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons\nand sons-in-law who had followed him went back to Ilius.\n\nBut Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not escape\nthe ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old man and pitied\nhim; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said, \"Mercury, for it is you\nwho are the most disposed to escort men on their way, and to hear those\nwhom you will hear, go, and so conduct Priam to the ships of the\nAchaeans that no other of the Danaans shall see him nor take note of\nhim until he reach the son of Peleus.\"\n\nThus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as\nhe was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with\nwhich he could fly like the wind over land and sea; he took the wand\nwith which he seals men's eyes in sleep, or wakes them just as he\npleases, and flew holding it in his hand till he came to Troy and to\nthe Hellespont. To look at, he was like a young man of noble birth in\nthe hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his\nface.\n\nNow when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of Ilius, they\nstayed their mules and horses that they might drink in the river, for\nthe shades of night were falling, when, therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury\nstanding near them he said to Priam, \"Take heed, descendant of\nDardanus; here is matter which demands consideration. I see a man who I\nthink will presently fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at\nleast embrace his knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?\"\n\nWhen he heard this the old man's heart failed him, and he was in great\nfear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair stood on end\nover his whole body; but the bringer of good luck came up to him and\ntook him by the hand, saying, \"Whither, father, are you thus driving\nyour mules and horses in the dead of night when other men are asleep?\nAre you not afraid of the fierce Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel\nand relentless? Should some one of them see you bearing so much\ntreasure through the darkness of the flying night, what would not your\nstate then be? You are no longer young, and he who is with you is too\nold to protect you from those who would attack you. For myself, I will\ndo you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for you remind\nme of my own father.\"\n\nAnd Priam answered, \"It is indeed as you say, my dear son; nevertheless\nsome god has held his hand over me, in that he has sent such a wayfarer\nas yourself to meet me so opportunely; you are so comely in mien and\nfigure, and your judgement is so excellent that you must come of\nblessed parents.\"\n\nThen said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, all that you\nhave said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you taking this\nrich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it may be safe, or\nare you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now that your son has fallen\nwho was the bravest man among you and was never lacking in battle with\nthe Achaeans?\"\n\nAnd Priam said, \"Who are you, my friend, and who are your parents, that\nyou speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy son?\"\n\nThe slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, \"Sir, you would\nprove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a time have I\nset eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the Argives to their\nships and putting them to the sword. We stood still and marvelled, for\nAchilles in his anger with the son of Atreus suffered us not to fight.\nI am his squire, and came with him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon,\nand my father's name is Polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as\nyou are; he has six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast\nlots, and it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come\nfrom the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will set\nbattle in array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing, and are so\neager that their princes cannot hold them back.\"\n\nThen answered Priam, \"If you are indeed the squire of Achilles son of\nPeleus, tell me now the whole truth. Is my son still at the ships, or\nhas Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him to his hounds?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"neither hounds\nnor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying at the tents\nby the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve days that he has\nlain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the worms eaten him\nalthough they feed on warriors. At daybreak Achilles drags him cruelly\nround the sepulchre of his dear comrade, but it does him no hurt. You\nshould come yourself and see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood\nall washed away, and his wounds every one of them closed though many\npierced him with their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of\nyour brave son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.\"\n\nThe old man was comforted as he heard him and said, \"My son, see what a\ngood thing it is to have made due offerings to the immortals; for as\nsure as that he was born my son never forgot the gods that hold\nOlympus, and now they requite it to him even in death. Accept therefore\nat my hands this goodly chalice; guard me and with heaven's help guide\nme till I come to the tent of the son of Peleus.\"\n\nThen answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, \"Sir, you are\ntempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move me, for\nyou are offering me presents without the knowledge of Achilles whom I\nfear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest some evil presently\nbefall me; but as your guide I would go with you even to Argos itself,\nand would guard you so carefully whether by sea or land, that no one\nshould attack you through making light of him who was with you.\"\n\nThe bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and seizing the\nwhip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the mules and horses. When\nthey reached the trench and the wall that was before the ships, those\nwho were on guard had just been getting their suppers, and the slayer\nof Argus threw them all into a deep sleep. Then he drew back the bolts\nto open the gates, and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon\nhis waggon. Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of\nPeleus for which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built\nfor their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse\ntussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round it\nthey made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set close\ntogether. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine which it took\nthree men to force into its place, and three to draw back so as to open\nthe gate, but Achilles could draw it by himself. Mercury opened the\ngate for the old man, and brought in the treasure that he was taking\nwith him for the son of Peleus. Then he sprang from the chariot on to\nthe ground and said, \"Sir, it is I, immortal Mercury, that am come with\nyou, for my father sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and\nwill not enter into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him\nthat a god should befriend mortal men thus openly. Go you within, and\nembrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by his father, his\nlovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.\"\n\nWith these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang from\nhis chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in charge of\nthe mules and horses. The old man went straight into the house where\nAchilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There he found him with his\nmen seated at a distance from him: only two, the hero Automedon, and\nAlcimus of the race of Mars, were busy in attendance about his person,\nfor he had but just done eating and drinking, and the table was still\nthere. King Priam entered without their seeing him, and going right up\nto Achilles he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands\nthat had slain so many of his sons.\n\nAs when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have killed\nsome one in his own country, and must fly to a great man's protection\nin a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him, even so did\nAchilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked one to another\nand marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles saying, \"Think of your\nfather, O Achilles like unto the gods, who is such even as I am, on the\nsad threshold of old age. It may be that those who dwell near him\nharass him, and there is none to keep war and ruin from him. Yet when\nhe hears of you being still alive, he is glad, and his days are full of\nhope that he shall see his dear son come home to him from Troy; but I,\nwretched man that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my sons, and\nthere is not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the Achaeans came\nhere; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others were\nborne to me by the women of my household. The greater part of them has\nfierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone left, him who was\nthe guardian of the city and ourselves, him have you lately slain;\ntherefore I am now come to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom his body\nfrom you with a great ransom. Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven;\nthink on your own father and have compassion upon me, who am the more\npitiable, for I have steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled\nhimself before me, and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew\nmy son.\"\n\nThus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he bethought him\nof his father. He took the old man's hand and moved him gently away.\nThe two wept bitterly--Priam, as he lay at Achilles' feet, weeping for\nHector, and Achilles now for his father and now for Patroclus, till the\nhouse was filled with their lamentation. But when Achilles was now\nsated with grief and had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he\nleft his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white\nhair and beard; then he said, \"Unhappy man, you have indeed been\ngreatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the\nAchaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your\nbrave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for\nall our grief we will hide our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will\nnot avail us. The immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man\nis full of sorrow; on the floor of Jove's palace there stand two urns,\nthe one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for\nwhom Jove the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now\nwith good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but\nevil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of\nfamine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and\ndown the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. Even so\ndid it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him with all good things from\nhis birth upwards, for he reigned over the Myrmidons excelling all men\nin prosperity and wealth, and mortal though he was they gave him a\ngoddess for his bride. But even on him too did heaven send misfortune,\nfor there is no race of royal children born to him in his house, save\none son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may I take care of him\nnow that he is growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane\nof you and your children. And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you\nwere aforetime happy. They say that in wealth and plenitude of\noffspring you surpassed all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar to\nthe northward, Phrygia that is more inland, and those that dwell upon\nthe great Hellespont; but from the day when the dwellers in heaven sent\nthis evil upon you, war and slaughter have been about your city\ncontinually. Bear up against it, and let there be some intervals in\nyour sorrow. Mourn as you may for your brave son, you will take nothing\nby it. You cannot raise him from the dead, ere you do so yet another\nsorrow shall befall you.\"\n\nAnd Priam answered, \"O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector is\nstill lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great ransom\nwhich I have brought you, and give him to me at once that I may look\nupon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach your own land in\nsafety, seeing that you have suffered me to live and to look upon the\nlight of the sun.\"\n\nAchilles looked at him sternly and said, \"Vex me, sir, no longer; I am\nof myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother, daughter of\nthe old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid me deliver it to\nyou. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you cannot hide it, that some\ngod has brought you to the ships of the Achaeans, for else, no man\nhowever strong and in his prime would dare to come to our host; he\ncould neither pass our guard unseen, nor draw the bolt of my gates thus\neasily; therefore, provoke me no further, lest I sin against the word\nof Jove, and suffer you not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.\"\n\nThe old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang like a\nlion through the door of his house, not alone, but with him went his\ntwo squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to him than any\nothers of his comrades now that Patroclus was no more. These unyoked\nthe horses and mules, and bade Priam's herald and attendant be seated\nwithin the house. They lifted the ransom for Hector's body from the\nwaggon, but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt, that Achilles\nmight wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home. Then he\ncalled to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,\nbut he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it, lest if\nhe did so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and\nenrage Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word of\nJove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and had\nwrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself lifted it on to\na bier, and he and his men then laid it on the waggon. He cried aloud\nas he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade, \"Be not angry\nwith me, Patroclus,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the house of Hades\nthat I have given Hector to his father for a ransom. It has been no\nunworthy one, and I will share it equitably with you.\"\n\nAchilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the richly\ninlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was at right\nangles to the one against which Priam was sitting. \"Sir,\" he said,\n\"your son is now laid upon his bier and is ransomed according to\ndesire; you shall look upon him when you take him away at daybreak; for\nthe present let us prepare our supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think\nabout eating, though her twelve children--six daughters and six lusty\nsons--had been all slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with\narrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the\ndaughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said\nLeto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne\nmany--whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie\nweltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn\nturned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in heaven\nthemselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being worn out with\nweeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on the mountain\npastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that haunt the river\nAchelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses the\nsorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir, let\nus two now take food; you can weep for your dear son hereafter as you\nare bearing him back to Ilius--and many a tear will he cost you.\"\n\nWith this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery\nwhiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order.\nThey cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, and\ndrew them off again when they were well roasted. Automedon brought\nbread in fair baskets and served it round the table, while Achilles\ndealt out the meat, and they laid their hands on the good things that\nwere before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,\nPriam, descendant of Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty of\nAchilles for he was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at Priam as\nhe listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When they had\ngazed their fill Priam spoke first. \"And now, O king,\" he said, \"take\nme to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of\nsleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day your hands took\nthe life of my son; I have grovelled without ceasing in the mire of my\nstable-yard, making moan and brooding over my countless sorrows. Now,\nmoreover, I have eaten bread and drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted\nnothing.\"\n\nAs he spoke Achilles told his men and the women-servants to set beds in\nthe room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with good red rugs,\nand spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Priam\nand Idaeus to wear. So the maids went out carrying a torch and got the\ntwo beds ready in all haste. Then Achilles said laughingly to Priam,\n\"Dear sir, you shall lie outside, lest some counsellor of those who in\ndue course keep coming to advise with me should see you here in the\ndarkness of the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon. This might\ncause delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me and tell me\ntrue, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of noble\nHector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and restrain the host.\"\n\nAnd Priam answered, \"Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble son\nwith all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be grateful. You\nknow how we are pent up within our city; it is far for us to fetch wood\nfrom the mountain, and the people live in fear. Nine days, therefore,\nwill we mourn Hector in my house; on the tenth day we will bury him and\nthere shall be a public feast in his honour; on the eleventh we will\nbuild a mound over his ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, we\nwill fight.\"\n\nAnd Achilles answered, \"All, King Priam, shall be as you have said. I\nwill stay our fighting for as long a time as you have named.\"\n\nAs he spoke he laid his hand on the old man's right wrist, in token\nthat he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his attendant\nsleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while Achilles lay in an\ninner room of the house, with fair Briseis by his side.\n\nAnd now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong\nnight, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck, sleep could\ntake no hold for he was thinking all the time how to get King Priam\naway from the ships without his being seen by the strong force of\nsentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam's head and said, \"Sir, now\nthat Achilles has spared your life, you seem to have no fear about\nsleeping in the thick of your foes. You have paid a great ransom, and\nhave received the body of your son; were you still alive and a prisoner\nthe sons whom you have left at home would have to give three times as\nmuch to free you; and so it would be if Agamemnon and the other\nAchaeans were to know of your being here.\"\n\nWhen he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.\nMercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly\nthrough the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to the\nford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury went back\nto high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to break over all\nthe land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward the city lamenting and\nmaking moan, and the mules drew the body of Hector. No one neither man\nnor woman saw them, till Cassandra, fair as golden Venus standing on\nPergamus, caught sight of her dear father in his chariot, and his\nservant that was the city's herald with him. Then she saw him that was\nlying upon the bier, drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went\nabout the city saying, \"Come hither Trojans, men and women, and look on\nHector; if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he was\nalive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all our\npeople.\"\n\nAt this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a sorrow\nhad possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he was bringing\nin the body. Hector's wife and his mother were the first to mourn him:\nthey flew towards the waggon and laid their hands upon his head, while\nthe crowd stood weeping round them. They would have stayed before the\ngates, weeping and lamenting the livelong day to the going down of the\nsun, had not Priam spoken to them from the chariot and said, \"Make way\nfor the mules to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the body home\nyou shall have your fill of weeping.\"\n\nOn this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon. When\nthey had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a bed and\nseated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the women joined\nin the sad music of their lament. Foremost among them all Andromache\nled their wailing as she clasped the head of mighty Hector in her\nembrace. \"Husband,\" she cried, \"you have died young, and leave me in\nyour house a widow; he of whom we are the ill-starred parents is still\na mere child, and I fear he may not reach manhood. Ere he can do so our\ncity will be razed and overthrown, for you who watched over it are no\nmore--you who were its saviour, the guardian of our wives and children.\nOur women will be carried away captives to the ships, and I among them;\nwhile you, my child, who will be with me will be put to some unseemly\ntasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be, some Achaean will hurl\nyou (O miserable death) from our walls, to avenge some brother, son, or\nfather whom Hector slew; many of them have indeed bitten the dust at\nhis hands, for your father's hand in battle was no light one. Therefore\ndo the people mourn him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to\nyour parents, and my own grief is greatest of all, for you did not\nstretch forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me\nany words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day for\nevermore.\"\n\nBitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her lament.\nHecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. \"Hector,\" she cried,\n\"dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were alive the gods\nloved you well, and even in death they have not been utterly unmindful\nof you; for when Achilles took any other of my sons, he would sell him\nbeyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or rugged Lemnos; and when he had\nslain you too with his sword, many a time did he drag you round the\nsepulchre of his comrade--though this could not give him life--yet here\nyou lie all fresh as dew, and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with\nhis painless shafts.\"\n\nThus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and then\nHelen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation. \"Hector,\"\nsaid she, \"dearest of all my brothers-in-law--for I am wife to\nAlexandrus who brought me hither to Troy--would that I had died ere he\ndid so--twenty years are come and gone since I left my home and came\nfrom over the sea, but I have never heard one word of insult or\nunkindness from you. When another would chide with me, as it might be\none of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives, or my\nmother-in-law--for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own\nfather--you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and\ngoodwill. Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self,\nfor there is no one else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and\nshudder as they go by me.\"\n\nShe wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round her\njoined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, \"Bring\nwood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the\nArgives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships gave me his\nword that they should not attack us until the morning of the twelfth\nday.\"\n\nForthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together before\nthe city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps of wood, and on\nthe morning of the tenth day with many tears they took brave Hector\nforth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the fire\nthereto. Then when the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared\non the eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of\nmighty Hector. When they were got together, they first quenched the\nfire with wine wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and\ncomrades with many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them\nin soft robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which they\nplaced in a grave and covered over with large stones set close\ntogether. Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard on\nevery side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had\nfinished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again into\nthe city, and being well assembled they held high feast in the house of\nPriam their king.\n\nThus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of horses.", "title": "The Iliad"}
