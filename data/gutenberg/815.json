{"summary": "The primary focus of Democracy in America is an analysis of why republican representative democracy has succeeded in the United States while failing in so many other places. Tocqueville seeks to apply the functional aspects of democracy in the United States to what he sees as the failings of democracy in his native France.\nTocqueville speculates on the future of democracy in the United States, discussing possible threats to democracy and possible dangers of democracy. These include his belief that democracy has a tendency to degenerate into \"soft despotism\" as well as the risk of developing a tyranny of the majority. He observes that the strong role religion played in the United States was due to its separation from the government, a separation all parties found agreeable. He contrasts this to France where there was what he perceived to be an unhealthy antagonism between democrats and the religious, which he relates to the connection between church and state. Tocqueville also outlines the possible excesses of passion for equality among men, foreshadowing the totalitarian states of the twentieth century.\nInsightful analysis of political society was supplemented in the second volume by description of civil society as a sphere of private and civilian affairs.\nTocqueville observed that social mechanisms have paradoxes, like in what later became known as the Tocqueville effect: \"social frustration increases as social conditions improve\". He wrote that this growing hatred of social privilege, as social conditions improve, leads to the state concentrating more power to itself.\nTocqueville's views on the United States took a darker turn after 1840, however, as made evident in Aurelian Craiutu's Tocqueville on America after 1840: Letters and Other Writings.\n\n", "full_text": "DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA\n\nBy Alexis De Tocqueville\n\n\nTranslated by Henry Reeve\n\n\n\n\nBook One\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpecial Introduction By Hon. John T. Morgan\n\nIn the eleven years that separated the Declaration of the Independence\nof the United States from the completion of that act in the ordination\nof our written Constitution, the great minds of America were bent upon\nthe study of the principles of government that were essential to the\npreservation of the liberties which had been won at great cost and with\nheroic labors and sacrifices. Their studies were conducted in view of\nthe imperfections that experience had developed in the government of the\nConfederation, and they were, therefore, practical and thorough.\n\nWhen the Constitution was thus perfected and established, a new form of\ngovernment was created, but it was neither speculative nor experimental\nas to the principles on which it was based. If they were true\nprinciples, as they were, the government founded upon them was destined\nto a life and an influence that would continue while the liberties it\nwas intended to preserve should be valued by the human family. Those\nliberties had been wrung from reluctant monarchs in many contests,\nin many countries, and were grouped into creeds and established in\nordinances sealed with blood, in many great struggles of the people.\nThey were not new to the people. They were consecrated theories, but\nno government had been previously established for the great purpose of\ntheir preservation and enforcement. That which was experimental in our\nplan of government was the question whether democratic rule could be so\norganized and conducted that it would not degenerate into license and\nresult in the tyranny of absolutism, without saving to the people the\npower so often found necessary of repressing or destroying their enemy,\nwhen he was found in the person of a single despot.\n\nWhen, in 1831, Alexis de Tocqueville came to study Democracy in America,\nthe trial of nearly a half-century of the working of our system had been\nmade, and it had been proved, by many crucial tests, to be a government\nof \"liberty regulated by law,\" with such results in the development of\nstrength, in population, wealth, and military and commercial power, as\nno age had ever witnessed.\n\n[See Alexis De Tocqueville]\n\nDe Tocqueville had a special inquiry to prosecute, in his visit to\nAmerica, in which his generous and faithful soul and the powers of his\ngreat intellect were engaged in the patriotic effort to secure to the\npeople of France the blessings that Democracy in America had ordained\nand established throughout nearly the entire Western Hemisphere. He had\nread the story of the French Revolution, much of which had been recently\nwritten in the blood of men and women of great distinction who were\nhis progenitors; and had witnessed the agitations and terrors of the\nRestoration and of the Second Republic, fruitful in crime and sacrifice,\nand barren of any good to mankind.\n\nHe had just witnessed the spread of republican government through all\nthe vast continental possessions of Spain in America, and the loss of\nher great colonies. He had seen that these revolutions were accomplished\nalmost without the shedding of blood, and he was filled with anxiety to\nlearn the causes that had placed republican government, in France, in\nsuch contrast with Democracy in America.\n\nDe Tocqueville was scarcely thirty years old when he began his studies\nof Democracy in America. It was a bold effort for one who had no special\ntraining in government, or in the study of political economy, but he\nhad the example of Lafayette in establishing the military foundation of\nthese liberties, and of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton,\nall of whom were young men, in building upon the Independence of the\nUnited States that wisest and best plan of general government that was\never devised for a free people.\n\nHe found that the American people, through their chosen representatives\nwho were instructed by their wisdom and experience and were supported\nby their virtues--cultivated, purified and ennobled by self-reliance and\nthe love of God--had matured, in the excellent wisdom of their counsels,\na new plan of government, which embraced every security for their\nliberties and equal rights and privileges to all in the pursuit of\nhappiness. He came as an honest and impartial student and his great\ncommentary, like those of Paul, was written for the benefit of all\nnations and people and in vindication of truths that will stand for\ntheir deliverance from monarchical rule, while time shall last.\n\nA French aristocrat of the purest strain of blood and of the most\nhonorable lineage, whose family influence was coveted by crowned heads;\nwho had no quarrel with the rulers of the nation, and was secure\nagainst want by his inherited estates; was moved by the agitations\nthat compelled France to attempt to grasp suddenly the liberties and\nhappiness we had gained in our revolution and, by his devout love\nof France, to search out and subject to the test of reason the\nbasic principles of free government that had been embodied in our\nConstitution. This was the mission of De Tocqueville, and no mission\nwas ever more honorably or justly conducted, or concluded with greater\neclat, or better results for the welfare of mankind.\n\nHis researches were logical and exhaustive. They included every phase of\nevery question that then seemed to be apposite to the great inquiry he\nwas making.\n\nThe judgment of all who have studied his commentaries seems to have been\nunanimous, that his talents and learning were fully equal to his task.\nHe began with the physical geography of this country, and examined the\ncharacteristics of the people, of all races and conditions, their social\nand religious sentiments, their education and tastes; their industries,\ntheir commerce, their local governments, their passions and prejudices,\nand their ethics and literature; leaving nothing unnoticed that might\nafford an argument to prove that our plan and form of government was\nor was not adapted especially to a peculiar people, or that it would be\nimpracticable in any different country, or among any different people.\n\nThe pride and comfort that the American people enjoy in the great\ncommentaries of De Tocqueville are far removed from the selfish\nadulation that comes from a great and singular success. It is the\nconsciousness of victory over a false theory of government which has\nafflicted mankind for many ages, that gives joy to the true American, as\nit did to De Tocqueville in his great triumph.\n\nWhen De Tocqueville wrote, we had lived less than fifty years under our\nConstitution. In that time no great national commotion had occurred that\ntested its strength, or its power of resistance to internal strife, such\nas had converted his beloved France into fields of slaughter torn by\ntempests of wrath.\n\nHe had a strong conviction that no government could be ordained that\ncould resist these internal forces, when, they are directed to its\ndestruction by bad men, or unreasoning mobs, and many then believed, as\nsome yet believe, that our government is unequal to such pressure, when\nthe assault is thoroughly desperate.\n\nHad De Tocqueville lived to examine the history of the United States\nfrom 1860 to 1870, his misgivings as to this power of self-preservation\nwould, probably, have been cleared off. He would have seen that, at\nthe end of the most destructive civil war that ever occurred, when\nanimosities of the bitterest sort had banished all good feeling from\nthe hearts of our people, the States of the American Union, still in\ncomplete organization and equipped with all their official entourage,\naligned themselves in their places and took up the powers and duties of\nlocal government in perfect order and without embarrassment. This would\nhave dispelled his apprehensions, if he had any, about the power of the\nUnited States to withstand the severest shocks of civil war. Could he\nhave traced the further course of events until they open the portals of\nthe twentieth century, he would have cast away his fears of our\nability to restore peace, order, and prosperity, in the face of any\ndifficulties, and would have rejoiced to find in the Constitution of the\nUnited States the remedy that is provided for the healing of the nation.\n\nDe Tocqueville examined, with the care that is worthy the importance\nof the subject, the nature and value of the system of \"local\nself-government,\" as we style this most important feature of our plan,\nand (as has often happened) when this or any subject has become a matter\nof anxious concern, his treatment of the questions is found to have been\nmasterly and his preconceptions almost prophetic.\n\nWe are frequently indebted to him for able expositions and true\ndoctrines relating to subjects that have slumbered in the minds of the\npeople until they were suddenly forced on our attention by unexpected\nevents.\n\nIn his introductory chapter, M. De Tocqueville says: \"Amongst the novel\nobjects that attracted my attention during my stay in the United\nStates, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general equality of\nconditions.\" He referred, doubtless, to social and political conditions\namong the people of the white race, who are described as \"We, the\npeople,\" in the opening sentence of the Constitution. The last three\namendments of the Constitution have so changed this, that those who were\nthen negro slaves are clothed with the rights of citizenship, including\nthe right of suffrage. This was a political party movement, intended to\nbe radical and revolutionary, but it will, ultimately, react because it\nhas not the sanction of public opinion.\n\nIf M. De Tocqueville could now search for a law that would negative this\nprovision in its effect upon social equality, he would fail to find it.\nBut he would find it in the unwritten law of the natural aversion of the\nraces. He would find it in public opinion, which is the vital force in\nevery law in a free government. This is a subject that our Constitution\nfailed to regulate, because it was not contemplated by its authors. It\nis a question that will settle itself, without serious difficulty. The\nequality in the suffrage, thus guaranteed to the negro race, alone--for\nit was not intended to include other colored races--creates a new phase\nof political conditions that M. De Tocqueville could not foresee.\nYet, in his commendation of the local town and county governments,\nhe applauds and sustains that elementary feature of our political\norganization which, in the end, will render harmless this wide departure\nfrom the original plan and purpose of American Democracy. \"Local\nSelf-Government,\" independent of general control, except for general\npurposes, is the root and origin of all free republican government, and\nis the antagonist of all great political combinations that threaten the\nrights of minorities. It is the public opinion formed in the independent\nexpressions of towns and other small civil districts that is the\nreal conservatism of free government. It is equally the enemy of that\ndangerous evil, the corruption of the ballot-box, from which it is now\napprehended that one of our greatest troubles is to arise.\n\nThe voter is selected, under our laws, because he has certain physical\nqualifications--age and sex. His disqualifications, when any are\nimposed, relate to his education or property, and to the fact that he\nhas not been convicted of crime. Of all men he should be most directly\namenable to public opinion.\n\nThe test of moral character and devotion to the duties of good\ncitizenship are ignored in the laws, because the courts can seldom deal\nwith such questions in a uniform and satisfactory way, under rules that\napply alike to all. Thus the voter, selected by law to represent himself\nand four other non-voting citizens, is often a person who is unfit for\nany public duty or trust. In a town government, having a small area of\njurisdiction, where the voice of the majority of qualified voters is\nconclusive, the fitness of the person who is to exercise that high\nrepresentative privilege can be determined by his neighbors and\nacquaintances, and, in the great majority of cases, it will be decided\nhonestly and for the good of the country. In such meetings, there is\nalways a spirit of loyalty to the State, because that is loyalty to\nthe people, and a reverence for God that gives weight to the duties and\nresponsibilities of citizenship.\n\nM. De Tocqueville found in these minor local jurisdictions the\ntheoretical conservatism which, in the aggregate, is the safest reliance\nof the State. So we have found them, in practice, the true protectors\nof the purity of the ballot, without which all free government will\ndegenerate into absolutism.\n\nIn the future of the Republic, we must encounter many difficult and\ndangerous situations, but the principles established in the Constitution\nand the check upon hasty or inconsiderate legislation, and upon\nexecutive action, and the supreme arbitrament of the courts, will be\nfound sufficient for the safety of personal rights, and for the safety\nof the government, and the prophetic outlook of M. De Tocqueville will\nbe fully realized through the influence of Democracy in America. Each\nsucceeding generation of Americans will find in the pure and impartial\nreflections of De Tocqueville a new source of pride in our institutions\nof government, and sound reasons for patriotic effort to preserve\nthem and to inculcate their teachings. They have mastered the power of\nmonarchical rule in the American Hemisphere, freeing religion from all\nshackles, and will spread, by a quiet but resistless influence,\nthrough the islands of the seas to other lands, where the appeals of\nDe Tocqueville for human rights and liberties have already inspired the\nsouls of the people.\n\n\n\n\nHon. John T. Morgan\n\nSpecial Introduction By Hon. John J. Ingalls\n\nNearly two-thirds of a century has elapsed since the appearance of\n\"Democracy in America,\" by Alexis Charles Henri Clerel de Tocqueville, a\nFrench nobleman, born at Paris, July 29, 1805.\n\nBred to the law, he exhibited an early predilection for philosophy and\npolitical economy, and at twenty-two was appointed judge-auditor at the\ntribunal of Versailles.\n\nIn 1831, commissioned ostensibly to investigate the penitentiary system\nof the United States, he visited this country, with his friend, Gustave\nde Beaumont, travelling extensively through those parts of the Republic\nthen subdued to settlement, studying the methods of local, State, and\nnational administration, and observing the manners and habits, the daily\nlife, the business, the industries and occupations of the people.\n\n\"Democracy in America,\" the first of four volumes upon \"American\nInstitutions and their Influence,\" was published in 1835. It was\nreceived at once by the scholars and thinkers of Europe as a profound,\nimpartial, and entertaining exposition of the principles of popular,\nrepresentative self-government.\n\nNapoleon, \"The mighty somnambulist of a vanished dream,\" had abolished\nfeudalism and absolutism, made monarchs and dynasties obsolete, and\nsubstituted for the divine right of kings the sovereignty of the people.\n\nAlthough by birth and sympathies an aristocrat, M. de Tocqueville\nsaw that the reign of tradition and privilege at last was ended. He\nperceived that civilization, after many bloody centuries, had entered a\nnew epoch. He beheld, and deplored, the excesses that had attended the\ngenesis of the democratic spirit in France, and while he loved liberty,\nhe detested the crimes that had been committed in its name. Belonging\nneither to the class which regarded the social revolution as an\ninnovation to be resisted, nor to that which considered political\nequality the universal panacea for the evils of humanity, he resolved\nby personal observation of the results of democracy in the New World\nto ascertain its natural consequences, and to learn what the nations of\nEurope had to hope or fear from its final supremacy.\n\nThat a youth of twenty-six should entertain a design so broad and bold\nimplies singular intellectual intrepidity. He had neither model\nnor precedent. The vastness and novelty of the undertaking increase\nadmiration for the remarkable ability with which the task was performed.\n\nWere literary excellence the sole claim of \"Democracy in America\" to\ndistinction, the splendor of its composition alone would entitle it to\nhigh place among the masterpieces of the century. The first chapter,\nupon the exterior form of North America, as the theatre upon which the\ngreat drama is to be enacted, for graphic and picturesque description\nof the physical characteristics of the continent is not surpassed\nin literature: nor is there any subdivision of the work in which the\nseverest philosophy is not invested with the grace of poetry, and the\ndriest statistics with the charm of romance. Western emigration seemed\ncommonplace and prosaic till M. de Tocqueville said, \"This gradual and\ncontinuous progress of the European race toward the Rocky Mountains has\nthe solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising\nunabatedly, and daily driven onward by the hand of God!\"\n\nThe mind of M. de Tocqueville had the candor of the photographic camera.\nIt recorded impressions with the impartiality of nature. The image was\nsometimes distorted, and the perspective was not always true, but he\nwas neither a panegyrist, nor an advocate, nor a critic. He observed\nAmerican phenomena as illustrations, not as proof nor arguments; and\nalthough it is apparent that the tendency of his mind was not wholly\nfavorable to the democratic principle, yet those who dissent from his\nconclusions must commend the ability and courage with which they are\nexpressed.\n\nThough not originally written for Americans, \"Democracy in America\" must\nalways remain a work of engrossing and constantly increasing interest to\ncitizens of the United States as the first philosophic and comprehensive\nview of our society, institutions, and destiny. No one can rise even\nfrom the most cursory perusal without clearer insight and more patriotic\nappreciation of the blessings of liberty protected by law, nor without\nencouragement for the stability and perpetuity of the Republic. The\ncauses which appeared to M. de Tocqueville to menace both, have gone.\nThe despotism of public opinion, the tyranny of majorities, the absence\nof intellectual freedom which seemed to him to degrade administration\nand bring statesmanship, learning, and literature to the level of the\nlowest, are no longer considered. The violence of party spirit has\nbeen mitigated, and the judgment of the wise is not subordinated to the\nprejudices of the ignorant.\n\nOther dangers have come. Equality of conditions no longer exists.\nProphets of evil predict the downfall of democracy, but the student\nof M. de Tocqueville will find consolation and encouragement in the\nreflection that the same spirit which has vanquished the perils of\nthe past, which he foresaw, will be equally prepared for the\nresponsibilities of the present and the future.\n\nThe last of the four volumes of M. de Tocqueville's work upon American\ninstitutions appeared in 1840.\n\nIn 1838 he was chosen member of the Academy of Moral and Political\nSciences. In 1839 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. He became\na member of the French Academy in 1841. In 1848 he was in the Assembly,\nand from June 2nd to October 31st he was Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nThe coup d'etat of December 2, 1851 drove him from the public service.\nIn 1856 he published \"The Old Regime and the Revolution.\" He died at\nCannes, April 15, 1859, at the age of fifty-four.\n\nHon. John J. Ingalls\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory Chapter\n\nAmongst the novel objects that attracted my attention during my stay\nin the United States, nothing struck me more forcibly than the general\nequality of conditions. I readily discovered the prodigious influence\nwhich this primary fact exercises on the whole course of society, by\ngiving a certain direction to public opinion, and a certain tenor to\nthe laws; by imparting new maxims to the governing powers, and peculiar\nhabits to the governed. I speedily perceived that the influence of this\nfact extends far beyond the political character and the laws of the\ncountry, and that it has no less empire over civil society than over\nthe Government; it creates opinions, engenders sentiments, suggests the\nordinary practices of life, and modifies whatever it does not produce.\nThe more I advanced in the study of American society, the more I\nperceived that the equality of conditions is the fundamental fact from\nwhich all others seem to be derived, and the central point at which all\nmy observations constantly terminated.\n\nI then turned my thoughts to our own hemisphere, where I imagined that\nI discerned something analogous to the spectacle which the New World\npresented to me. I observed that the equality of conditions is daily\nprogressing towards those extreme limits which it seems to have reached\nin the United States, and that the democracy which governs the American\ncommunities appears to be rapidly rising into power in Europe. I hence\nconceived the idea of the book which is now before the reader.\n\nIt is evident to all alike that a great democratic revolution is\ngoing on amongst us; but there are two opinions as to its nature and\nconsequences. To some it appears to be a novel accident, which as such\nmay still be checked; to others it seems irresistible, because it is the\nmost uniform, the most ancient, and the most permanent tendency which is\nto be found in history. Let us recollect the situation of France seven\nhundred years ago, when the territory was divided amongst a small number\nof families, who were the owners of the soil and the rulers of\nthe inhabitants; the right of governing descended with the family\ninheritance from generation to generation; force was the only means by\nwhich man could act on man, and landed property was the sole source of\npower. Soon, however, the political power of the clergy was founded, and\nbegan to exert itself: the clergy opened its ranks to all classes, to\nthe poor and the rich, the villein and the lord; equality penetrated\ninto the Government through the Church, and the being who as a serf must\nhave vegetated in perpetual bondage took his place as a priest in the\nmidst of nobles, and not infrequently above the heads of kings.\n\nThe different relations of men became more complicated and more numerous\nas society gradually became more stable and more civilized. Thence the\nwant of civil laws was felt; and the order of legal functionaries soon\nrose from the obscurity of the tribunals and their dusty chambers, to\nappear at the court of the monarch, by the side of the feudal barons in\ntheir ermine and their mail. Whilst the kings were ruining themselves\nby their great enterprises, and the nobles exhausting their resources\nby private wars, the lower orders were enriching themselves by commerce.\nThe influence of money began to be perceptible in State affairs. The\ntransactions of business opened a new road to power, and the financier\nrose to a station of political influence in which he was at once\nflattered and despised. Gradually the spread of mental acquirements, and\nthe increasing taste for literature and art, opened chances of success\nto talent; science became a means of government, intelligence led to\nsocial power, and the man of letters took a part in the affairs of the\nState. The value attached to the privileges of birth decreased in the\nexact proportion in which new paths were struck out to advancement. In\nthe eleventh century nobility was beyond all price; in the thirteenth\nit might be purchased; it was conferred for the first time in 1270;\nand equality was thus introduced into the Government by the aristocracy\nitself.\n\nIn the course of these seven hundred years it sometimes happened that in\norder to resist the authority of the Crown, or to diminish the power of\ntheir rivals, the nobles granted a certain share of political rights to\nthe people. Or, more frequently, the king permitted the lower orders\nto enjoy a degree of power, with the intention of repressing the\naristocracy. In France the kings have always been the most active and\nthe most constant of levellers. When they were strong and ambitious they\nspared no pains to raise the people to the level of the nobles; when\nthey were temperate or weak they allowed the people to rise above\nthemselves. Some assisted the democracy by their talents, others by\ntheir vices. Louis XI and Louis XIV reduced every rank beneath the\nthrone to the same subjection; Louis XV descended, himself and all his\nCourt, into the dust.\n\nAs soon as land was held on any other than a feudal tenure, and\npersonal property began in its turn to confer influence and power, every\nimprovement which was introduced in commerce or manufacture was a fresh\nelement of the equality of conditions. Henceforward every new discovery,\nevery new want which it engendered, and every new desire which craved\nsatisfaction, was a step towards the universal level. The taste for\nluxury, the love of war, the sway of fashion, and the most superficial\nas well as the deepest passions of the human heart, co-operated to\nenrich the poor and to impoverish the rich.\n\nFrom the time when the exercise of the intellect became the source of\nstrength and of wealth, it is impossible not to consider every addition\nto science, every fresh truth, and every new idea as a germ of power\nplaced within the reach of the people. Poetry, eloquence, and memory,\nthe grace of wit, the glow of imagination, the depth of thought, and all\nthe gifts which are bestowed by Providence with an equal hand, turned\nto the advantage of the democracy; and even when they were in the\npossession of its adversaries they still served its cause by throwing\ninto relief the natural greatness of man; its conquests spread,\ntherefore, with those of civilization and knowledge, and literature\nbecame an arsenal where the poorest and the weakest could always find\nweapons to their hand.\n\nIn perusing the pages of our history, we shall scarcely meet with a\nsingle great event, in the lapse of seven hundred years, which has not\nturned to the advantage of equality. The Crusades and the wars of the\nEnglish decimated the nobles and divided their possessions; the erection\nof communities introduced an element of democratic liberty into the\nbosom of feudal monarchy; the invention of fire-arms equalized the\nvillein and the noble on the field of battle; printing opened the same\nresources to the minds of all classes; the post was organized so as to\nbring the same information to the door of the poor man's cottage and to\nthe gate of the palace; and Protestantism proclaimed that all men are\nalike able to find the road to heaven. The discovery of America offered\na thousand new paths to fortune, and placed riches and power within\nthe reach of the adventurous and the obscure. If we examine what has\nhappened in France at intervals of fifty years, beginning with the\neleventh century, we shall invariably perceive that a twofold revolution\nhas taken place in the state of society. The noble has gone down on the\nsocial ladder, and the roturier has gone up; the one descends as the\nother rises. Every half century brings them nearer to each other, and\nthey will very shortly meet.\n\nNor is this phenomenon at all peculiar to France. Whithersoever we turn\nour eyes we shall witness the same continual revolution throughout the\nwhole of Christendom. The various occurrences of national existence have\neverywhere turned to the advantage of democracy; all men have aided it\nby their exertions: those who have intentionally labored in its cause,\nand those who have served it unwittingly; those who have fought for\nit and those who have declared themselves its opponents, have all\nbeen driven along in the same track, have all labored to one end, some\nignorantly and some unwillingly; all have been blind instruments in the\nhands of God.\n\nThe gradual development of the equality of conditions is therefore a\nprovidential fact, and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine\ndecree: it is universal, it is durable, it constantly eludes all human\ninterference, and all events as well as all men contribute to its\nprogress. Would it, then, be wise to imagine that a social impulse which\ndates from so far back can be checked by the efforts of a generation? Is\nit credible that the democracy which has annihilated the feudal system\nand vanquished kings will respect the citizen and the capitalist? Will\nit stop now that it has grown so strong and its adversaries so weak?\nNone can say which way we are going, for all terms of comparison are\nwanting: the equality of conditions is more complete in the Christian\ncountries of the present day than it has been at any time or in any part\nof the world; so that the extent of what already exists prevents us from\nforeseeing what may be yet to come.\n\nThe whole book which is here offered to the public has been written\nunder the impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the\nauthor's mind by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution,\nwhich has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles, and\nwhich is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made. It is\nnot necessary that God himself should speak in order to disclose to\nus the unquestionable signs of His will; we can discern them in the\nhabitual course of nature, and in the invariable tendency of events: I\nknow, without a special revelation, that the planets move in the orbits\ntraced by the Creator's finger. If the men of our time were led by\nattentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the\ngradual and progressive development of social equality is at once the\npast and future of their history, this solitary truth would confer the\nsacred character of a Divine decree upon the change. To attempt to\ncheck democracy would be in that case to resist the will of God; and\nthe nations would then be constrained to make the best of the social lot\nawarded to them by Providence.\n\nThe Christian nations of our age seem to me to present a most alarming\nspectacle; the impulse which is bearing them along is so strong that it\ncannot be stopped, but it is not yet so rapid that it cannot be guided:\ntheir fate is in their hands; yet a little while and it may be so no\nlonger. The first duty which is at this time imposed upon those who\ndirect our affairs is to educate the democracy; to warm its faith,\nif that be possible; to purify its morals; to direct its energies;\nto substitute a knowledge of business for its inexperience, and an\nacquaintance with its true interests for its blind propensities; to\nadapt its government to time and place, and to modify it in compliance\nwith the occurrences and the actors of the age. A new science of\npolitics is indispensable to a new world. This, however, is what we\nthink of least; launched in the middle of a rapid stream, we obstinately\nfix our eyes on the ruins which may still be described upon the shore we\nhave left, whilst the current sweeps us along, and drives us backwards\ntowards the gulf.\n\nIn no country in Europe has the great social revolution which I have\nbeen describing made such rapid progress as in France; but it has always\nbeen borne on by chance. The heads of the State have never had any\nforethought for its exigencies, and its victories have been obtained\nwithout their consent or without their knowledge. The most powerful, the\nmost intelligent, and the most moral classes of the nation have never\nattempted to connect themselves with it in order to guide it. The people\nhas consequently been abandoned to its wild propensities, and it has\ngrown up like those outcasts who receive their education in the\npublic streets, and who are unacquainted with aught but the vices and\nwretchedness of society. The existence of a democracy was seemingly\nunknown, when on a sudden it took possession of the supreme power.\nEverything was then submitted to its caprices; it was worshipped as the\nidol of strength; until, when it was enfeebled by its own excesses, the\nlegislator conceived the rash project of annihilating its power, instead\nof instructing it and correcting its vices; no attempt was made to fit\nit to govern, but all were bent on excluding it from the government.\n\nThe consequence of this has been that the democratic revolution has been\neffected only in the material parts of society, without that concomitant\nchange in laws, ideas, customs, and manners which was necessary to\nrender such a revolution beneficial. We have gotten a democracy, but\nwithout the conditions which lessen its vices and render its natural\nadvantages more prominent; and although we already perceive the evils it\nbrings, we are ignorant of the benefits it may confer.\n\nWhile the power of the Crown, supported by the aristocracy, peaceably\ngoverned the nations of Europe, society possessed, in the midst of its\nwretchedness, several different advantages which can now scarcely be\nappreciated or conceived. The power of a part of his subjects was an\ninsurmountable barrier to the tyranny of the prince; and the monarch,\nwho felt the almost divine character which he enjoyed in the eyes of\nthe multitude, derived a motive for the just use of his power from the\nrespect which he inspired. High as they were placed above the people,\nthe nobles could not but take that calm and benevolent interest in\nits fate which the shepherd feels towards his flock; and without\nacknowledging the poor as their equals, they watched over the destiny of\nthose whose welfare Providence had entrusted to their care. The people\nnever having conceived the idea of a social condition different from its\nown, and entertaining no expectation of ever ranking with its chiefs,\nreceived benefits from them without discussing their rights. It grew\nattached to them when they were clement and just, and it submitted\nwithout resistance or servility to their exactions, as to the inevitable\nvisitations of the arm of God. Custom, and the manners of the time,\nhad moreover created a species of law in the midst of violence, and\nestablished certain limits to oppression. As the noble never suspected\nthat anyone would attempt to deprive him of the privileges which\nhe believed to be legitimate, and as the serf looked upon his own\ninferiority as a consequence of the immutable order of nature, it is\neasy to imagine that a mutual exchange of good-will took place between\ntwo classes so differently gifted by fate. Inequality and wretchedness\nwere then to be found in society; but the souls of neither rank of men\nwere degraded. Men are not corrupted by the exercise of power or debased\nby the habit of obedience, but by the exercise of a power which they\nbelieve to be illegal and by obedience to a rule which they consider\nto be usurped and oppressive. On one side was wealth, strength, and\nleisure, accompanied by the refinements of luxury, the elegance of\ntaste, the pleasures of wit, and the religion of art. On the other was\nlabor and a rude ignorance; but in the midst of this coarse and ignorant\nmultitude it was not uncommon to meet with energetic passions, generous\nsentiments, profound religious convictions, and independent virtues. The\nbody of a State thus organized might boast of its stability, its power,\nand, above all, of its glory.\n\nBut the scene is now changed, and gradually the two ranks mingle; the\ndivisions which once severed mankind are lowered, property is divided,\npower is held in common, the light of intelligence spreads, and the\ncapacities of all classes are equally cultivated; the State becomes\ndemocratic, and the empire of democracy is slowly and peaceably\nintroduced into the institutions and the manners of the nation. I can\nconceive a society in which all men would profess an equal attachment\nand respect for the laws of which they are the common authors; in which\nthe authority of the State would be respected as necessary, though not\nas divine; and the loyalty of the subject to its chief magistrate would\nnot be a passion, but a quiet and rational persuasion. Every individual\nbeing in the possession of rights which he is sure to retain, a kind of\nmanly reliance and reciprocal courtesy would arise between all classes,\nalike removed from pride and meanness. The people, well acquainted\nwith its true interests, would allow that in order to profit by the\nadvantages of society it is necessary to satisfy its demands. In this\nstate of things the voluntary association of the citizens might supply\nthe individual exertions of the nobles, and the community would be alike\nprotected from anarchy and from oppression.\n\nI admit that, in a democratic State thus constituted, society will not\nbe stationary; but the impulses of the social body may be regulated and\ndirected forwards; if there be less splendor than in the halls of an\naristocracy, the contrast of misery will be less frequent also; the\npleasures of enjoyment may be less excessive, but those of comfort will\nbe more general; the sciences may be less perfectly cultivated, but\nignorance will be less common; the impetuosity of the feelings will be\nrepressed, and the habits of the nation softened; there will be more\nvices and fewer crimes. In the absence of enthusiasm and of an\nardent faith, great sacrifices may be obtained from the members of a\ncommonwealth by an appeal to their understandings and their experience;\neach individual will feel the same necessity for uniting with his\nfellow-citizens to protect his own weakness; and as he knows that if\nthey are to assist he must co-operate, he will readily perceive that his\npersonal interest is identified with the interest of the community. The\nnation, taken as a whole, will be less brilliant, less glorious, and\nperhaps less strong; but the majority of the citizens will enjoy a\ngreater degree of prosperity, and the people will remain quiet, not\nbecause it despairs of amelioration, but because it is conscious of the\nadvantages of its condition. If all the consequences of this state of\nthings were not good or useful, society would at least have appropriated\nall such as were useful and good; and having once and for ever\nrenounced the social advantages of aristocracy, mankind would enter into\npossession of all the benefits which democracy can afford.\n\nBut here it may be asked what we have adopted in the place of those\ninstitutions, those ideas, and those customs of our forefathers which\nwe have abandoned. The spell of royalty is broken, but it has not been\nsucceeded by the majesty of the laws; the people has learned to despise\nall authority, but fear now extorts a larger tribute of obedience than\nthat which was formerly paid by reverence and by love.\n\nI perceive that we have destroyed those independent beings which were\nable to cope with tyranny single-handed; but it is the Government\nthat has inherited the privileges of which families, corporations, and\nindividuals have been deprived; the weakness of the whole community has\ntherefore succeeded that influence of a small body of citizens, which,\nif it was sometimes oppressive, was often conservative. The division\nof property has lessened the distance which separated the rich from the\npoor; but it would seem that the nearer they draw to each other, the\ngreater is their mutual hatred, and the more vehement the envy and the\ndread with which they resist each other's claims to power; the notion of\nRight is alike insensible to both classes, and Force affords to both the\nonly argument for the present, and the only guarantee for the future.\nThe poor man retains the prejudices of his forefathers without their\nfaith, and their ignorance without their virtues; he has adopted\nthe doctrine of self-interest as the rule of his actions, without\nunderstanding the science which controls it, and his egotism is no less\nblind than his devotedness was formerly. If society is tranquil, it is\nnot because it relies upon its strength and its well-being, but because\nit knows its weakness and its infirmities; a single effort may cost it\nits life; everybody feels the evil, but no one has courage or energy\nenough to seek the cure; the desires, the regret, the sorrows, and the\njoys of the time produce nothing that is visible or permanent, like the\npassions of old men which terminate in impotence.\n\nWe have, then, abandoned whatever advantages the old state of things\nafforded, without receiving any compensation from our present condition;\nwe have destroyed an aristocracy, and we seem inclined to survey its\nruins with complacency, and to fix our abode in the midst of them.\n\nThe phenomena which the intellectual world presents are not less\ndeplorable. The democracy of France, checked in its course or abandoned\nto its lawless passions, has overthrown whatever crossed its path, and\nhas shaken all that it has not destroyed. Its empire on society has\nnot been gradually introduced or peaceably established, but it has\nconstantly advanced in the midst of disorder and the agitation of a\nconflict. In the heat of the struggle each partisan is hurried beyond\nthe limits of his opinions by the opinions and the excesses of his\nopponents, until he loses sight of the end of his exertions, and holds a\nlanguage which disguises his real sentiments or secret instincts. Hence\narises the strange confusion which we are witnessing. I cannot recall to\nmy mind a passage in history more worthy of sorrow and of pity than the\nscenes which are happening under our eyes; it is as if the natural bond\nwhich unites the opinions of man to his tastes and his actions to\nhis principles was now broken; the sympathy which has always been\nacknowledged between the feelings and the ideas of mankind appears to\nbe dissolved, and all the laws of moral analogy to be abolished.\n\nZealous Christians may be found amongst us whose minds are nurtured in\nthe love and knowledge of a future life, and who readily espouse\nthe cause of human liberty as the source of all moral greatness.\nChristianity, which has declared that all men are equal in the sight of\nGod, will not refuse to acknowledge that all citizens are equal in the\neye of the law. But, by a singular concourse of events, religion is\nentangled in those institutions which democracy assails, and it is not\nunfrequently brought to reject the equality it loves, and to curse that\ncause of liberty as a foe which it might hallow by its alliance.\n\nBy the side of these religious men I discern others whose looks are\nturned to the earth more than to Heaven; they are the partisans of\nliberty, not only as the source of the noblest virtues, but more\nespecially as the root of all solid advantages; and they sincerely\ndesire to extend its sway, and to impart its blessings to mankind. It\nis natural that they should hasten to invoke the assistance of religion,\nfor they must know that liberty cannot be established without morality,\nnor morality without faith; but they have seen religion in the ranks of\ntheir adversaries, and they inquire no further; some of them attack it\nopenly, and the remainder are afraid to defend it.\n\nIn former ages slavery has been advocated by the venal and\nslavish-minded, whilst the independent and the warm-hearted were\nstruggling without hope to save the liberties of mankind. But men of\nhigh and generous characters are now to be met with, whose opinions are\nat variance with their inclinations, and who praise that servility which\nthey have themselves never known. Others, on the contrary, speak in\nthe name of liberty, as if they were able to feel its sanctity and its\nmajesty, and loudly claim for humanity those rights which they have\nalways disowned. There are virtuous and peaceful individuals whose\npure morality, quiet habits, affluence, and talents fit them to be the\nleaders of the surrounding population; their love of their country is\nsincere, and they are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to its\nwelfare, but they confound the abuses of civilization with its benefits,\nand the idea of evil is inseparable in their minds from that of novelty.\n\nNot far from this class is another party, whose object is to materialize\nmankind, to hit upon what is expedient without heeding what is just,\nto acquire knowledge without faith, and prosperity apart from virtue;\nassuming the title of the champions of modern civilization, and placing\nthemselves in a station which they usurp with insolence, and from\nwhich they are driven by their own unworthiness. Where are we then?\nThe religionists are the enemies of liberty, and the friends of liberty\nattack religion; the high-minded and the noble advocate subjection,\nand the meanest and most servile minds preach independence; honest and\nenlightened citizens are opposed to all progress, whilst men without\npatriotism and without principles are the apostles of civilization and\nof intelligence. Has such been the fate of the centuries which have\npreceded our own? and has man always inhabited a world like the present,\nwhere nothing is linked together, where virtue is without genius, and\ngenius without honor; where the love of order is confounded with a taste\nfor oppression, and the holy rites of freedom with a contempt of law;\nwhere the light thrown by conscience on human actions is dim, and\nwhere nothing seems to be any longer forbidden or allowed, honorable\nor shameful, false or true? I cannot, however, believe that the Creator\nmade man to leave him in an endless struggle with the intellectual\nmiseries which surround us: God destines a calmer and a more certain\nfuture to the communities of Europe; I am unacquainted with His designs,\nbut I shall not cease to believe in them because I cannot fathom them,\nand I had rather mistrust my own capacity than His justice.\n\nThere is a country in the world where the great revolution which I am\nspeaking of seems nearly to have reached its natural limits; it has\nbeen effected with ease and simplicity, say rather that this country\nhas attained the consequences of the democratic revolution which we\nare undergoing without having experienced the revolution itself. The\nemigrants who fixed themselves on the shores of America in the beginning\nof the seventeenth century severed the democratic principle from all\nthe principles which repressed it in the old communities of Europe, and\ntransplanted it unalloyed to the New World. It has there been allowed to\nspread in perfect freedom, and to put forth its consequences in the laws\nby influencing the manners of the country.\n\nIt appears to me beyond a doubt that sooner or later we shall arrive,\nlike the Americans, at an almost complete equality of conditions. But I\ndo not conclude from this that we shall ever be necessarily led to draw\nthe same political consequences which the Americans have derived from\na similar social organization. I am far from supposing that they have\nchosen the only form of government which a democracy may adopt; but the\nidentity of the efficient cause of laws and manners in the two countries\nis sufficient to account for the immense interest we have in becoming\nacquainted with its effects in each of them.\n\nIt is not, then, merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that I have\nexamined America; my wish has been to find instruction by which we may\nourselves profit. Whoever should imagine that I have intended to write a\npanegyric will perceive that such was not my design; nor has it been\nmy object to advocate any form of government in particular, for I am\nof opinion that absolute excellence is rarely to be found in any\nlegislation; I have not even affected to discuss whether the social\nrevolution, which I believe to be irresistible, is advantageous or\nprejudicial to mankind; I have acknowledged this revolution as a fact\nalready accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment; and I have\nselected the nation, from amongst those which have undergone it, in\nwhich its development has been the most peaceful and the most complete,\nin order to discern its natural consequences, and, if it be possible, to\ndistinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable. I confess\nthat in America I saw more than America; I sought the image of democracy\nitself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its\npassions, in order to learn what we have to fear or to hope from its\nprogress.\n\nIn the first part of this work I have attempted to show the tendency\ngiven to the laws by the democracy of America, which is abandoned almost\nwithout restraint to its instinctive propensities, and to exhibit the\ncourse it prescribes to the Government and the influence it exercises on\naffairs. I have sought to discover the evils and the advantages which\nit produces. I have examined the precautions used by the Americans to\ndirect it, as well as those which they have not adopted, and I have\nundertaken to point out the causes which enable it to govern society.\nI do not know whether I have succeeded in making known what I saw in\nAmerica, but I am certain that such has been my sincere desire, and that\nI have never, knowingly, moulded facts to ideas, instead of ideas to\nfacts.\n\nWhenever a point could be established by the aid of written documents,\nI have had recourse to the original text, and to the most authentic and\napproved works. I have cited my authorities in the notes, and anyone may\nrefer to them. Whenever an opinion, a political custom, or a remark on\nthe manners of the country was concerned, I endeavored to consult the\nmost enlightened men I met with. If the point in question was important\nor doubtful, I was not satisfied with one testimony, but I formed my\nopinion on the evidence of several witnesses. Here the reader must\nnecessarily believe me upon my word. I could frequently have quoted names\nwhich are either known to him, or which deserve to be so, in proof of\nwhat I advance; but I have carefully abstained from this practice. A\nstranger frequently hears important truths at the fire-side of his host,\nwhich the latter would perhaps conceal from the ear of friendship;\nhe consoles himself with his guest for the silence to which he is\nrestricted, and the shortness of the traveller's stay takes away all\nfear of his indiscretion. I carefully noted every conversation of this\nnature as soon as it occurred, but these notes will never leave my\nwriting-case; I had rather injure the success of my statements than\nadd my name to the list of those strangers who repay the generous\nhospitality they have received by subsequent chagrin and annoyance.\n\nI am aware that, notwithstanding my care, nothing will be easier than\nto criticise this book, if anyone ever chooses to criticise it. Those\nreaders who may examine it closely will discover the fundamental idea\nwhich connects the several parts together. But the diversity of the\nsubjects I have had to treat is exceedingly great, and it will not be\ndifficult to oppose an isolated fact to the body of facts which I quote,\nor an isolated idea to the body of ideas I put forth. I hope to be read\nin the spirit which has guided my labors, and that my book may be judged\nby the general impression it leaves, as I have formed my own judgment\nnot on any single reason, but upon the mass of evidence. It must not be\nforgotten that the author who wishes to be understood is obliged to push\nall his ideas to their utmost theoretical consequences, and often to\nthe verge of what is false or impracticable; for if it be necessary\nsometimes to quit the rules of logic in active life, such is not the\ncase in discourse, and a man finds that almost as many difficulties\nspring from inconsistency of language as usually arise from\ninconsistency of conduct.\n\nI conclude by pointing out myself what many readers will consider\nthe principal defect of the work. This book is written to favor no\nparticular views, and in composing it I have entertained no designs\nof serving or attacking any party; I have undertaken not to see\ndifferently, but to look further than parties, and whilst they are\nbusied for the morrow I have turned my thoughts to the Future.\n\n\n\n\nChapter I: Exterior Form Of North America\n\nChapter Summary\n\nNorth America divided into two vast regions, one inclining towards the\nPole, the other towards the Equator--Valley of the Mississippi--Traces\nof the Revolutions of the Globe--Shore of the Atlantic Ocean where the\nEnglish Colonies were founded--Difference in the appearance of North\nand of South America at the time of their Discovery--Forests of\nNorth America--Prairies--Wandering Tribes of Natives--Their outward\nappearance, manners, and language--Traces of an unknown people.\n\nExterior Form Of North America\n\n\nNorth America presents in its external form certain general features\nwhich it is easy to discriminate at the first glance. A sort of\nmethodical order seems to have regulated the separation of land and\nwater, mountains and valleys. A simple, but grand, arrangement is\ndiscoverable amidst the confusion of objects and the prodigious variety\nof scenes. This continent is divided, almost equally, into two vast\nregions, one of which is bounded on the north by the Arctic Pole, and\nby the two great oceans on the east and west. It stretches towards the\nsouth, forming a triangle whose irregular sides meet at length below\nthe great lakes of Canada. The second region begins where the other\nterminates, and includes all the remainder of the continent. The one\nslopes gently towards the Pole, the other towards the Equator.\n\nThe territory comprehended in the first region descends towards the\nnorth with so imperceptible a slope that it may almost be said to form\na level plain. Within the bounds of this immense tract of country there\nare neither high mountains nor deep valleys. Streams meander through it\nirregularly: great rivers mix their currents, separate and meet again,\ndisperse and form vast marshes, losing all trace of their channels\nin the labyrinth of waters they have themselves created; and thus, at\nlength, after innumerable windings, fall into the Polar Seas. The great\nlakes which bound this first region are not walled in, like most of\nthose in the Old World, between hills and rocks. Their banks are flat,\nand rise but a few feet above the level of their waters; each of them\nthus forming a vast bowl filled to the brim. The slightest change in the\nstructure of the globe would cause their waters to rush either towards\nthe Pole or to the tropical sea.\n\nThe second region is more varied on its surface, and better suited for\nthe habitation of man. Two long chains of mountains divide it from one\nextreme to the other; the Alleghany ridge takes the form of the shores\nof the Atlantic Ocean; the other is parallel with the Pacific. The space\nwhich lies between these two chains of mountains contains 1,341,649\nsquare miles. *a Its surface is therefore about six times as great as\nthat of France. This vast territory, however, forms a single valley,\none side of which descends gradually from the rounded summits of the\nAlleghanies, while the other rises in an uninterrupted course towards\nthe tops of the Rocky Mountains. At the bottom of the valley flows an\nimmense river, into which the various streams issuing from the mountains\nfall from all parts. In memory of their native land, the French formerly\ncalled this river the St. Louis. The Indians, in their pompous language,\nhave named it the Father of Waters, or the Mississippi.\n\n[Footnote a: Darby's \"View of the United States.\"]\n\nThe Mississippi takes its source above the limit of the two great\nregions of which I have spoken, not far from the highest point of the\ntable-land where they unite. Near the same spot rises another river, *b\nwhich empties itself into the Polar seas. The course of the Mississippi\nis at first dubious: it winds several times towards the north, from\nwhence it rose; and at length, after having been delayed in lakes and\nmarshes, it flows slowly onwards to the south. Sometimes quietly gliding\nalong the argillaceous bed which nature has assigned to it, sometimes\nswollen by storms, the Mississippi waters 2,500 miles in its course.\n*c At the distance of 1,364 miles from its mouth this river attains an\naverage depth of fifteen feet; and it is navigated by vessels of\n300 tons burden for a course of nearly 500 miles. Fifty-seven large\nnavigable rivers contribute to swell the waters of the Mississippi;\namongst others, the Missouri, which traverses a space of 2,500 miles;\nthe Arkansas of 1,300 miles, the Red River 1,000 miles, four whose\ncourse is from 800 to 1,000 miles in length, viz., the Illinois, the\nSt. Peter's, the St. Francis, and the Moingona; besides a countless\nmultitude of rivulets which unite from all parts their tributary\nstreams.\n\n[Footnote b: The Red River.]\n\n[Footnote c: Warden's \"Description of the United States.\"]\n\nThe valley which is watered by the Mississippi seems formed to be the\nbed of this mighty river, which, like a god of antiquity, dispenses both\ngood and evil in its course. On the shores of the stream nature displays\nan inexhaustible fertility; in proportion as you recede from its banks,\nthe powers of vegetation languish, the soil becomes poor, and the plants\nthat survive have a sickly growth. Nowhere have the great convulsions\nof the globe left more evident traces than in the valley of the\nMississippi; the whole aspect of the country shows the powerful effects\nof water, both by its fertility and by its barrenness. The waters of\nthe primeval ocean accumulated enormous beds of vegetable mould in the\nvalley, which they levelled as they retired. Upon the right shore of the\nriver are seen immense plains, as smooth as if the husbandman had\npassed over them with his roller. As you approach the mountains the soil\nbecomes more and more unequal and sterile; the ground is, as it were,\npierced in a thousand places by primitive rocks, which appear like the\nbones of a skeleton whose flesh is partly consumed. The surface of the\nearth is covered with a granite sand and huge irregular masses of stone,\namong which a few plants force their growth, and give the appearance of\na green field covered with the ruins of a vast edifice. These stones and\nthis sand discover, on examination, a perfect analogy with those which\ncompose the arid and broken summits of the Rocky Mountains. The flood\nof waters which washed the soil to the bottom of the valley afterwards\ncarried away portions of the rocks themselves; and these, dashed and\nbruised against the neighboring cliffs, were left scattered like wrecks\nat their feet. *d The valley of the Mississippi is, upon the whole, the\nmost magnificent dwelling-place prepared by God for man's abode; and yet\nit may be said that at present it is but a mighty desert.\n\n[Footnote d: See Appendix, A.]\n\n\nOn the eastern side of the Alleghanies, between the base of these\nmountains and the Atlantic Ocean, there lies a long ridge of rocks and\nsand, which the sea appears to have left behind as it retired. The mean\nbreadth of this territory does not exceed one hundred miles; but it is\nabout nine hundred miles in length. This part of the American continent\nhas a soil which offers every obstacle to the husbandman, and its\nvegetation is scanty and unvaried.\n\nUpon this inhospitable coast the first united efforts of human industry\nwere made. The tongue of arid land was the cradle of those English\ncolonies which were destined one day to become the United States of\nAmerica. The centre of power still remains here; whilst in the backwoods\nthe true elements of the great people to whom the future control of the\ncontinent belongs are gathering almost in secrecy together.\n\nWhen the Europeans first landed on the shores of the West Indies,\nand afterwards on the coast of South America, they thought themselves\ntransported into those fabulous regions of which poets had sung. The sea\nsparkled with phosphoric light, and the extraordinary transparency of\nits waters discovered to the view of the navigator all that had hitherto\nbeen hidden in the deep abyss. *e Here and there appeared little islands\nperfumed with odoriferous plants, and resembling baskets of flowers\nfloating on the tranquil surface of the ocean. Every object which met\nthe sight, in this enchanting region, seemed prepared to satisfy the\nwants or contribute to the pleasures of man. Almost all the trees were\nloaded with nourishing fruits, and those which were useless as food\ndelighted the eye by the brilliancy and variety of their colors. In\ngroves of fragrant lemon-trees, wild figs, flowering myrtles, acacias,\nand oleanders, which were hung with festoons of various climbing plants,\ncovered with flowers, a multitude of birds unknown in Europe displayed\ntheir bright plumage, glittering with purple and azure, and mingled\ntheir warbling with the harmony of a world teeming with life and motion.\n*f Underneath this brilliant exterior death was concealed. But the air\nof these climates had so enervating an influence that man, absorbed by\npresent enjoyment, was rendered regardless of the future.\n\n[Footnote e: Malte Brun tells us (vol. v. p. 726) that the water of the\nCaribbean Sea is so transparent that corals and fish are discernible at\na depth of sixty fathoms. The ship seemed to float in air, the navigator\nbecame giddy as his eye penetrated through the crystal flood, and beheld\nsubmarine gardens, or beds of shells, or gilded fishes gliding among\ntufts and thickets of seaweed.]\n\n[Footnote f: See Appendix, B.]\n\nNorth America appeared under a very different aspect; there everything\nwas grave, serious, and solemn: it seemed created to be the domain of\nintelligence, as the South was that of sensual delight. A turbulent and\nfoggy ocean washed its shores. It was girt round by a belt of granite\nrocks, or by wide tracts of sand. The foliage of its woods was dark and\ngloomy, for they were composed of firs, larches, evergreen oaks, wild\nolive-trees, and laurels. Beyond this outer belt lay the thick shades\nof the central forest, where the largest trees which are produced in\nthe two hemispheres grow side by side. The plane, the catalpa, the\nsugar-maple, and the Virginian poplar mingled their branches with those\nof the oak, the beech, and the lime. In these, as in the forests of the\nOld World, destruction was perpetually going on. The ruins of vegetation\nwere heaped upon each other; but there was no laboring hand to remove\nthem, and their decay was not rapid enough to make room for the\ncontinual work of reproduction. Climbing plants, grasses, and other\nherbs forced their way through the mass of dying trees; they crept along\ntheir bending trunks, found nourishment in their dusty cavities, and\na passage beneath the lifeless bark. Thus decay gave its assistance to\nlife, and their respective productions were mingled together. The depths\nof these forests were gloomy and obscure, and a thousand rivulets,\nundirected in their course by human industry, preserved in them a\nconstant moisture. It was rare to meet with flowers, wild fruits, or\nbirds beneath their shades. The fall of a tree overthrown by age,\nthe rushing torrent of a cataract, the lowing of the buffalo, and the\nhowling of the wind were the only sounds which broke the silence of\nnature.\n\nTo the east of the great river, the woods almost disappeared; in their\nstead were seen prairies of immense extent. Whether Nature in her\ninfinite variety had denied the germs of trees to these fertile plains,\nor whether they had once been covered with forests, subsequently\ndestroyed by the hand of man, is a question which neither tradition nor\nscientific research has been able to resolve.\n\nThese immense deserts were not, however, devoid of human inhabitants.\nSome wandering tribes had been for ages scattered among the forest\nshades or the green pastures of the prairie. From the mouth of the St.\nLawrence to the delta of the Mississippi, and from the Atlantic to the\nPacific Ocean, these savages possessed certain points of resemblance\nwhich bore witness of their common origin; but at the same time they\ndiffered from all other known races of men: *g they were neither white\nlike the Europeans, nor yellow like most of the Asiatics, nor black like\nthe negroes. Their skin was reddish brown, their hair long and shining,\ntheir lips thin, and their cheekbones very prominent. The languages\nspoken by the North American tribes are various as far as regarded their\nwords, but they were subject to the same grammatical rules. These rules\ndiffered in several points from such as had been observed to govern the\norigin of language. The idiom of the Americans seemed to be the product\nof new combinations, and bespoke an effort of the understanding of which\nthe Indians of our days would be incapable. *h\n\n[Footnote g: With the progress of discovery some resemblance has been\nfound to exist between the physical conformation, the language, and\nthe habits of the Indians of North America, and those of the Tongous,\nMantchous, Mongols, Tartars, and other wandering tribes of Asia. The\nland occupied by these tribes is not very distant from Behring's Strait,\nwhich allows of the supposition, that at a remote period they gave\ninhabitants to the desert continent of America. But this is a point\nwhich has not yet been clearly elucidated by science. See Malte Brun,\nvol. v.; the works of Humboldt; Fischer, \"Conjecture sur l'Origine des\nAmericains\"; Adair, \"History of the American Indians.\"]\n\n[Footnote h: See Appendix, C.]\n\nThe social state of these tribes differed also in many respects from all\nthat was seen in the Old World. They seemed to have multiplied freely\nin the midst of their deserts without coming in contact with other races\nmore civilized than their own. Accordingly, they exhibited none of those\nindistinct, incoherent notions of right and wrong, none of that deep\ncorruption of manners, which is usually joined with ignorance and\nrudeness among nations which, after advancing to civilization, have\nrelapsed into a state of barbarism. The Indian was indebted to no one\nbut himself; his virtues, his vices, and his prejudices were his own\nwork; he had grown up in the wild independence of his nature.\n\nIf, in polished countries, the lowest of the people are rude and\nuncivil, it is not merely because they are poor and ignorant, but that,\nbeing so, they are in daily contact with rich and enlightened men.\nThe sight of their own hard lot and of their weakness, which is\ndaily contrasted with the happiness and power of some of their\nfellow-creatures, excites in their hearts at the same time the\nsentiments of anger and of fear: the consciousness of their inferiority\nand of their dependence irritates while it humiliates them. This state\nof mind displays itself in their manners and language; they are at once\ninsolent and servile. The truth of this is easily proved by observation;\nthe people are more rude in aristocratic countries than elsewhere, in\nopulent cities than in rural districts. In those places where the rich\nand powerful are assembled together the weak and the indigent feel\nthemselves oppressed by their inferior condition. Unable to perceive a\nsingle chance of regaining their equality, they give up to despair, and\nallow themselves to fall below the dignity of human nature.\n\nThis unfortunate effect of the disparity of conditions is not observable\nin savage life: the Indians, although they are ignorant and poor, are\nequal and free. At the period when Europeans first came among them\nthe natives of North America were ignorant of the value of riches, and\nindifferent to the enjoyments which civilized man procures to himself\nby their means. Nevertheless there was nothing coarse in their\ndemeanor; they practised an habitual reserve and a kind of aristocratic\npoliteness. Mild and hospitable when at peace, though merciless in\nwar beyond any known degree of human ferocity, the Indian would expose\nhimself to die of hunger in order to succor the stranger who asked\nadmittance by night at the door of his hut; yet he could tear in pieces\nwith his hands the still quivering limbs of his prisoner. The famous\nrepublics of antiquity never gave examples of more unshaken courage,\nmore haughty spirits, or more intractable love of independence than were\nhidden in former times among the wild forests of the New World. *i The\nEuropeans produced no great impression when they landed upon the shores\nof North America; their presence engendered neither envy nor fear. What\ninfluence could they possess over such men as we have described? The\nIndian could live without wants, suffer without complaint, and pour out\nhis death-song at the stake. *j Like all the other members of the great\nhuman family, these savages believed in the existence of a better world,\nand adored under different names, God, the creator of the universe.\nTheir notions on the great intellectual truths were in general simple\nand philosophical. *k\n\n[Footnote i: We learn from President Jefferson's \"Notes upon Virginia,\"\np. 148, that among the Iroquois, when attacked by a superior force, aged\nmen refused to fly or to survive the destruction of their country; and\nthey braved death like the ancient Romans when their capital was sacked\nby the Gauls. Further on, p. 150, he tells us that there is no example\nof an Indian who, having fallen into the hands of his enemies, begged\nfor his life; on the contrary, the captive sought to obtain death at the\nhands of his conquerors by the use of insult and provocation.]\n\n[Footnote j: See \"Histoire de la Louisiane,\" by Lepage Dupratz;\nCharlevoix, \"Histoire de la Nouvelle France\"; \"Lettres du Rev. G.\nHecwelder;\" \"Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,\" v. I;\nJefferson's \"Notes on Virginia,\" pp. 135-190. What is said by Jefferson\nis of especial weight, on account of the personal merit of the writer,\nof his peculiar position, and of the matter-of-fact age in which he\nlived.]\n\n[Footnote k: See Appendix, D.]\n\nAlthough we have here traced the character of a primitive people, yet it\ncannot be doubted that another people, more civilized and more advanced\nin all respects, had preceded it in the same regions.\n\nAn obscure tradition which prevailed among the Indians to the north of\nthe Atlantic informs us that these very tribes formerly dwelt on\nthe west side of the Mississippi. Along the banks of the Ohio, and\nthroughout the central valley, there are frequently found, at this day,\ntumuli raised by the hands of men. On exploring these heaps of earth to\ntheir centre, it is usual to meet with human bones, strange instruments,\narms and utensils of all kinds, made of metal, or destined for purposes\nunknown to the present race. The Indians of our time are unable to give\nany information relative to the history of this unknown people. Neither\ndid those who lived three hundred years ago, when America was first\ndiscovered, leave any accounts from which even an hypothesis could be\nformed. Tradition--that perishable, yet ever renewed monument of the\npristine world--throws no light upon the subject. It is an undoubted\nfact, however, that in this part of the globe thousands of our\nfellow-beings had lived. When they came hither, what was their origin,\ntheir destiny, their history, and how they perished, no one can tell.\nHow strange does it appear that nations have existed, and afterwards so\ncompletely disappeared from the earth that the remembrance of their very\nnames is effaced; their languages are lost; their glory is vanished like\na sound without an echo; though perhaps there is not one which has not\nleft behind it some tomb in memory of its passage! The most durable\nmonument of human labor is that which recalls the wretchedness and\nnothingness of man.\n\nAlthough the vast country which we have been describing was inhabited\nby many indigenous tribes, it may justly be said at the time of its\ndiscovery by Europeans to have formed one great desert. The Indians\noccupied without possessing it. It is by agricultural labor that man\nappropriates the soil, and the early inhabitants of North America\nlived by the produce of the chase. Their implacable prejudices, their\nuncontrolled passions, their vices, and still more perhaps their savage\nvirtues, consigned them to inevitable destruction. The ruin of these\nnations began from the day when Europeans landed on their shores; it has\nproceeded ever since, and we are now witnessing the completion of it.\nThey seem to have been placed by Providence amidst the riches of the New\nWorld to enjoy them for a season, and then surrender them. Those coasts,\nso admirably adapted for commerce and industry; those wide and deep\nrivers; that inexhaustible valley of the Mississippi; the whole\ncontinent, in short, seemed prepared to be the abode of a great nation,\nyet unborn.\n\nIn that land the great experiment was to be made, by civilized man, of\nthe attempt to construct society upon a new basis; and it was there, for\nthe first time, that theories hitherto unknown, or deemed impracticable,\nwere to exhibit a spectacle for which the world had not been prepared by\nthe history of the past.\n\n\nChapter II: Origin Of The Anglo-Americans--Part I\n\nChapter Summary\n\nUtility of knowing the origin of nations in order to understand their\nsocial condition and their laws--America the only country in which the\nstarting-point of a great people has been clearly observable--In what\nrespects all who emigrated to British America were similar--In what they\ndiffered--Remark applicable to all Europeans who established themselves\non the shores of the New World--Colonization of Virginia--Colonization\nof New England--Original character of the first inhabitants of New\nEngland--Their arrival--Their first laws--Their social contract--Penal\ncode borrowed from the Hebrew legislation--Religious fervor--Republican\nspirit--Intimate union of the spirit of religion with the spirit of\nliberty.\n\nOrigin Of The Anglo-Americans, And Its Importance In Relation To Their\nFuture Condition.\n\nAfter the birth of a human being his early years are obscurely spent in\nthe toils or pleasures of childhood. As he grows up the world receives\nhim, when his manhood begins, and he enters into contact with his\nfellows. He is then studied for the first time, and it is imagined\nthat the germ of the vices and the virtues of his maturer years is then\nformed. This, if I am not mistaken, is a great error. We must begin\nhigher up; we must watch the infant in its mother's arms; we must see\nthe first images which the external world casts upon the dark mirror\nof his mind; the first occurrences which he witnesses; we must hear the\nfirst words which awaken the sleeping powers of thought, and stand by\nhis earliest efforts, if we would understand the prejudices, the habits,\nand the passions which will rule his life. The entire man is, so to\nspeak, to be seen in the cradle of the child.\n\nThe growth of nations presents something analogous to this: they all\nbear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied\ntheir birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their\nbeing. If we were able to go back to the elements of states, and to\nexamine the oldest monuments of their history, I doubt not that we\nshould discover the primal cause of the prejudices, the habits, the\nruling passions, and, in short, of all that constitutes what is called\nthe national character; we should then find the explanation of certain\ncustoms which now seem at variance with the prevailing manners; of such\nlaws as conflict with established principles; and of such incoherent\nopinions as are here and there to be met with in society, like those\nfragments of broken chains which we sometimes see hanging from the vault\nof an edifice, and supporting nothing. This might explain the destinies\nof certain nations, which seem borne on by an unknown force to ends of\nwhich they themselves are ignorant. But hitherto facts have been wanting\nto researches of this kind: the spirit of inquiry has only come upon\ncommunities in their latter days; and when they at length contemplated\ntheir origin, time had already obscured it, or ignorance and pride\nadorned it with truth-concealing fables.\n\nAmerica is the only country in which it has been possible to witness\nthe natural and tranquil growth of society, and where the influences\nexercised on the future condition of states by their origin is clearly\ndistinguishable. At the period when the peoples of Europe landed in the\nNew World their national characteristics were already completely formed;\neach of them had a physiognomy of its own; and as they had already\nattained that stage of civilization at which men are led to study\nthemselves, they have transmitted to us a faithful picture of their\nopinions, their manners, and their laws. The men of the sixteenth\ncentury are almost as well known to us as our contemporaries. America,\nconsequently, exhibits in the broad light of day the phenomena which the\nignorance or rudeness of earlier ages conceals from our researches.\nNear enough to the time when the states of America were founded, to be\naccurately acquainted with their elements, and sufficiently removed from\nthat period to judge of some of their results, the men of our own day\nseem destined to see further than their predecessors into the series of\nhuman events. Providence has given us a torch which our forefathers did\nnot possess, and has allowed us to discern fundamental causes in the\nhistory of the world which the obscurity of the past concealed from\nthem. If we carefully examine the social and political state of America,\nafter having studied its history, we shall remain perfectly convinced\nthat not an opinion, not a custom, not a law, I may even say not an\nevent, is upon record which the origin of that people will not explain.\nThe readers of this book will find the germ of all that is to follow in\nthe present chapter, and the key to almost the whole work.\n\nThe emigrants who came, at different periods to occupy the territory now\ncovered by the American Union differed from each other in many respects;\ntheir aim was not the same, and they governed themselves on different\nprinciples. These men had, however, certain features in common, and\nthey were all placed in an analogous situation. The tie of language is\nperhaps the strongest and the most durable that can unite mankind. All\nthe emigrants spoke the same tongue; they were all offsets from the same\npeople. Born in a country which had been agitated for centuries by the\nstruggles of faction, and in which all parties had been obliged in\ntheir turn to place themselves under the protection of the laws, their\npolitical education had been perfected in this rude school, and they\nwere more conversant with the notions of right and the principles of\ntrue freedom than the greater part of their European contemporaries. At\nthe period of their first emigrations the parish system, that fruitful\ngerm of free institutions, was deeply rooted in the habits of the\nEnglish; and with it the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people had\nbeen introduced into the bosom of the monarchy of the House of Tudor.\n\nThe religious quarrels which have agitated the Christian world were then\nrife. England had plunged into the new order of things with headlong\nvehemence. The character of its inhabitants, which had always been\nsedate and reflective, became argumentative and austere. General\ninformation had been increased by intellectual debate, and the mind\nhad received a deeper cultivation. Whilst religion was the topic of\ndiscussion, the morals of the people were reformed. All these national\nfeatures are more or less discoverable in the physiognomy of those\nadventurers who came to seek a new home on the opposite shores of the\nAtlantic.\n\nAnother remark, to which we shall hereafter have occasion to recur, is\napplicable not only to the English, but to the French, the Spaniards,\nand all the Europeans who successively established themselves in the New\nWorld. All these European colonies contained the elements, if not the\ndevelopment, of a complete democracy. Two causes led to this result. It\nmay safely be advanced, that on leaving the mother-country the emigrants\nhad in general no notion of superiority over one another. The happy and\nthe powerful do not go into exile, and there are no surer guarantees of\nequality among men than poverty and misfortune. It happened, however,\non several occasions, that persons of rank were driven to America\nby political and religious quarrels. Laws were made to establish a\ngradation of ranks; but it was soon found that the soil of America was\nopposed to a territorial aristocracy. To bring that refractory land into\ncultivation, the constant and interested exertions of the owner himself\nwere necessary; and when the ground was prepared, its produce was found\nto be insufficient to enrich a master and a farmer at the same time.\nThe land was then naturally broken up into small portions, which the\nproprietor cultivated for himself. Land is the basis of an aristocracy,\nwhich clings to the soil that supports it; for it is not by privileges\nalone, nor by birth, but by landed property handed down from generation\nto generation, that an aristocracy is constituted. A nation may present\nimmense fortunes and extreme wretchedness, but unless those fortunes are\nterritorial there is no aristocracy, but simply the class of the rich\nand that of the poor.\n\nAll the British colonies had then a great degree of similarity at the\nepoch of their settlement. All of them, from their first beginning,\nseemed destined to witness the growth, not of the aristocratic liberty\nof their mother-country, but of that freedom of the middle and lower\norders of which the history of the world had as yet furnished no\ncomplete example.\n\nIn this general uniformity several striking differences were however\ndiscernible, which it is necessary to point out. Two branches may be\ndistinguished in the Anglo-American family, which have hitherto grown\nup without entirely commingling; the one in the South, the other in the\nNorth.\n\nVirginia received the first English colony; the emigrants took\npossession of it in 1607. The idea that mines of gold and silver are\nthe sources of national wealth was at that time singularly prevalent in\nEurope; a fatal delusion, which has done more to impoverish the nations\nwhich adopted it, and has cost more lives in America, than the united\ninfluence of war and bad laws. The men sent to Virginia *a were seekers\nof gold, adventurers, without resources and without character, whose\nturbulent and restless spirit endangered the infant colony, *b and\nrendered its progress uncertain. The artisans and agriculturists arrived\nafterwards; and, although they were a more moral and orderly race of\nmen, they were in nowise above the level of the inferior classes in\nEngland. *c No lofty conceptions, no intellectual system, directed the\nfoundation of these new settlements. The colony was scarcely established\nwhen slavery was introduced, *d and this was the main circumstance which\nhas exercised so prodigious an influence on the character, the laws, and\nall the future prospects of the South. Slavery, as we shall afterwards\nshow, dishonors labor; it introduces idleness into society, and with\nidleness, ignorance and pride, luxury and distress. It enervates the\npowers of the mind, and benumbs the activity of man. The influence of\nslavery, united to the English character, explains the manners and the\nsocial condition of the Southern States.\n\n[Footnote a: The charter granted by the Crown of England in 1609\nstipulated, amongst other conditions, that the adventurers should pay\nto the Crown a fifth of the produce of all gold and silver mines. See\nMarshall's \"Life of Washington,\" vol. i. pp. 18-66.] [Footnote b: A\nlarge portion of the adventurers, says Stith (\"History of Virginia\"),\nwere unprincipled young men of family, whom their parents were glad to\nship off, discharged servants, fraudulent bankrupts, or debauchees; and\nothers of the same class, people more apt to pillage and destroy than\nto assist the settlement, were the seditious chiefs, who easily led this\nband into every kind of extravagance and excess. See for the history of\nVirginia the following works:--\n\n\"History of Virginia, from the First Settlements in the year 1624,\" by\nSmith.\n\n\"History of Virginia,\" by William Stith.\n\n\"History of Virginia, from the Earliest Period,\" by Beverley.]\n\n[Footnote c: It was not till some time later that a certain number of\nrich English capitalists came to fix themselves in the colony.]\n\n[Footnote d: Slavery was introduced about the year 1620 by a Dutch\nvessel which landed twenty negroes on the banks of the river James. See\nChalmer.]\n\nIn the North, the same English foundation was modified by the most\nopposite shades of character; and here I may be allowed to enter into\nsome details. The two or three main ideas which constitute the basis\nof the social theory of the United States were first combined in the\nNorthern English colonies, more generally denominated the States of\nNew England. *e The principles of New England spread at first to the\nneighboring states; they then passed successively to the more distant\nones; and at length they imbued the whole Confederation. They now extend\ntheir influence beyond its limits over the whole American world. The\ncivilization of New England has been like a beacon lit upon a hill,\nwhich, after it has diffused its warmth around, tinges the distant\nhorizon with its glow.\n\n[Footnote e: The States of New England are those situated to the east of\nthe Hudson; they are now six in number: 1, Connecticut; 2, Rhode Island;\n3, Massachusetts; 4, Vermont; 5, New Hampshire; 6, Maine.]\n\nThe foundation of New England was a novel spectacle, and all the\ncircumstances attending it were singular and original. The large\nmajority of colonies have been first inhabited either by men without\neducation and without resources, driven by their poverty and their\nmisconduct from the land which gave them birth, or by speculators\nand adventurers greedy of gain. Some settlements cannot even boast so\nhonorable an origin; St. Domingo was founded by buccaneers; and the\ncriminal courts of England originally supplied the population of\nAustralia.\n\nThe settlers who established themselves on the shores of New England all\nbelonged to the more independent classes of their native country. Their\nunion on the soil of America at once presented the singular phenomenon\nof a society containing neither lords nor common people, neither rich\nnor poor. These men possessed, in proportion to their number, a greater\nmass of intelligence than is to be found in any European nation of\nour own time. All, without a single exception, had received a good\neducation, and many of them were known in Europe for their talents and\ntheir acquirements. The other colonies had been founded by adventurers\nwithout family; the emigrants of New England brought with them the best\nelements of order and morality--they landed in the desert accompanied\nby their wives and children. But what most especially distinguished them\nwas the aim of their undertaking. They had not been obliged by necessity\nto leave their country; the social position they abandoned was one to\nbe regretted, and their means of subsistence were certain. Nor did\nthey cross the Atlantic to improve their situation or to increase their\nwealth; the call which summoned them from the comforts of their homes\nwas purely intellectual; and in facing the inevitable sufferings of\nexile their object was the triumph of an idea.\n\nThe emigrants, or, as they deservedly styled themselves, the Pilgrims,\nbelonged to that English sect the austerity of whose principles had\nacquired for them the name of Puritans. Puritanism was not merely a\nreligious doctrine, but it corresponded in many points with the most\nabsolute democratic and republican theories. It was this tendency which\nhad aroused its most dangerous adversaries. Persecuted by the Government\nof the mother-country, and disgusted by the habits of a society opposed\nto the rigor of their own principles, the Puritans went forth to seek\nsome rude and unfrequented part of the world, where they could live\naccording to their own opinions, and worship God in freedom.\n\nA few quotations will throw more light upon the spirit of these pious\nadventures than all we can say of them. Nathaniel Morton, *f the\nhistorian of the first years of the settlement, thus opens his subject:\n\n[Footnote f: \"New England's Memorial,\" p. 13; Boston, 1826. See also\n\"Hutchinson's History,\" vol. ii. p. 440.]\n\n\"Gentle Reader,--I have for some length of time looked upon it as a duty\nincumbent, especially on the immediate successors of those that have had\nso large experience of those many memorable and signal demonstrations\nof God's goodness, viz., the first beginners of this Plantation in New\nEngland, to commit to writing his gracious dispensations on that\nbehalf; having so many inducements thereunto, not onely otherwise but\nso plentifully in the Sacred Scriptures: that so, what we have seen,\nand what our fathers have told us (Psalm lxxviii. 3, 4), we may not hide\nfrom our children, showing to the generations to come the praises of the\nLord; that especially the seed of Abraham his servant, and the children\nof Jacob his chosen (Psalm cv. 5, 6), may remember his marvellous\nworks in the beginning and progress of the planting of New England, his\nwonders and the judgments of his mouth; how that God brought a vine into\nthis wilderness; that he cast out the heathen, and planted it; that he\nmade room for it and caused it to take deep root; and it filled the land\n(Psalm lxxx. 8, 9). And not onely so, but also that he hath guided his\npeople by his strength to his holy habitation and planted them in the\nmountain of his inheritance in respect of precious Gospel enjoyments:\nand that as especially God may have the glory of all unto whom it\nis most due; so also some rays of glory may reach the names of those\nblessed Saints that were the main instruments and the beginning of this\nhappy enterprise.\"\n\nIt is impossible to read this opening paragraph without an involuntary\nfeeling of religious awe; it breathes the very savor of Gospel\nantiquity. The sincerity of the author heightens his power of language.\nThe band which to his eyes was a mere party of adventurers gone forth\nto seek their fortune beyond seas appears to the reader as the germ of a\ngreat nation wafted by Providence to a predestined shore.\n\nThe author thus continues his narrative of the departure of the first\npilgrims:--\n\n\"So they left that goodly and pleasant city of Leyden, *g which had been\ntheir resting-place for above eleven years; but they knew that they were\npilgrims and strangers here below, and looked not much on these things,\nbut lifted up their eyes to Heaven, their dearest country, where God\nhath prepared for them a city (Heb. xi. 16), and therein quieted their\nspirits. When they came to Delfs-Haven they found the ship and all\nthings ready; and such of their friends as could not come with them\nfollowed after them, and sundry came from Amsterdam to see them shipt,\nand to take their leaves of them. One night was spent with little sleep\nwith the most, but with friendly entertainment and Christian discourse,\nand other real expressions of true Christian love. The next day they\nwent on board, and their friends with them, where truly doleful was the\nsight of that sad and mournful parting, to hear what sighs and sobs and\nprayers did sound amongst them; what tears did gush from every eye,\nand pithy speeches pierced each other's heart, that sundry of the Dutch\nstrangers that stood on the Key as spectators could not refrain from\ntears. But the tide (which stays for no man) calling them away, that\nwere thus loth to depart, their Reverend Pastor falling down on his\nknees, and they all with him, with watery cheeks commended them with\nmost fervent prayers unto the Lord and his blessing; and then, with\nmutual embraces and many tears they took their leaves one of another,\nwhich proved to be the last leave to many of them.\"\n\n[Footnote g: The emigrants were, for the most part, godly Christians\nfrom the North of England, who had quitted their native country because\nthey were \"studious of reformation, and entered into covenant to walk\nwith one another according to the primitive pattern of the Word of God.\"\nThey emigrated to Holland, and settled in the city of Leyden in 1610,\nwhere they abode, being lovingly respected by the Dutch, for many years:\nthey left it in 1620 for several reasons, the last of which was, that\ntheir posterity would in a few generations become Dutch, and so lose\ntheir interest in the English nation; they being desirous rather\nto enlarge His Majesty's dominions, and to live under their natural\nprince.--Translator's Note.]\n\nThe emigrants were about 150 in number, including the women and the\nchildren. Their object was to plant a colony on the shores of the\nHudson; but after having been driven about for some time in the Atlantic\nOcean, they were forced to land on that arid coast of New England which\nis now the site of the town of Plymouth. The rock is still shown on\nwhich the pilgrims disembarked. *h\n\n[Footnote h: This rock is become an object of veneration in the United\nStates. I have seen bits of it carefully preserved in several towns of\nthe Union. Does not this sufficiently show how entirely all human power\nand greatness is in the soul of man? Here is a stone which the feet of\na few outcasts pressed for an instant, and this stone becomes famous; it\nis treasured by a great nation, its very dust is shared as a relic: and\nwhat is become of the gateways of a thousand palaces?]\n\n\"But before we pass on,\" continues our historian, \"let the reader\nwith me make a pause and seriously consider this poor people's present\ncondition, the more to be raised up to admiration of God's goodness\ntowards them in their preservation: for being now passed the vast\nocean, and a sea of troubles before them in expectation, they had now\nno friends to welcome them, no inns to entertain or refresh them, no\nhouses, or much less towns to repair unto to seek for succour: and for\nthe season it was winter, and they that know the winters of the country\nknow them to be sharp and violent, subject to cruel and fierce storms,\ndangerous to travel to known places, much more to search unknown coasts.\nBesides, what could they see but a hideous and desolate wilderness, full\nof wilde beasts, and wilde men? and what multitudes of them there were,\nthey then knew not: for which way soever they turned their eyes (save\nupward to Heaven) they could have but little solace or content in\nrespect of any outward object; for summer being ended, all things stand\nin appearance with a weather-beaten face, and the whole country full of\nwoods and thickets, represented a wild and savage hew; if they looked\nbehind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had passed, and was\nnow as a main bar or gulph to separate them from all the civil parts of\nthe world.\"\n\nIt must not be imagined that the piety of the Puritans was of a merely\nspeculative kind, or that it took no cognizance of the course of worldly\naffairs. Puritanism, as I have already remarked, was scarcely less a\npolitical than a religious doctrine. No sooner had the emigrants landed\non the barren coast described by Nathaniel Morton than it was their\nfirst care to constitute a society, by passing the following Act:\n\n\"In the name of God. Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal\nsubjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, etc., etc., Having\nundertaken for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian Faith,\nand the honour of our King and country, a voyage to plant the first\ncolony in the northern parts of Virginia; Do by these presents solemnly\nand mutually, in the presence of God and one another, covenant and\ncombine ourselves together into a civil body politick, for our better\nordering and preservation, and furtherance of the ends aforesaid: and by\nvirtue hereof do enact, constitute and frame such just and equal laws,\nordinances, acts, constitutions, and officers, from time to time, as\nshall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the\nColony: unto which we promise all due submission and obedience,\" etc. *i\n\n[Footnote i: The emigrants who founded the State of Rhode Island in\n1638, those who landed at New Haven in 1637, the first settlers in\nConnecticut in 1639, and the founders of Providence in 1640, began in\nlike manner by drawing up a social contract, which was acceded to by all\nthe interested parties. See \"Pitkin's History,\" pp. 42 and 47.]\n\nThis happened in 1620, and from that time forwards the emigration went\non. The religious and political passions which ravaged the British\nEmpire during the whole reign of Charles I drove fresh crowds of\nsectarians every year to the shores of America. In England the\nstronghold of Puritanism was in the middle classes, and it was from the\nmiddle classes that the majority of the emigrants came. The population\nof New England increased rapidly; and whilst the hierarchy of rank\ndespotically classed the inhabitants of the mother-country, the colony\ncontinued to present the novel spectacle of a community homogeneous in\nall its parts. A democracy, more perfect than any which antiquity had\ndreamt of, started in full size and panoply from the midst of an ancient\nfeudal society.\n\n\n\n\nChapter II: Origin Of The Anglo-Americans--Part II\n\n\nThe English Government was not dissatisfied with an emigration which\nremoved the elements of fresh discord and of further revolutions. On the\ncontrary, everything was done to encourage it, and great exertions were\nmade to mitigate the hardships of those who sought a shelter from the\nrigor of their country's laws on the soil of America. It seemed as\nif New England was a region given up to the dreams of fancy and the\nunrestrained experiments of innovators.\n\nThe English colonies (and this is one of the main causes of their\nprosperity) have always enjoyed more internal freedom and more political\nindependence than the colonies of other nations; but this principle of\nliberty was nowhere more extensively applied than in the States of New\nEngland.\n\nIt was generally allowed at that period that the territories of the\nNew World belonged to that European nation which had been the first to\ndiscover them. Nearly the whole coast of North America thus became a\nBritish possession towards the end of the sixteenth century. The means\nused by the English Government to people these new domains were of\nseveral kinds; the King sometimes appointed a governor of his own\nchoice, who ruled a portion of the New World in the name and under the\nimmediate orders of the Crown; *j this is the colonial system adopted by\nother countries of Europe. Sometimes grants of certain tracts were made\nby the Crown to an individual or to a company, *k in which case all the\ncivil and political power fell into the hands of one or more persons,\nwho, under the inspection and control of the Crown, sold the lands and\ngoverned the inhabitants. Lastly, a third system consisted in allowing a\ncertain number of emigrants to constitute a political society under the\nprotection of the mother-country, and to govern themselves in whatever\nwas not contrary to her laws. This mode of colonization, so remarkably\nfavorable to liberty, was only adopted in New England. *l\n\n[Footnote j: This was the case in the State of New York.]\n\n[Footnote k: Maryland, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were\nin this situation. See \"Pitkin's History,\" vol. i. pp. 11-31.]\n\n[Footnote l: See the work entitled \"Historical Collection of State\nPapers and other authentic Documents intended as materials for a History\nof the United States of America, by Ebenezer Hasard. Philadelphia,\n1792,\" for a great number of documents relating to the commencement\nof the colonies, which are valuable from their contents and their\nauthenticity: amongst them are the various charters granted by the King\nof England, and the first acts of the local governments.\n\nSee also the analysis of all these charters given by Mr. Story, Judge\nof the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Introduction to his\n\"Commentary on the Constitution of the United States.\" It results from\nthese documents that the principles of representative government and\nthe external forms of political liberty were introduced into all the\ncolonies at their origin. These principles were more fully acted upon in\nthe North than in the South, but they existed everywhere.]\n\nIn 1628 *m a charter of this kind was granted by Charles I to the\nemigrants who went to form the colony of Massachusetts. But, in general,\ncharters were not given to the colonies of New England till they had\nacquired a certain existence. Plymouth, Providence, New Haven, the State\nof Connecticut, and that of Rhode Island *n were founded without the\nco-operation and almost without the knowledge of the mother-country.\nThe new settlers did not derive their incorporation from the seat of\nthe empire, although they did not deny its supremacy; they constituted\na society of their own accord, and it was not till thirty or forty\nyears afterwards, under Charles II. that their existence was legally\nrecognized by a royal charter.\n\n[Footnote m: See \"Pitkin's History,\" p, 35. See the \"History of the\nColony of Massachusetts Bay,\" by Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 9.] [Footnote n:\nSee \"Pitkin's History,\" pp. 42, 47.]\n\nThis frequently renders its it difficult to detect the link which\nconnected the emigrants with the land of their forefathers in studying\nthe earliest historical and legislative records of New England. They\nexercised the rights of sovereignty; they named their magistrates,\nconcluded peace or declared war, made police regulations, and enacted\nlaws as if their allegiance was due only to God. *o Nothing can be more\ncurious and, at the same time more instructive, than the legislation of\nthat period; it is there that the solution of the great social problem\nwhich the United States now present to the world is to be found.\n\n[Footnote o: The inhabitants of Massachusetts had deviated from the\nforms which are preserved in the criminal and civil procedure of\nEngland; in 1650 the decrees of justice were not yet headed by the royal\nstyle. See Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 452.]\n\nAmongst these documents we shall notice, as especially characteristic,\nthe code of laws promulgated by the little State of Connecticut in 1650.\n*p The legislators of Connecticut *q begin with the penal laws, and,\nstrange to say, they borrow their provisions from the text of Holy Writ.\n\"Whosoever shall worship any other God than the Lord,\" says the preamble\nof the Code, \"shall surely be put to death.\" This is followed by ten or\ntwelve enactments of the same kind, copied verbatim from the books of\nExodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Blasphemy, sorcery, adultery, *r\nand rape were punished with death; an outrage offered by a son to his\nparents was to be expiated by the same penalty. The legislation of a\nrude and half-civilized people was thus applied to an enlightened and\nmoral community. The consequence was that the punishment of death was\nnever more frequently prescribed by the statute, and never more rarely\nenforced towards the guilty.\n\n[Footnote p: Code of 1650, p. 28; Hartford, 1830.]\n\n[Footnote q: See also in \"Hutchinson's History,\" vol. i. pp. 435,\n456, the analysis of the penal code adopted in 1648 by the Colony of\nMassachusetts: this code is drawn up on the same principles as that of\nConnecticut.]\n\n[Footnote r: Adultery was also punished with death by the law of\nMassachusetts: and Hutchinson, vol. i. p. 441, says that several persons\nactually suffered for this crime. He quotes a curious anecdote on\nthis subject, which occurred in the year 1663. A married woman had had\ncriminal intercourse with a young man; her husband died, and she married\nthe lover. Several years had elapsed, when the public began to suspect\nthe previous intercourse of this couple: they were thrown into prison,\nput upon trial, and very narrowly escaped capital punishment.]\n\nThe chief care of the legislators, in this body of penal laws, was the\nmaintenance of orderly conduct and good morals in the community: they\nconstantly invaded the domain of conscience, and there was scarcely a\nsin which was not subject to magisterial censure. The reader is aware of\nthe rigor with which these laws punished rape and adultery; intercourse\nbetween unmarried persons was likewise severely repressed. The judge was\nempowered to inflict a pecuniary penalty, a whipping, or marriage *s on\nthe misdemeanants; and if the records of the old courts of New Haven may\nbe believed, prosecutions of this kind were not unfrequent. We find\na sentence bearing date the first of May, 1660, inflicting a fine and\nreprimand on a young woman who was accused of using improper language,\nand of allowing herself to be kissed. *t The Code of 1650 abounds in\npreventive measures. It punishes idleness and drunkenness with severity.\n*u Innkeepers are forbidden to furnish more than a certain quantity of\nliquor to each consumer; and simple lying, whenever it may be injurious,\n*v is checked by a fine or a flogging. In other places, the legislator,\nentirely forgetting the great principles of religious toleration which\nhe had himself upheld in Europe, renders attendance on divine service\ncompulsory, *w and goes so far as to visit with severe punishment, **\nand even with death, the Christians who chose to worship God according\nto a ritual differing from his own. *x Sometimes indeed the zeal of his\nenactments induces him to descend to the most frivolous particulars:\nthus a law is to be found in the same Code which prohibits the use\nof tobacco. *y It must not be forgotten that these fantastical and\nvexatious laws were not imposed by authority, but that they were\nfreely voted by all the persons interested, and that the manners of the\ncommunity were even more austere and more puritanical than the laws.\nIn 1649 a solemn association was formed in Boston to check the worldly\nluxury of long hair. *z\n\n[Footnote s: Code of 1650, p. 48. It seems sometimes to have happened\nthat the judges superadded these punishments to each other, as is seen\nin a sentence pronounced in 1643 (p. 114, \"New Haven Antiquities\"), by\nwhich Margaret Bedford, convicted of loose conduct, was condemned to be\nwhipped, and afterwards to marry Nicholas Jemmings, her accomplice.]\n\n[Footnote t: \"New Haven Antiquities,\" p. 104.

See, for instance,\nthe law which, on September 13, 1644, banished the Anabaptists from the\nState of Massachusetts. (\"Historical Collection of State Papers,\" vol.\ni. p. 538.) See also the law against the Quakers, passed on October 14,\n1656: \"Whereas,\" says the preamble, \"an accursed race of heretics called\nQuakers has sprung up,\" etc. The clauses of the statute inflict a\nheavy fine on all captains of ships who should import Quakers into\nthe country.

See Appendix, E.]\n\nThese errors are no doubt discreditable to human reason; they attest the\ninferiority of our nature, which is incapable of laying firm hold upon\nwhat is true and just, and is often reduced to the alternative of two\nexcesses. In strict connection with this penal legislation, which bears\nsuch striking marks of a narrow sectarian spirit, and of those religious\npassions which had been warmed by persecution and were still fermenting\namong the people, a body of political laws is to be found, which, though\nwritten two hundred years ago, is still ahead of the liberties of\nour age. The general principles which are the groundwork of modern\nconstitutions--principles which were imperfectly known in Europe, and\nnot completely triumphant even in Great Britain, in the seventeenth\ncentury--were all recognized and determined by the laws of New England:\nthe intervention of the people in public affairs, the free voting of\ntaxes, the responsibility of authorities, personal liberty, and trial\nby jury, were all positively established without discussion. From these\nfruitful principles consequences have been derived and applications have\nbeen made such as no nation in Europe has yet ventured to attempt.\n\nIn Connecticut the electoral body consisted, from its origin, of the\nwhole number of citizens; and this is readily to be understood, *a when\nwe recollect that this people enjoyed an almost perfect equality of\nfortune, and a still greater uniformity of opinions. *b In Connecticut,\nat this period, all the executive functionaries were elected, including\nthe Governor of the State. *c The citizens above the age of sixteen were\nobliged to bear arms; they formed a national militia, which appointed\nits own officers, and was to hold itself at all times in readiness to\nmarch for the defence of the country. *d\n\n[Footnote a: Constitution of 1638, p. 17.]\n\n[Footnote b: In 1641 the General Assembly of Rhode Island unanimously\ndeclared that the government of the State was a democracy, and that the\npower was vested in the body of free citizens, who alone had the right\nto make the laws and to watch their execution.--Code of 1650, p. 70.]\n\n[Footnote c: \"Pitkin's History,\" p. 47.]\n\n[Footnote d: Constitution of 1638, p. 12.]\n\nIn the laws of Connecticut, as well as in all those of New England,\nwe find the germ and gradual development of that township independence\nwhich is the life and mainspring of American liberty at the present\nday. The political existence of the majority of the nations of Europe\ncommenced in the superior ranks of society, and was gradually and\nimperfectly communicated to the different members of the social body.\nIn America, on the other hand, it may be said that the township was\norganized before the county, the county before the State, the State\nbefore the Union. In New England townships were completely and\ndefinitively constituted as early as 1650. The independence of the\ntownship was the nucleus round which the local interests, passions,\nrights, and duties collected and clung. It gave scope to the activity\nof a real political life most thoroughly democratic and republican. The\ncolonies still recognized the supremacy of the mother-country; monarchy\nwas still the law of the State; but the republic was already established\nin every township. The towns named their own magistrates of every kind,\nrated themselves, and levied their own taxes. *e In the parish of New\nEngland the law of representation was not adopted, but the affairs of\nthe community were discussed, as at Athens, in the market-place, by a\ngeneral assembly of the citizens.\n\n[Footnote e: Code of 1650, p. 80.]\n\nIn studying the laws which were promulgated at this first era of the\nAmerican republics, it is impossible not to be struck by the remarkable\nacquaintance with the science of government and the advanced theory of\nlegislation which they display. The ideas there formed of the duties\nof society towards its members are evidently much loftier and more\ncomprehensive than those of the European legislators at that time:\nobligations were there imposed which were elsewhere slighted. In the\nStates of New England, from the first, the condition of the poor was\nprovided for; *f strict measures were taken for the maintenance of\nroads, and surveyors were appointed to attend to them; *g registers\nwere established in every parish, in which the results of public\ndeliberations, and the births, deaths, and marriages of the citizens\nwere entered; *h clerks were directed to keep these registers; *i\nofficers were charged with the administration of vacant inheritances,\nand with the arbitration of litigated landmarks; and many others were\ncreated whose chief functions were the maintenance of public order in\nthe community. *j The law enters into a thousand useful provisions for\na number of social wants which are at present very inadequately felt in\nFrance. [Footnote f: Ibid., p. 78.]\n\n[Footnote g: Ibid., p. 49.]\n\n[Footnote h: See \"Hutchinson's History,\" vol. i. p. 455.]\n\n[Footnote i: Code of 1650, p. 86.]\n\n[Footnote j: Ibid., p. 40.]\n\nBut it is by the attention it pays to Public Education that the original\ncharacter of American civilization is at once placed in the clearest\nlight. \"It being,\" says the law, \"one chief project of Satan to keep\nmen from the knowledge of the Scripture by persuading from the use of\ntongues, to the end that learning may not be buried in the graves of\nour forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our\nendeavors. . . .\" *k Here follow clauses establishing schools in every\ntownship, and obliging the inhabitants, under pain of heavy fines, to\nsupport them. Schools of a superior kind were founded in the same manner\nin the more populous districts. The municipal authorities were bound to\nenforce the sending of children to school by their parents; they were\nempowered to inflict fines upon all who refused compliance; and in case\nof continued resistance society assumed the place of the parent, took\npossession of the child, and deprived the father of those natural rights\nwhich he used to so bad a purpose. The reader will undoubtedly have\nremarked the preamble of these enactments: in America religion is the\nroad to knowledge, and the observance of the divine laws leads man to\ncivil freedom.\n\n[Footnote k: Ibid., p. 90.]\n\nIf, after having cast a rapid glance over the state of American society\nin 1650, we turn to the condition of Europe, and more especially to that\nof the Continent, at the same period, we cannot fail to be struck\nwith astonishment. On the Continent of Europe, at the beginning of the\nseventeenth century, absolute monarchy had everywhere triumphed over the\nruins of the oligarchical and feudal liberties of the Middle Ages. Never\nwere the notions of right more completely confounded than in the midst\nof the splendor and literature of Europe; never was there less political\nactivity among the people; never were the principles of true freedom\nless widely circulated; and at that very time those principles, which\nwere scorned or unknown by the nations of Europe, were proclaimed in\nthe deserts of the New World, and were accepted as the future creed of\na great people. The boldest theories of the human reason were put into\npractice by a community so humble that not a statesman condescended to\nattend to it; and a legislation without a precedent was produced\noffhand by the imagination of the citizens. In the bosom of this\nobscure democracy, which had as yet brought forth neither generals, nor\nphilosophers, nor authors, a man might stand up in the face of a free\npeople and pronounce the following fine definition of liberty. *l\n\n[Footnote l: Mather's \"Magnalia Christi Americana,\" vol. ii. p. 13.\nThis speech was made by Winthrop; he was accused of having committed\narbitrary actions during his magistracy, but after having made\nthe speech of which the above is a fragment, he was acquitted by\nacclamation, and from that time forwards he was always re-elected\ngovernor of the State. See Marshal, vol. i. p. 166.]\n\n\"Nor would I have you to mistake in the point of your own liberty.\nThere is a liberty of a corrupt nature which is effected both by men\nand beasts to do what they list, and this liberty is inconsistent with\nauthority, impatient of all restraint; by this liberty 'sumus omnes\ndeteriores': 'tis the grand enemy of truth and peace, and all the\nordinances of God are bent against it. But there is a civil, a moral, a\nfederal liberty which is the proper end and object of authority; it is\na liberty for that only which is just and good: for this liberty you are\nto stand with the hazard of your very lives and whatsoever crosses it is\nnot authority, but a distemper thereof. This liberty is maintained in a\nway of subjection to authority; and the authority set over you will, in\nall administrations for your good, be quietly submitted unto by all but\nsuch as have a disposition to shake off the yoke and lose their true\nliberty, by their murmuring at the honor and power of authority.\"\n\nThe remarks I have made will suffice to display the character of\nAnglo-American civilization in its true light. It is the result (and\nthis should be constantly present to the mind of two distinct elements),\nwhich in other places have been in frequent hostility, but which in\nAmerica have been admirably incorporated and combined with one another.\nI allude to the spirit of Religion and the spirit of Liberty.\n\nThe settlers of New England were at the same time ardent sectarians\nand daring innovators. Narrow as the limits of some of their religious\nopinions were, they were entirely free from political prejudices. Hence\narose two tendencies, distinct but not opposite, which are constantly\ndiscernible in the manners as well as in the laws of the country.\n\nIt might be imagined that men who sacrificed their friends, their\nfamily, and their native land to a religious conviction were absorbed\nin the pursuit of the intellectual advantages which they purchased at\nso dear a rate. The energy, however, with which they strove for the\nacquirement of wealth, moral enjoyment, and the comforts as well as\nliberties of the world, is scarcely inferior to that with which they\ndevoted themselves to Heaven.\n\nPolitical principles and all human laws and institutions were moulded\nand altered at their pleasure; the barriers of the society in which they\nwere born were broken down before them; the old principles which had\ngoverned the world for ages were no more; a path without a turn and\na field without an horizon were opened to the exploring and ardent\ncuriosity of man: but at the limits of the political world he checks\nhis researches, he discreetly lays aside the use of his most formidable\nfaculties, he no longer consents to doubt or to innovate, but carefully\nabstaining from raising the curtain of the sanctuary, he yields with\nsubmissive respect to truths which he will not discuss. Thus, in the\nmoral world everything is classed, adapted, decided, and foreseen; in\nthe political world everything is agitated, uncertain, and disputed:\nin the one is a passive, though a voluntary, obedience; in the other an\nindependence scornful of experience and jealous of authority.\n\nThese two tendencies, apparently so discrepant, are far from\nconflicting; they advance together, and mutually support each other.\nReligion perceives that civil liberty affords a noble exercise to the\nfaculties of man, and that the political world is a field prepared by\nthe Creator for the efforts of the intelligence. Contented with the\nfreedom and the power which it enjoys in its own sphere, and with the\nplace which it occupies, the empire of religion is never more surely\nestablished than when it reigns in the hearts of men unsupported by\naught beside its native strength. Religion is no less the companion of\nliberty in all its battles and its triumphs; the cradle of its infancy,\nand the divine source of its claims. The safeguard of morality is\nreligion, and morality is the best security of law and the surest pledge\nof freedom. *m\n\n[Footnote m: See Appendix, F.]\n\nReasons Of Certain Anomalies Which The Laws And Customs Of The\nAnglo-Americans Present\n\nRemains of aristocratic institutions in the midst of a complete\ndemocracy--Why?--Distinction carefully to be drawn between what is of\nPuritanical and what is of English origin.\n\nThe reader is cautioned not to draw too general or too absolute an\ninference from what has been said. The social condition, the religion,\nand the manners of the first emigrants undoubtedly exercised an immense\ninfluence on the destiny of their new country. Nevertheless they were\nnot in a situation to found a state of things solely dependent on\nthemselves: no man can entirely shake off the influence of the past, and\nthe settlers, intentionally or involuntarily, mingled habits and notions\nderived from their education and from the traditions of their country\nwith those habits and notions which were exclusively their own. To form\na judgment on the Anglo-Americans of the present day it is therefore\nnecessary to distinguish what is of Puritanical and what is of English\norigin.\n\nLaws and customs are frequently to be met with in the United States\nwhich contrast strongly with all that surrounds them. These laws seem to\nbe drawn up in a spirit contrary to the prevailing tenor of the American\nlegislation; and these customs are no less opposed to the tone of\nsociety. If the English colonies had been founded in an age of darkness,\nor if their origin was already lost in the lapse of years, the problem\nwould be insoluble.\n\nI shall quote a single example to illustrate what I advance. The\ncivil and criminal procedure of the Americans has only two means of\naction--committal and bail. The first measure taken by the magistrate\nis to exact security from the defendant, or, in case of refusal, to\nincarcerate him: the ground of the accusation and the importance of the\ncharges against him are then discussed. It is evident that a legislation\nof this kind is hostile to the poor man, and favorable only to the\nrich. The poor man has not always a security to produce, even in a\ncivil cause; and if he is obliged to wait for justice in prison, he is\nspeedily reduced to distress. The wealthy individual, on the contrary,\nalways escapes imprisonment in civil causes; nay, more, he may readily\nelude the punishment which awaits him for a delinquency by breaking his\nbail. So that all the penalties of the law are, for him, reducible\nto fines. *n Nothing can be more aristocratic than this system of\nlegislation. Yet in America it is the poor who make the law, and they\nusually reserve the greatest social advantages to themselves. The\nexplanation of the phenomenon is to be found in England; the laws of\nwhich I speak are English, *o and the Americans have retained them,\nhowever repugnant they may be to the tenor of their legislation and the\nmass of their ideas. Next to its habits, the thing which a nation\nis least apt to change is its civil legislation. Civil laws are only\nfamiliarly known to legal men, whose direct interest it is to maintain\nthem as they are, whether good or bad, simply because they themselves\nare conversant with them. The body of the nation is scarcely acquainted\nwith them; it merely perceives their action in particular cases; but it\nhas some difficulty in seizing their tendency, and obeys them without\npremeditation. I have quoted one instance where it would have been easy\nto adduce a great number of others. The surface of American society is,\nif I may use the expression, covered with a layer of democracy, from\nbeneath which the old aristocratic colors sometimes peep.\n\n[Footnote n: Crimes no doubt exist for which bail is inadmissible, but\nthey are few in number.]\n\n[Footnote o: See Blackstone; and Delolme, book I chap. x.]\n\n\n\n\nChapter III: Social Conditions Of The Anglo-Americans\n\nChapter Summary\n\nA Social condition is commonly the result of circumstances, sometimes of\nlaws, oftener still of these two causes united; but wherever it exists,\nit may justly be considered as the source of almost all the laws, the\nusages, and the ideas which regulate the conduct of nations; whatever\nit does not produce it modifies. It is therefore necessary, if we would\nbecome acquainted with the legislation and the manners of a nation, to\nbegin by the study of its social condition.\n\nThe Striking Characteristic Of The Social Condition Of The\nAnglo-Americans In Its Essential Democracy.\n\nThe first emigrants of New England--Their equality--Aristocratic laws\nintroduced in the South--Period of the Revolution--Change in the law\nof descent--Effects produced by this change--Democracy carried to its\nutmost limits in the new States of the West--Equality of education.\n\nMany important observations suggest themselves upon the social condition\nof the Anglo-Americans, but there is one which takes precedence of all\nthe rest. The social condition of the Americans is eminently democratic;\nthis was its character at the foundation of the Colonies, and is still\nmore strongly marked at the present day. I have stated in the preceding\nchapter that great equality existed among the emigrants who settled on\nthe shores of New England. The germ of aristocracy was never planted in\nthat part of the Union. The only influence which obtained there was that\nof intellect; the people were used to reverence certain names as the\nemblems of knowledge and virtue. Some of their fellow-citizens acquired\na power over the rest which might truly have been called aristocratic,\nif it had been capable of transmission from father to son.\n\nThis was the state of things to the east of the Hudson: to the\nsouth-west of that river, and in the direction of the Floridas, the case\nwas different. In most of the States situated to the south-west of the\nHudson some great English proprietors had settled, who had imported\nwith them aristocratic principles and the English law of descent. I have\nexplained the reasons why it was impossible ever to establish a powerful\naristocracy in America; these reasons existed with less force to the\nsouth-west of the Hudson. In the South, one man, aided by slaves, could\ncultivate a great extent of country: it was therefore common to see rich\nlanded proprietors. But their influence was not altogether aristocratic\nas that term is understood in Europe, since they possessed no\nprivileges; and the cultivation of their estates being carried on by\nslaves, they had no tenants depending on them, and consequently no\npatronage. Still, the great proprietors south of the Hudson constituted\na superior class, having ideas and tastes of its own, and forming the\ncentre of political action. This kind of aristocracy sympathized with\nthe body of the people, whose passions and interests it easily embraced;\nbut it was too weak and too short-lived to excite either love or hatred\nfor itself. This was the class which headed the insurrection in the\nSouth, and furnished the best leaders of the American revolution.\n\nAt the period of which we are now speaking society was shaken to\nits centre: the people, in whose name the struggle had taken place,\nconceived the desire of exercising the authority which it had acquired;\nits democratic tendencies were awakened; and having thrown off the yoke\nof the mother-country, it aspired to independence of every kind. The\ninfluence of individuals gradually ceased to be felt, and custom and law\nunited together to produce the same result.\n\nBut the law of descent was the last step to equality. I am surprised\nthat ancient and modern jurists have not attributed to this law a\ngreater influence on human affairs. *a It is true that these laws belong\nto civil affairs; but they ought nevertheless to be placed at the head\nof all political institutions; for, whilst political laws are only the\nsymbol of a nation's condition, they exercise an incredible influence\nupon its social state. They have, moreover, a sure and uniform manner of\noperating upon society, affecting, as it were, generations yet unborn.\n\n[Footnote a: I understand by the law of descent all those laws whose\nprincipal object is to regulate the distribution of property after the\ndeath of its owner. The law of entail is of this number; it certainly\nprevents the owner from disposing of his possessions before his death;\nbut this is solely with the view of preserving them entire for the heir.\nThe principal object, therefore, of the law of entail is to regulate the\ndescent of property after the death of its owner: its other provisions\nare merely means to this end.]\n\nThrough their means man acquires a kind of preternatural power over the\nfuture lot of his fellow-creatures. When the legislator has regulated\nthe law of inheritance, he may rest from his labor. The machine once put\nin motion will go on for ages, and advance, as if self-guided, towards a\ngiven point. When framed in a particular manner, this law unites, draws\ntogether, and vests property and power in a few hands: its tendency is\nclearly aristocratic. On opposite principles its action is still more\nrapid; it divides, distributes, and disperses both property and power.\nAlarmed by the rapidity of its progress, those who despair of arresting\nits motion endeavor to obstruct it by difficulties and impediments;\nthey vainly seek to counteract its effect by contrary efforts; but it\ngradually reduces or destroys every obstacle, until by its incessant\nactivity the bulwarks of the influence of wealth are ground down to the\nfine and shifting sand which is the basis of democracy. When the law of\ninheritance permits, still more when it decrees, the equal division of\na father's property amongst all his children, its effects are of two\nkinds: it is important to distinguish them from each other, although\nthey tend to the same end.\n\nIn virtue of the law of partible inheritance, the death of every\nproprietor brings about a kind of revolution in property; not only do\nhis possessions change hands, but their very nature is altered, since\nthey are parcelled into shares, which become smaller and smaller at each\ndivision. This is the direct and, as it were, the physical effect of the\nlaw. It follows, then, that in countries where equality of inheritance\nis established by law, property, and especially landed property, must\nhave a tendency to perpetual diminution. The effects, however, of such\nlegislation would only be perceptible after a lapse of time, if the law\nwas abandoned to its own working; for supposing the family to consist of\ntwo children (and in a country people as France is the average number\nis not above three), these children, sharing amongst them the fortune of\nboth parents, would not be poorer than their father or mother.\n\nBut the law of equal division exercises its influence not merely upon\nthe property itself, but it affects the minds of the heirs, and brings\ntheir passions into play. These indirect consequences tend powerfully\nto the destruction of large fortunes, and especially of large domains.\nAmong nations whose law of descent is founded upon the right of\nprimogeniture landed estates often pass from generation to generation\nwithout undergoing division, the consequence of which is that family\nfeeling is to a certain degree incorporated with the estate. The family\nrepresents the estate, the estate the family; whose name, together with\nits origin, its glory, its power, and its virtues, is thus perpetuated\nin an imperishable memorial of the past and a sure pledge of the future.\n\nWhen the equal partition of property is established by law, the intimate\nconnection is destroyed between family feeling and the preservation of\nthe paternal estate; the property ceases to represent the family; for\nas it must inevitably be divided after one or two generations, it\nhas evidently a constant tendency to diminish, and must in the end be\ncompletely dispersed. The sons of the great landed proprietor, if they\nare few in number, or if fortune befriends them, may indeed entertain\nthe hope of being as wealthy as their father, but not that of possessing\nthe same property as he did; the riches must necessarily be composed of\nelements different from his.\n\nNow, from the moment that you divest the landowner of that interest in\nthe preservation of his estate which he derives from association, from\ntradition, and from family pride, you may be certain that sooner or\nlater he will dispose of it; for there is a strong pecuniary interest in\nfavor of selling, as floating capital produces higher interest than real\nproperty, and is more readily available to gratify the passions of the\nmoment.\n\nGreat landed estates which have once been divided never come together\nagain; for the small proprietor draws from his land a better revenue, in\nproportion, than the large owner does from his, and of course he sells\nit at a higher rate. *b The calculations of gain, therefore, which\ndecide the rich man to sell his domain will still more powerfully\ninfluence him against buying small estates to unite them into a large\none.\n\n[Footnote b: I do not mean to say that the small proprietor cultivates\nhis land better, but he cultivates it with more ardor and care; so that\nhe makes up by his labor for his want of skill.]\n\nWhat is called family pride is often founded upon an illusion of\nself-love. A man wishes to perpetuate and immortalize himself, as it\nwere, in his great-grandchildren. Where the esprit de famille ceases\nto act individual selfishness comes into play. When the idea of family\nbecomes vague, indeterminate, and uncertain, a man thinks of his\npresent convenience; he provides for the establishment of his succeeding\ngeneration, and no more. Either a man gives up the idea of perpetuating\nhis family, or at any rate he seeks to accomplish it by other means\nthan that of a landed estate. Thus not only does the law of partible\ninheritance render it difficult for families to preserve their ancestral\ndomains entire, but it deprives them of the inclination to attempt it,\nand compels them in some measure to co-operate with the law in their own\nextinction.\n\nThe law of equal distribution proceeds by two methods: by acting upon\nthings, it acts upon persons; by influencing persons, it affects things.\nBy these means the law succeeds in striking at the root of landed\nproperty, and dispersing rapidly both families and fortunes. *c\n\n[Footnote c: Land being the most stable kind of property, we find, from\ntime to time, rich individuals who are disposed to make great sacrifices\nin order to obtain it, and who willingly forfeit a considerable part of\ntheir income to make sure of the rest. But these are accidental cases.\nThe preference for landed property is no longer found habitually in any\nclass but among the poor. The small landowner, who has less information,\nless imagination, and fewer passions than the great one, is generally\noccupied with the desire of increasing his estate: and it often happens\nthat by inheritance, by marriage, or by the chances of trade, he is\ngradually furnished with the means. Thus, to balance the tendency which\nleads men to divide their estates, there exists another, which incites\nthem to add to them. This tendency, which is sufficient to prevent\nestates from being divided ad infinitum, is not strong enough to create\ngreat territorial possessions, certainly not to keep them up in the same\nfamily.]\n\nMost certainly it is not for us Frenchmen of the nineteenth century,\nwho daily witness the political and social changes which the law\nof partition is bringing to pass, to question its influence. It is\nperpetually conspicuous in our country, overthrowing the walls of our\ndwellings and removing the landmarks of our fields. But although it has\nproduced great effects in France, much still remains for it to do. Our\nrecollections, opinions, and habits present powerful obstacles to its\nprogress.\n\nIn the United States it has nearly completed its work of destruction,\nand there we can best study its results. The English laws concerning the\ntransmission of property were abolished in almost all the States at\nthe time of the Revolution. The law of entail was so modified as not\nto interrupt the free circulation of property. *d The first generation\nhaving passed away, estates began to be parcelled out, and the change\nbecame more and more rapid with the progress of time. At this moment,\nafter a lapse of a little more than sixty years, the aspect of society\nis totally altered; the families of the great landed proprietors are\nalmost all commingled with the general mass. In the State of New York,\nwhich formerly contained many of these, there are but two who still keep\ntheir heads above the stream, and they must shortly disappear. The sons\nof these opulent citizens are become merchants, lawyers, or physicians.\nMost of them have lapsed into obscurity. The last trace of hereditary\nranks and distinctions is destroyed--the law of partition has reduced\nall to one level. [Footnote d: See Appendix, G.]\n\nI do not mean that there is any deficiency of wealthy individuals in the\nUnited States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has\ntaken stronger hold on the affections of men, and where the profounder\ncontempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of\nproperty. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and\nexperience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in\nthe full enjoyment of it.\n\nThis picture, which may perhaps be thought to be overcharged, still\ngives a very imperfect idea of what is taking place in the new States\nof the West and South-west. At the end of the last century a few bold\nadventurers began to penetrate into the valleys of the Mississippi, and\nthe mass of the population very soon began to move in that direction:\ncommunities unheard of till then were seen to emerge from the wilds:\nStates whose names were not in existence a few years before claimed\ntheir place in the American Union; and in the Western settlements we may\nbehold democracy arrived at its utmost extreme. In these States,\nfounded off-hand, and, as it were, by chance, the inhabitants are but\nof yesterday. Scarcely known to one another, the nearest neighbors\nare ignorant of each other's history. In this part of the American\ncontinent, therefore, the population has not experienced the influence\nof great names and great wealth, nor even that of the natural\naristocracy of knowledge and virtue. None are there to wield that\nrespectable power which men willingly grant to the remembrance of a life\nspent in doing good before their eyes. The new States of the West are\nalready inhabited, but society has no existence among them. *e\n\n[Footnote e: This may have been true in 1832, but is not so in 1874,\nwhen great cities like Chicago and San Francisco have sprung up in\nthe Western States. But as yet the Western States exert no powerful\ninfluence on American society.---Translator's Note.]\n\nIt is not only the fortunes of men which are equal in America; even\ntheir requirements partake in some degree of the same uniformity. I do\nnot believe that there is a country in the world where, in proportion\nto the population, there are so few uninstructed and at the same time\nso few learned individuals. Primary instruction is within the reach of\neverybody; superior instruction is scarcely to be obtained by any. This\nis not surprising; it is in fact the necessary consequence of what we\nhave advanced above. Almost all the Americans are in easy circumstances,\nand can therefore obtain the first elements of human knowledge.\n\nIn America there are comparatively few who are rich enough to live\nwithout a profession. Every profession requires an apprenticeship, which\nlimits the time of instruction to the early years of life. At fifteen\nthey enter upon their calling, and thus their education ends at the age\nwhen ours begins. Whatever is done afterwards is with a view to some\nspecial and lucrative object; a science is taken up as a matter of\nbusiness, and the only branch of it which is attended to is such as\nadmits of an immediate practical application. In America most of the\nrich men were formerly poor; most of those who now enjoy leisure were\nabsorbed in business during their youth; the consequence of which is,\nthat when they might have had a taste for study they had no time for it,\nand when time is at their disposal they have no longer the inclination.\n\nThere is no class, then, in America, in which the taste for intellectual\npleasures is transmitted with hereditary fortune and leisure, and by\nwhich the labors of the intellect are held in honor. Accordingly there\nis an equal want of the desire and the power of application to these\nobjects.\n\nA middle standard is fixed in America for human knowledge. All approach\nas near to it as they can; some as they rise, others as they descend.\nOf course, an immense multitude of persons are to be found who entertain\nthe same number of ideas on religion, history, science, political\neconomy, legislation, and government. The gifts of intellect proceed\ndirectly from God, and man cannot prevent their unequal distribution.\nBut in consequence of the state of things which we have here represented\nit happens that, although the capacities of men are widely different, as\nthe Creator has doubtless intended they should be, they are submitted to\nthe same method of treatment.\n\nIn America the aristocratic element has always been feeble from its\nbirth; and if at the present day it is not actually destroyed, it is at\nany rate so completely disabled that we can scarcely assign to it any\ndegree of influence in the course of affairs. The democratic principle,\non the contrary, has gained so much strength by time, by events, and by\nlegislation, as to have become not only predominant but all-powerful.\nThere is no family or corporate authority, and it is rare to find even\nthe influence of individual character enjoy any durability.\n\nAmerica, then, exhibits in her social state a most extraordinary\nphenomenon. Men are there seen on a greater equality in point of fortune\nand intellect, or, in other words, more equal in their strength, than\nin any other country of the world, or in any age of which history has\npreserved the remembrance.\n\nPolitical Consequences Of The Social Condition Of The Anglo-Americans\n\nThe political consequences of such a social condition as this are easily\ndeducible. It is impossible to believe that equality will not eventually\nfind its way into the political world as it does everywhere else. To\nconceive of men remaining forever unequal upon one single point, yet\nequal on all others, is impossible; they must come in the end to be\nequal upon all. Now I know of only two methods of establishing equality\nin the political world; every citizen must be put in possession of\nhis rights, or rights must be granted to no one. For nations which are\narrived at the same stage of social existence as the Anglo-Americans, it\nis therefore very difficult to discover a medium between the sovereignty\nof all and the absolute power of one man: and it would be vain to deny\nthat the social condition which I have been describing is equally liable\nto each of these consequences.\n\nThere is, in fact, a manly and lawful passion for equality which excites\nmen to wish all to be powerful and honored. This passion tends to\nelevate the humble to the rank of the great; but there exists also in\nthe human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak\nto attempt to lower the powerful to their own level, and reduces men to\nprefer equality in slavery to inequality with freedom. Not that those\nnations whose social condition is democratic naturally despise liberty;\non the contrary, they have an instinctive love of it. But liberty is not\nthe chief and constant object of their desires; equality is their idol:\nthey make rapid and sudden efforts to obtain liberty, and if they miss\ntheir aim resign themselves to their disappointment; but nothing can\nsatisfy them except equality, and rather than lose it they resolve to\nperish.\n\nOn the other hand, in a State where the citizens are nearly on an\nequality, it becomes difficult for them to preserve their independence\nagainst the aggressions of power. No one among them being strong\nenough to engage in the struggle with advantage, nothing but a general\ncombination can protect their liberty. And such a union is not always to\nbe found.\n\nFrom the same social position, then, nations may derive one or the other\nof two great political results; these results are extremely different\nfrom each other, but they may both proceed from the same cause.\n\nThe Anglo-Americans are the first nations who, having been exposed\nto this formidable alternative, have been happy enough to escape\nthe dominion of absolute power. They have been allowed by their\ncircumstances, their origin, their intelligence, and especially by their\nmoral feeling, to establish and maintain the sovereignty of the people.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IV: The Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America\n\nChapter Summary\n\nIt predominates over the whole of society in America--Application\nmade of this principle by the Americans even before their\nRevolution--Development given to it by that Revolution--Gradual and\nirresistible extension of the elective qualification.\n\nThe Principle Of The Sovereignty Of The People In America\n\nWhenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed,\nit is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must\nbegin. The principle of the sovereignty of the people, which is to be\nfound, more or less, at the bottom of almost all human institutions,\ngenerally remains concealed from view. It is obeyed without being\nrecognized, or if for a moment it be brought to light, it is hastily\ncast back into the gloom of the sanctuary. \"The will of the nation\" is\none of those expressions which have been most profusely abused by the\nwily and the despotic of every age. To the eyes of some it has been\nrepresented by the venal suffrages of a few of the satellites of power;\nto others by the votes of a timid or an interested minority; and some\nhave even discovered it in the silence of a people, on the supposition\nthat the fact of submission established the right of command.\n\nIn America the principle of the sovereignty of the people is not either\nbarren or concealed, as it is with some other nations; it is recognized\nby the customs and proclaimed by the laws; it spreads freely, and\narrives without impediment at its most remote consequences. If there\nbe a country in the world where the doctrine of the sovereignty of\nthe people can be fairly appreciated, where it can be studied in its\napplication to the affairs of society, and where its dangers and its\nadvantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.\n\nI have already observed that, from their origin, the sovereignty of the\npeople was the fundamental principle of the greater number of British\ncolonies in America. It was far, however, from then exercising as much\ninfluence on the government of society as it now does. Two obstacles,\nthe one external, the other internal, checked its invasive progress. It\ncould not ostensibly disclose itself in the laws of colonies which were\nstill constrained to obey the mother-country: it was therefore obliged\nto spread secretly, and to gain ground in the provincial assemblies, and\nespecially in the townships.\n\nAmerican society was not yet prepared to adopt it with all its\nconsequences. The intelligence of New England, and the wealth of the\ncountry to the south of the Hudson (as I have shown in the preceding\nchapter), long exercised a sort of aristocratic influence, which tended\nto retain the exercise of social authority in the hands of a few. The\npublic functionaries were not universally elected, and the citizens were\nnot all of them electors. The electoral franchise was everywhere placed\nwithin certain limits, and made dependent on a certain qualification,\nwhich was exceedingly low in the North and more considerable in the\nSouth.\n\nThe American revolution broke out, and the doctrine of the sovereignty\nof the people, which had been nurtured in the townships and\nmunicipalities, took possession of the State: every class was enlisted\nin its cause; battles were fought, and victories obtained for it, until\nit became the law of laws.\n\nA no less rapid change was effected in the interior of society, where\nthe law of descent completed the abolition of local influences.\n\nAt the very time when this consequence of the laws and of the revolution\nwas apparent to every eye, victory was irrevocably pronounced in favor\nof the democratic cause. All power was, in fact, in its hands, and\nresistance was no longer possible. The higher orders submitted without\na murmur and without a struggle to an evil which was thenceforth\ninevitable. The ordinary fate of falling powers awaited them; each\nof their several members followed his own interests; and as it was\nimpossible to wring the power from the hands of a people which they\ndid not detest sufficiently to brave, their only aim was to secure its\ngood-will at any price. The most democratic laws were consequently voted\nby the very men whose interests they impaired; and thus, although the\nhigher classes did not excite the passions of the people against their\norder, they accelerated the triumph of the new state of things; so\nthat by a singular change the democratic impulse was found to be most\nirresistible in the very States where the aristocracy had the firmest\nhold. The State of Maryland, which had been founded by men of rank,\nwas the first to proclaim universal suffrage, and to introduce the most\ndemocratic forms into the conduct of its government.\n\nWhen a nation modifies the elective qualification, it may easily be\nforeseen that sooner or later that qualification will be entirely\nabolished. There is no more invariable rule in the history of society:\nthe further electoral rights are extended, the greater is the need of\nextending them; for after each concession the strength of the democracy\nincreases, and its demands increase with its strength. The ambition of\nthose who are below the appointed rate is irritated in exact proportion\nto the great number of those who are above it. The exception at last\nbecomes the rule, concession follows concession, and no stop can be made\nshort of universal suffrage.\n\nAt the present day the principle of the sovereignty of the people has\nacquired, in the United States, all the practical development which the\nimagination can conceive. It is unencumbered by those fictions which\nhave been thrown over it in other countries, and it appears in every\npossible form according to the exigency of the occasion. Sometimes the\nlaws are made by the people in a body, as at Athens; and sometimes its\nrepresentatives, chosen by universal suffrage, transact business in its\nname, and almost under its immediate control.\n\nIn some countries a power exists which, though it is in a degree foreign\nto the social body, directs it, and forces it to pursue a certain track.\nIn others the ruling force is divided, being partly within and partly\nwithout the ranks of the people. But nothing of the kind is to be seen\nin the United States; there society governs itself for itself. All power\ncentres in its bosom; and scarcely an individual is to be meet with\nwho would venture to conceive, or, still less, to express, the idea of\nseeking it elsewhere. The nation participates in the making of its laws\nby the choice of its legislators, and in the execution of them by the\nchoice of the agents of the executive government; it may almost be said\nto govern itself, so feeble and so restricted is the share left to the\nadministration, so little do the authorities forget their popular origin\nand the power from which they emanate. *a [Footnote a: See Appendix, H.]\n\n\n\n\nChapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States--Part I\n\nNecessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States Before That Of The\nUnion At Large.\n\nIt is proposed to examine in the following chapter what is the form of\ngovernment established in America on the principle of the sovereignty of\nthe people; what are its resources, its hindrances, its advantages, and\nits dangers. The first difficulty which presents itself arises from the\ncomplex nature of the constitution of the United States, which consists\nof two distinct social structures, connected and, as it were, encased\none within the other; two governments, completely separate and almost\nindependent, the one fulfilling the ordinary duties and responding to\nthe daily and indefinite calls of a community, the other circumscribed\nwithin certain limits, and only exercising an exceptional authority over\nthe general interests of the country. In short, there are twenty-four\nsmall sovereign nations, whose agglomeration constitutes the body of the\nUnion. To examine the Union before we have studied the States would\nbe to adopt a method filled with obstacles. The form of the Federal\nGovernment of the United States was the last which was adopted; and\nit is in fact nothing more than a modification or a summary of those\nrepublican principles which were current in the whole community before\nit existed, and independently of its existence. Moreover, the Federal\nGovernment is, as I have just observed, the exception; the Government\nof the States is the rule. The author who should attempt to exhibit the\npicture as a whole before he had explained its details would necessarily\nfall into obscurity and repetition.\n\nThe great political principles which govern American society at this\nday undoubtedly took their origin and their growth in the State. It\nis therefore necessary to become acquainted with the State in order to\npossess a clue to the remainder. The States which at present compose\nthe American Union all present the same features, as far as regards the\nexternal aspect of their institutions. Their political or administrative\nexistence is centred in three focuses of action, which may not inaptly\nbe compared to the different nervous centres which convey motion to the\nhuman body. The township is the lowest in order, then the county, and\nlastly the State; and I propose to devote the following chapter to the\nexamination of these three divisions.\n\nThe American System Of Townships And Municipal Bodies\n\nWhy the Author begins the examination of the political institutions with\nthe township--Its existence in all nations--Difficulty of establishing\nand preserving municipal independence--Its importance--Why the Author\nhas selected the township system of New England as the main topic of his\ndiscussion.\n\nIt is not undesignedly that I begin this subject with the Township.\nThe village or township is the only association which is so perfectly\nnatural that wherever a number of men are collected it seems to\nconstitute itself.\n\nThe town, or tithing, as the smallest division of a community, must\nnecessarily exist in all nations, whatever their laws and customs\nmay be: if man makes monarchies and establishes republics, the first\nassociation of mankind seems constituted by the hand of God. But\nalthough the existence of the township is coeval with that of man, its\nliberties are not the less rarely respected and easily destroyed. A\nnation is always able to establish great political assemblies, because\nit habitually contains a certain number of individuals fitted by their\ntalents, if not by their habits, for the direction of affairs. The\ntownship is, on the contrary, composed of coarser materials, which are\nless easily fashioned by the legislator. The difficulties which attend\nthe consolidation of its independence rather augment than diminish with\nthe increasing enlightenment of the people. A highly civilized community\nspurns the attempts of a local independence, is disgusted at its\nnumerous blunders, and is apt to despair of success before the\nexperiment is completed. Again, no immunities are so ill protected from\nthe encroachments of the supreme power as those of municipal bodies in\ngeneral: they are unable to struggle, single-handed, against a strong\nor an enterprising government, and they cannot defend their cause with\nsuccess unless it be identified with the customs of the nation and\nsupported by public opinion. Thus until the independence of townships is\namalgamated with the manners of a people it is easily destroyed, and\nit is only after a long existence in the laws that it can be thus\namalgamated. Municipal freedom is not the fruit of human device; it\nis rarely created; but it is, as it were, secretly and spontaneously\nengendered in the midst of a semi-barbarous state of society.\nThe constant action of the laws and the national habits, peculiar\ncircumstances, and above all time, may consolidate it; but there is\ncertainly no nation on the continent of Europe which has experienced\nits advantages. Nevertheless local assemblies of citizens constitute\nthe strength of free nations. Town-meetings are to liberty what primary\nschools are to science; they bring it within the people's reach, they\nteach men how to use and how to enjoy it. A nation may establish\na system of free government, but without the spirit of municipal\ninstitutions it cannot have the spirit of liberty. The transient\npassions and the interests of an hour, or the chance of circumstances,\nmay have created the external forms of independence; but the despotic\ntendency which has been repelled will, sooner or later, inevitably\nreappear on the surface.\n\nIn order to explain to the reader the general principles on which the\npolitical organization of the counties and townships of the United\nStates rests, I have thought it expedient to choose one of the States of\nNew England as an example, to examine the mechanism of its constitution,\nand then to cast a general glance over the country. The township and the\ncounty are not organized in the same manner in every part of the Union;\nit is, however, easy to perceive that the same principles have guided\nthe formation of both of them throughout the Union. I am inclined to\nbelieve that these principles have been carried further in New England\nthan elsewhere, and consequently that they offer greater facilities to\nthe observations of a stranger. The institutions of New England form\na complete and regular whole; they have received the sanction of time,\nthey have the support of the laws, and the still stronger support of the\nmanners of the community, over which they exercise the most prodigious\ninfluence; they consequently deserve our attention on every account.\n\nLimits Of The Township\n\nThe township of New England is a division which stands between the\ncommune and the canton of France, and which corresponds in general to\nthe English tithing, or town. Its average population is from two to\nthree thousand; *a so that, on the one hand, the interests of its\ninhabitants are not likely to conflict, and, on the other, men capable\nof conducting its affairs are always to be found among its citizens.\n\n[Footnote a: In 1830 there were 305 townships in the State of\nMassachusetts, and 610,014 inhabitants, which gives an average of about\n2,000 inhabitants to each township.]\n\nAuthorities Of The Township In New England\n\nThe people the source of all power here as elsewhere--Manages its own\naffairs--No corporation--The greater part of the authority vested in the\nhands of the Selectmen--How the Selectmen act--Town-meeting--Enumeration\nof the public officers of the township--Obligatory and remunerated\nfunctions.\n\nIn the township, as well as everywhere else, the people is the only\nsource of power; but in no stage of government does the body of citizens\nexercise a more immediate influence. In America the people is a master\nwhose exigencies demand obedience to the utmost limits of possibility.\n\nIn New England the majority acts by representatives in the conduct\nof the public business of the State; but if such an arrangement be\nnecessary in general affairs, in the townships, where the legislative\nand administrative action of the government is in more immediate contact\nwith the subject, the system of representation is not adopted. There is\nno corporation; but the body of electors, after having designated its\nmagistrates, directs them in everything that exceeds the simple and\nordinary executive business of the State. *b\n\n[Footnote b: The same rules are not applicable to the great towns, which\ngenerally have a mayor, and a corporation divided into two bodies; this,\nhowever, is an exception which requires the sanction of a law.--See the\nAct of February 22, 1822, for appointing the authorities of the city\nof Boston. It frequently happens that small towns as well as cities\nare subject to a peculiar administration. In 1832, 104 townships in the\nState of New York were governed in this manner.--Williams' Register.]\n\nThis state of things is so contrary to our ideas, and so different from\nour customs, that it is necessary for me to adduce some examples to\nexplain it thoroughly.\n\nThe public duties in the township are extremely numerous and minutely\ndivided, as we shall see further on; but the larger proportion of\nadministrative power is vested in the hands of a small number of\nindividuals, called \"the Selectmen.\" *c The general laws of the State\nimpose a certain number of obligations on the selectmen, which they may\nfulfil without the authorization of the body they represent, but which\nthey can only neglect on their own responsibility. The law of the State\nobliges them, for instance, to draw up the list of electors in their\ntownships; and if they omit this part of their functions, they are\nguilty of a misdemeanor. In all the affairs, however, which are\ndetermined by the town-meeting, the selectmen are the organs of the\npopular mandate, as in France the Maire executes the decree of the\nmunicipal council. They usually act upon their own responsibility, and\nmerely put in practice principles which have been previously recognized\nby the majority. But if any change is to be introduced in the existing\nstate of things, or if they wish to undertake any new enterprise, they\nare obliged to refer to the source of their power. If, for instance, a\nschool is to be established, the selectmen convoke the whole body of\nthe electors on a certain day at an appointed place; they explain the\nurgency of the case; they give their opinion on the means of satisfying\nit, on the probable expense, and the site which seems to be most\nfavorable. The meeting is consulted on these several points; it adopts\nthe principle, marks out the site, votes the rate, and confides the\nexecution of its resolution to the selectmen.\n\n[Footnote c: Three selectmen are appointed in the small townships, and\nnine in the large ones. See \"The Town-Officer,\" p. 186. See also the\nprincipal laws of the State of Massachusetts relative to the selectmen:\n\nAct of February 20, 1786, vol. i. p. 219; February 24, 1796, vol. i. p.\n488; March 7, 1801, vol. ii. p. 45; June 16, 1795, vol. i. p. 475; March\n12, 1808, vol. ii. p. 186; February 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 302; June 22,\n1797, vol. i. p. 539.]\n\nThe selectmen have alone the right of calling a town-meeting, but they\nmay be requested to do so: if ten citizens are desirous of submitting\na new project to the assent of the township, they may demand a general\nconvocation of the inhabitants; the selectmen are obliged to comply, but\nthey have only the right of presiding at the meeting. *d\n\n[Footnote d: See Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 150, Act of March 25,\n1786.]\n\nThe selectmen are elected every year in the month of April or of May.\nThe town-meeting chooses at the same time a number of other municipal\nmagistrates, who are entrusted with important administrative functions.\nThe assessors rate the township; the collectors receive the rate. A\nconstable is appointed to keep the peace, to watch the streets, and to\nforward the execution of the laws; the town-clerk records all the town\nvotes, orders, grants, births, deaths, and marriages; the treasurer\nkeeps the funds; the overseer of the poor performs the difficult task of\nsuperintending the action of the poor-laws; committee-men are\nappointed to attend to the schools and to public instruction; and the\nroad-surveyors, who take care of the greater and lesser thoroughfares\nof the township, complete the list of the principal functionaries.\nThey are, however, still further subdivided; and amongst the municipal\nofficers are to be found parish commissioners, who audit the expenses\nof public worship; different classes of inspectors, some of whom are\nto direct the citizens in case of fire; tithing-men, listers, haywards,\nchimney-viewers, fence-viewers to maintain the bounds of property,\ntimber-measurers, and sealers of weights and measures. *e\n\n[Footnote e: All these magistrates actually exist; their different\nfunctions are all detailed in a book called \"The Town-Officer,\" by Isaac\nGoodwin, Worcester, 1827; and in the \"Collection of the General Laws of\nMassachusetts,\" 3 vols., Boston, 1823.]\n\nThere are nineteen principal officers in a township. Every inhabitant\nis constrained, on the pain of being fined, to undertake these different\nfunctions; which, however, are almost all paid, in order that the poorer\ncitizens may be able to give up their time without loss. In general the\nAmerican system is not to grant a fixed salary to its functionaries.\nEvery service has its price, and they are remunerated in proportion to\nwhat they have done.\n\nExistence Of The Township\n\nEvery one the best judge of his own interest--Corollary of the principle\nof the sovereignty of the people--Application of those doctrines in the\ntownships of America--The township of New England is sovereign in\nall that concerns itself alone: subject to the State in all other\nmatters--Bond of the township and the State--In France the Government\nlends its agent to the Commune--In America the reverse occurs.\n\nI have already observed that the principle of the sovereignty of the\npeople governs the whole political system of the Anglo-Americans. Every\npage of this book will afford new instances of the same doctrine. In\nthe nations by which the sovereignty of the people is recognized every\nindividual possesses an equal share of power, and participates alike in\nthe government of the State. Every individual is, therefore, supposed\nto be as well informed, as virtuous, and as strong as any of his\nfellow-citizens. He obeys the government, not because he is inferior to\nthe authorities which conduct it, or that he is less capable than his\nneighbor of governing himself, but because he acknowledges the utility\nof an association with his fellow-men, and because he knows that no such\nassociation can exist without a regulating force. If he be a subject\nin all that concerns the mutual relations of citizens, he is free and\nresponsible to God alone for all that concerns himself. Hence arises the\nmaxim that every one is the best and the sole judge of his own private\ninterest, and that society has no right to control a man's actions,\nunless they are prejudicial to the common weal, or unless the common\nweal demands his co-operation. This doctrine is universally admitted in\nthe United States. I shall hereafter examine the general influence which\nit exercises on the ordinary actions of life; I am now speaking of the\nnature of municipal bodies.\n\nThe township, taken as a whole, and in relation to the government of the\ncountry, may be looked upon as an individual to whom the theory I\nhave just alluded to is applied. Municipal independence is therefore a\nnatural consequence of the principle of the sovereignty of the people in\nthe United States: all the American republics recognize it more or less;\nbut circumstances have peculiarly favored its growth in New England.\n\nIn this part of the Union the impulsion of political activity was given\nin the townships; and it may almost be said that each of them originally\nformed an independent nation. When the Kings of England asserted their\nsupremacy, they were contented to assume the central power of the State.\nThe townships of New England remained as they were before; and although\nthey are now subject to the State, they were at first scarcely dependent\nupon it. It is important to remember that they have not been invested\nwith privileges, but that they have, on the contrary, forfeited a\nportion of their independence to the State. The townships are only\nsubordinate to the State in those interests which I shall term social,\nas they are common to all the citizens. They are independent in all\nthat concerns themselves; and amongst the inhabitants of New England\nI believe that not a man is to be found who would acknowledge that the\nState has any right to interfere in their local interests. The towns\nof New England buy and sell, sue or are sued, augment or diminish\ntheir rates, without the slightest opposition on the part of the\nadministrative authority of the State.\n\nThey are bound, however, to comply with the demands of the community. If\nthe State is in need of money, a town can neither give nor withhold the\nsupplies. If the State projects a road, the township cannot refuse to\nlet it cross its territory; if a police regulation is made by the State,\nit must be enforced by the town. A uniform system of instruction is\norganized all over the country, and every town is bound to establish the\nschools which the law ordains. In speaking of the administration of the\nUnited States I shall have occasion to point out the means by which the\ntownships are compelled to obey in these different cases: I here merely\nshow the existence of the obligation. Strict as this obligation is,\nthe government of the State imposes it in principle only, and in its\nperformance the township resumes all its independent rights. Thus,\ntaxes are voted by the State, but they are levied and collected by the\ntownship; the existence of a school is obligatory, but the township\nbuilds, pays, and superintends it. In France the State-collector\nreceives the local imposts; in America the town-collector receives the\ntaxes of the State. Thus the French Government lends its agents to the\ncommune; in America the township is the agent of the Government. This\nfact alone shows the extent of the differences which exist between the\ntwo nations.\n\nPublic Spirit Of The Townships Of New England\n\nHow the township of New England wins the affections of its\ninhabitants--Difficulty of creating local public spirit in\nEurope--The rights and duties of the American township favorable to\nit--Characteristics of home in the United States--Manifestations of\npublic spirit in New England--Its happy effects.\n\nIn America, not only do municipal bodies exist, but they are kept alive\nand supported by public spirit. The township of New England possesses\ntwo advantages which infallibly secure the attentive interest of\nmankind, namely, independence and authority. Its sphere is indeed small\nand limited, but within that sphere its action is unrestrained; and\nits independence gives to it a real importance which its extent and\npopulation may not always ensure.\n\nIt is to be remembered that the affections of men generally lie on the\nside of authority. Patriotism is not durable in a conquered nation. The\nNew Englander is attached to his township, not only because he was born\nin it, but because it constitutes a social body of which he is a member,\nand whose government claims and deserves the exercise of his sagacity.\nIn Europe the absence of local public spirit is a frequent subject of\nregret to those who are in power; everyone agrees that there is no surer\nguarantee of order and tranquility, and yet nothing is more difficult to\ncreate. If the municipal bodies were made powerful and independent,\nthe authorities of the nation might be disunited and the peace of the\ncountry endangered. Yet, without power and independence, a town may\ncontain good subjects, but it can have no active citizens. Another\nimportant fact is that the township of New England is so constituted\nas to excite the warmest of human affections, without arousing the\nambitious passions of the heart of man. The officers of the country are\nnot elected, and their authority is very limited. Even the State is\nonly a second-rate community, whose tranquil and obscure administration\noffers no inducement sufficient to draw men away from the circle\nof their interests into the turmoil of public affairs. The federal\ngovernment confers power and honor on the men who conduct it; but\nthese individuals can never be very numerous. The high station of the\nPresidency can only be reached at an advanced period of life, and the\nother federal functionaries are generally men who have been favored\nby fortune, or distinguished in some other career. Such cannot be the\npermanent aim of the ambitious. But the township serves as a centre for\nthe desire of public esteem, the want of exciting interests, and\nthe taste for authority and popularity, in the midst of the ordinary\nrelations of life; and the passions which commonly embroil society\nchange their character when they find a vent so near the domestic hearth\nand the family circle.\n\nIn the American States power has been disseminated with admirable skill\nfor the purpose of interesting the greatest possible number of persons\nin the common weal. Independently of the electors who are from time to\ntime called into action, the body politic is divided into innumerable\nfunctionaries and officers, who all, in their several spheres, represent\nthe same powerful whole in whose name they act. The local administration\nthus affords an unfailing source of profit and interest to a vast number\nof individuals.\n\nThe American system, which divides the local authority among so many\ncitizens, does not scruple to multiply the functions of the town\nofficers. For in the United States it is believed, and with truth,\nthat patriotism is a kind of devotion which is strengthened by ritual\nobservance. In this manner the activity of the township is continually\nperceptible; it is daily manifested in the fulfilment of a duty or the\nexercise of a right, and a constant though gentle motion is thus kept up\nin society which animates without disturbing it.\n\nThe American attaches himself to his home as the mountaineer clings to\nhis hills, because the characteristic features of his country are there\nmore distinctly marked than elsewhere. The existence of the townships\nof New England is in general a happy one. Their government is suited\nto their tastes, and chosen by themselves. In the midst of the profound\npeace and general comfort which reign in America the commotions of\nmunicipal discord are unfrequent. The conduct of local business is easy.\nThe political education of the people has long been complete; say rather\nthat it was complete when the people first set foot upon the soil. In\nNew England no tradition exists of a distinction of ranks; no portion of\nthe community is tempted to oppress the remainder; and the abuses which\nmay injure isolated individuals are forgotten in the general contentment\nwhich prevails. If the government is defective (and it would no doubt\nbe easy to point out its deficiencies), the fact that it really emanates\nfrom those it governs, and that it acts, either ill or well, casts\nthe protecting spell of a parental pride over its faults. No term of\ncomparison disturbs the satisfaction of the citizen: England formerly\ngoverned the mass of the colonies, but the people was always sovereign\nin the township where its rule is not only an ancient but a primitive\nstate.\n\nThe native of New England is attached to his township because it is\nindependent and free: his co-operation in its affairs ensures his\nattachment to its interest; the well-being it affords him secures his\naffection; and its welfare is the aim of his ambition and of his\nfuture exertions: he takes a part in every occurrence in the place; he\npractises the art of government in the small sphere within his reach;\nhe accustoms himself to those forms which can alone ensure the steady\nprogress of liberty; he imbibes their spirit; he acquires a taste for\norder, comprehends the union or the balance of powers, and collects\nclear practical notions on the nature of his duties and the extent of\nhis rights.\n\nThe Counties Of New England\n\nThe division of the countries in America has considerable analogy with\nthat of the arrondissements of France. The limits of the counties are\narbitrarily laid down, and the various districts which they contain have\nno necessary connection, no common tradition or natural sympathy; their\nobject is simply to facilitate the administration of justice.\n\nThe extent of the township was too small to contain a system of judicial\ninstitutions; each county has, however, a court of justice, *f a sheriff\nto execute its decrees, and a prison for criminals. There are certain\nwants which are felt alike by all the townships of a county; it is\ntherefore natural that they should be satisfied by a central authority.\nIn the State of Massachusetts this authority is vested in the hands of\nseveral magistrates, who are appointed by the Governor of the State,\nwith the advice *g of his council. *h The officers of the county have\nonly a limited and occasional authority, which is applicable to certain\npredetermined cases. The State and the townships possess all the power\nrequisite to conduct public business. The budget of the county is drawn\nup by its officers, and is voted by the legislature, but there is no\nassembly which directly or indirectly represents the county. It has,\ntherefore, properly speaking, no political existence.\n\n[Footnote f: See the Act of February 14, 1821, Laws of Massachusetts,\nvol. i. p. 551.]\n\n[Footnote g: See the Act of February 20, 1819, Laws of Massachusetts,\nvol. ii. p. 494.]\n\n[Footnote h: The council of the Governor is an elective body.] A twofold\ntendency may be discerned in the American constitutions, which impels\nthe legislator to centralize the legislative and to disperse the\nexecutive power. The township of New England has in itself an\nindestructible element of independence; and this distinct existence\ncould only be fictitiously introduced into the county, where its\nutility has not been felt. But all the townships united have but\none representation, which is the State, the centre of the national\nauthority: beyond the action of the township and that of the nation,\nnothing can be said to exist but the influence of individual exertion.\n\nAdministration In New England\n\nAdministration not perceived in America--Why?--The Europeans believe\nthat liberty is promoted by depriving the social authority of some of\nits rights; the Americans, by dividing its exercise--Almost all the\nadministration confined to the township, and divided amongst the\ntown-officers--No trace of an administrative body to be perceived,\neither in the township or above it--The reason of this--How it happens\nthat the administration of the State is uniform--Who is empowered to\nenforce the obedience of the township and the county to the law--The\nintroduction of judicial power into the administration--Consequence\nof the extension of the elective principle to all functionaries--The\nJustice of the Peace in New England--By whom appointed--County officer:\nensures the administration of the townships--Court of Sessions--Its\naction--Right of inspection and indictment disseminated like the other\nadministrative functions--Informers encouraged by the division of fines.\n\nNothing is more striking to an European traveller in the United States\nthan the absence of what we term the Government, or the Administration.\nWritten laws exist in America, and one sees that they are daily\nexecuted; but although everything is in motion, the hand which gives the\nimpulse to the social machine can nowhere be discovered. Nevertheless,\nas all peoples are obliged to have recourse to certain grammatical\nforms, which are the foundation of human language, in order to express\ntheir thoughts; so all communities are obliged to secure their existence\nby submitting to a certain dose of authority, without which they fall a\nprey to anarchy. This authority may be distributed in several ways, but\nit must always exist somewhere.\n\nThere are two methods of diminishing the force of authority in a nation:\nThe first is to weaken the supreme power in its very principle, by\nforbidding or preventing society from acting in its own defence under\ncertain circumstances. To weaken authority in this manner is what is\ngenerally termed in Europe to lay the foundations of freedom. The second\nmanner of diminishing the influence of authority does not consist in\nstripping society of any of its rights, nor in paralyzing its efforts,\nbut in distributing the exercise of its privileges in various hands,\nand in multiplying functionaries, to each of whom the degree of power\nnecessary for him to perform his duty is entrusted. There may be nations\nwhom this distribution of social powers might lead to anarchy; but in\nitself it is not anarchical. The action of authority is indeed thus\nrendered less irresistible and less perilous, but it is not totally\nsuppressed.\n\nThe revolution of the United States was the result of a mature and\ndignified taste for freedom, and not of a vague or ill-defined craving\nfor independence. It contracted no alliance with the turbulent passions\nof anarchy; but its course was marked, on the contrary, by an attachment\nto whatever was lawful and orderly.\n\nIt was never assumed in the United States that the citizen of a free\ncountry has a right to do whatever he pleases; on the contrary, social\nobligations were there imposed upon him more various than anywhere\nelse. No idea was ever entertained of attacking the principles or of\ncontesting the rights of society; but the exercise of its authority was\ndivided, to the end that the office might be powerful and the officer\ninsignificant, and that the community should be at once regulated\nand free. In no country in the world does the law hold so absolute a\nlanguage as in America, and in no country is the right of applying it\nvested in so many hands. The administrative power in the United States\npresents nothing either central or hierarchical in its constitution,\nwhich accounts for its passing, unperceived. The power exists, but its\nrepresentative is not to be perceived.\n\nWe have already seen that the independent townships of New England\nprotect their own private interests; and the municipal magistrates\nare the persons to whom the execution of the laws of the State is most\nfrequently entrusted. *i Besides the general laws, the State sometimes\npasses general police regulations; but more commonly the townships and\ntown officers, conjointly with justices of the peace, regulate the minor\ndetails of social life, according to the necessities of the different\nlocalities, and promulgate such enactments as concern the health of the\ncommunity, and the peace as well as morality of the citizens. *j Lastly,\nthese municipal magistrates provide, of their own accord and without\nany delegated powers, for those unforeseen emergencies which frequently\noccur in society. *k\n\n[Footnote i: See \"The Town-Officer,\" especially at the words Selectmen,\nAssessors, Collectors, Schools, Surveyors of Highways. I take one\nexample in a thousand: the State prohibits travelling on the Sunday; the\ntything-men, who are town-officers, are specially charged to keep watch\nand to execute the law. See the Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 410.\n\nThe selectmen draw up the lists of electors for the election of the\nGovernor, and transmit the result of the ballot to the Secretary of the\nState. See Act of February 24, 1796: Id., vol. i. p. 488.]\n\n[Footnote j: Thus, for instance, the selectmen authorize the\nconstruction of drains, point out the proper sites for slaughter-houses\nand other trades which are a nuisance to the neighborhood. See the Act\nof June 7, 1785: Id., vol. i. p. 193.]\n\n[Footnote k: The selectmen take measures for the security of the public\nin case of contagious diseases, conjointly with the justices of the\npeace. See Act of June 22, 1797, vol. i. p. 539.]\n\nIt results from what we have said that in the State of Massachusetts the\nadministrative authority is almost entirely restricted to the township,\n*l but that it is distributed among a great number of individuals.\nIn the French commune there is properly but one official functionary,\nnamely, the Maire; and in New England we have seen that there are\nnineteen. These nineteen functionaries do not in general depend upon\none another. The law carefully prescribes a circle of action to each of\nthese magistrates; and within that circle they have an entire right to\nperform their functions independently of any other authority. Above the\ntownship scarcely any trace of a series of official dignitaries is to be\nfound. It sometimes happens that the county officers alter a decision of\nthe townships or town magistrates, *m but in general the authorities\nof the county have no right to interfere with the authorities of the\ntownship, *n except in such matters as concern the county.\n\n[Footnote l: I say almost, for there are various circumstances in the\nannals of a township which are regulated by the justice of the peace in\nhis individual capacity, or by the justices of the peace assembled in\nthe chief town of the county; thus licenses are granted by the justices.\nSee the Act of February 28, 1787, vol. i. p. 297.]\n\n[Footnote m: Thus licenses are only granted to such persons as can\nproduce a certificate of good conduct from the selectmen. If the\nselectmen refuse to give the certificate, the party may appeal to the\njustices assembled in the Court of Sessions, and they may grant the\nlicense. See Act of March 12, 1808, vol. ii. p. 186.\n\nThe townships have the right to make by-laws, and to enforce them by\nfines which are fixed by law; but these by-laws must be approved by the\nCourt of Sessions. See Act of March 23, 1786, vol. i. p. 254.]\n\n[Footnote n: In Massachusetts the county magistrates are frequently\ncalled upon to investigate the acts of the town magistrates; but it will\nbe shown further on that this investigation is a consequence, not of\ntheir administrative, but of their judicial power.]\n\nThe magistrates of the township, as well as those of the county, are\nbound to communicate their acts to the central government in a very\nsmall number of predetermined cases. *o But the central government is\nnot represented by an individual whose business it is to publish police\nregulations and ordinances enforcing the execution of the laws; to keep\nup a regular communication with the officers of the township and\nthe county; to inspect their conduct, to direct their actions, or to\nreprimand their faults. There is no point which serves as a centre to\nthe radii of the administration.\n\n[Footnote o: The town committees of schools are obliged to make an\nannual report to the Secretary of the State on the condition of the\nschool. See Act of March 10, 1827, vol. iii. p. 183.]\n\n\n\n\nChapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States--Part II\n\nWhat, then, is the uniform plan on which the government is conducted,\nand how is the compliance of the counties and their magistrates or the\ntownships and their officers enforced? In the States of New England the\nlegislative authority embraces more subjects than it does in France; the\nlegislator penetrates to the very core of the administration; the law\ndescends to the most minute details; the same enactment prescribes\nthe principle and the method of its application, and thus imposes a\nmultitude of strict and rigorously defined obligations on the secondary\nfunctionaries of the State. The consequence of this is that if all\nthe secondary functionaries of the administration conform to the law,\nsociety in all its branches proceeds with the greatest uniformity: the\ndifficulty remains of compelling the secondary functionaries of the\nadministration to conform to the law. It may be affirmed that, in\ngeneral, society has only two methods of enforcing the execution of\nthe laws at its disposal: a discretionary power may be entrusted to a\nsuperior functionary of directing all the others, and of cashiering them\nin case of disobedience; or the courts of justice may be authorized to\ninflict judicial penalties on the offender: but these two methods are\nnot always available.\n\nThe right of directing a civil officer presupposes that of cashiering\nhim if he does not obey orders, and of rewarding him by promotion if he\nfulfils his duties with propriety. But an elected magistrate can neither\nbe cashiered nor promoted. All elective functions are inalienable until\ntheir term is expired. In fact, the elected magistrate has nothing\neither to expect or to fear from his constituents; and when all\npublic offices are filled by ballot there can be no series of official\ndignities, because the double right of commanding and of enforcing\nobedience can never be vested in the same individual, and because the\npower of issuing an order can never be joined to that of inflicting a\npunishment or bestowing a reward.\n\nThe communities therefore in which the secondary functionaries of\nthe government are elected are perforce obliged to make great use of\njudicial penalties as a means of administration. This is not evident at\nfirst sight; for those in power are apt to look upon the institution\nof elective functionaries as one concession, and the subjection of\nthe elected magistrate to the judges of the land as another. They\nare equally averse to both these innovations; and as they are more\npressingly solicited to grant the former than the latter, they accede\nto the election of the magistrate, and leave him independent of the\njudicial power. Nevertheless, the second of these measures is the only\nthing that can possibly counterbalance the first; and it will be found\nthat an elective authority which is not subject to judicial power will,\nsooner or later, either elude all control or be destroyed. The courts of\njustice are the only possible medium between the central power and the\nadministrative bodies; they alone can compel the elected functionary\nto obey, without violating the rights of the elector. The extension of\njudicial power in the political world ought therefore to be in the exact\nratio of the extension of elective offices: if these two institutions\ndo not go hand in hand, the State must fall into anarchy or into\nsubjection.\n\nIt has always been remarked that habits of legal business do not render\nmen apt to the exercise of administrative authority. The Americans have\nborrowed from the English, their fathers, the idea of an institution\nwhich is unknown upon the continent of Europe: I allude to that of\nthe Justices of the Peace. The Justice of the Peace is a sort of mezzo\ntermine between the magistrate and the man of the world, between the\ncivil officer and the judge. A justice of the peace is a well-informed\ncitizen, though he is not necessarily versed in the knowledge of the\nlaws. His office simply obliges him to execute the police regulations of\nsociety; a task in which good sense and integrity are of more avail than\nlegal science. The justice introduces into the administration a certain\ntaste for established forms and publicity, which renders him a most\nunserviceable instrument of despotism; and, on the other hand, he is not\nblinded by those superstitions which render legal officers unfit members\nof a government. The Americans have adopted the system of the English\njustices of the peace, but they have deprived it of that aristocratic\ncharacter which is discernible in the mother-country. The Governor of\nMassachusetts *p appoints a certain number of justices of the peace in\nevery county, whose functions last seven years. *q He further designates\nthree individuals from amongst the whole body of justices who form in\neach county what is called the Court of Sessions. The justices take a\npersonal share in public business; they are sometimes entrusted with\nadministrative functions in conjunction with elected officers, *r they\nsometimes constitute a tribunal, before which the magistrates summarily\nprosecute a refractory citizen, or the citizens inform against the\nabuses of the magistrate. But it is in the Court of Sessions that they\nexercise their most important functions. This court meets twice a year\nin the county town; in Massachusetts it is empowered to enforce the\nobedience of the greater number *s of public officers. *t It must be\nobserved, that in the State of Massachusetts the Court of Sessions is\nat the same time an administrative body, properly so called, and a\npolitical tribunal. It has been asserted that the county is a purely\nadministrative division. The Court of Sessions presides over that small\nnumber of affairs which, as they concern several townships, or all the\ntownships of the county in common, cannot be entrusted to any one of\nthem in particular. *u In all that concerns county business the duties\nof the Court of Sessions are purely administrative; and if in its\ninvestigations it occasionally borrows the forms of judicial procedure,\nit is only with a view to its own information, *v or as a guarantee to\nthe community over which it presides. But when the administration of the\ntownship is brought before it, it always acts as a judicial body, and in\nsome few cases as an official assembly.\n\n[Footnote p: We shall hereafter learn what a Governor is: I shall\ncontent myself with remarking in this place that he represents the\nexecutive power of the whole State.]\n\n[Footnote q: See the Constitution of Massachusetts, chap. II. sect. 1.\nSection 9; chap. III. Section 3.]\n\n[Footnote r: Thus, for example, a stranger arrives in a township from\na country where a contagious disease prevails, and he falls ill. Two\njustices of the peace can, with the assent of the selectmen, order the\nsheriff of the county to remove and take care of him.--Act of June 22,\n1797, vol. i. p. 540.\n\nIn general the justices interfere in all the important acts of the\nadministration, and give them a semi-judicial character.] [Footnote s: I\nsay the greater number, because certain administrative misdemeanors are\nbrought before ordinary tribunals. If, for instance, a township\nrefuses to make the necessary expenditure for its schools or to name\na school-committee, it is liable to a heavy fine. But this penalty is\npronounced by the Supreme Judicial Court or the Court of Common Pleas.\nSee Act of March 10, 1827, Laws of Massachusetts, vol. iii. p. 190. Or\nwhen a township neglects to provide the necessary war-stores.--Act of\nFebruary 21, 1822: Id., vol. ii. p. 570.]\n\n[Footnote t: In their individual capacity the justices of the peace\ntake a part in the business of the counties and townships.] [Footnote u:\nThese affairs may be brought under the following heads:--1. The erection\nof prisons and courts of justice. 2. The county budget, which is\nafterwards voted by the State. 3. The distribution of the taxes so\nvoted. 4. Grants of certain patents. 5. The laying down and repairs of\nthe country roads.]\n\n[Footnote v: Thus, when a road is under consideration, almost all\ndifficulties are disposed of by the aid of the jury.]\n\nThe first difficulty is to procure the obedience of an authority as\nentirely independent of the general laws of the State as the\ntownship is. We have stated that assessors are annually named by the\ntown-meetings to levy the taxes. If a township attempts to evade the\npayment of the taxes by neglecting to name its assessors, the Court of\nSessions condemns it to a heavy penalty. *w The fine is levied on each\nof the inhabitants; and the sheriff of the county, who is the officer of\njustice, executes the mandate. Thus it is that in the United States the\nauthority of the Government is mysteriously concealed under the forms of\na judicial sentence; and its influence is at the same time fortified by\nthat irresistible power with which men have invested the formalities of\nlaw.\n\n[Footnote w: See Act of February 20, 1786, Laws of Massachusetts, vol.\ni. p. 217.]\n\nThese proceedings are easy to follow and to understand. The demands\nmade upon a township are in general plain and accurately defined; they\nconsist in a simple fact without any complication, or in a principle\nwithout its application in detail. *x But the difficulty increases when\nit is not the obedience of the township, but that of the town officers\nwhich is to be enforced. All the reprehensible actions of which a public\nfunctionary may be guilty are reducible to the following heads:\n\n[Footnote x: There is an indirect method of enforcing the obedience of\na township. Suppose that the funds which the law demands for the\nmaintenance of the roads have not been voted, the town surveyor is\nthen authorized, ex officio, to levy the supplies. As he is personally\nresponsible to private individuals for the state of the roads, and\nindictable before the Court of Sessions, he is sure to employ the\nextraordinary right which the law gives him against the township. Thus\nby threatening the officer the Court of Sessions exacts compliance from\nthe town. See Act of March 5, 1787, Id., vol. i. p. 305.]\n\nHe may execute the law without energy or zeal;\n\nHe may neglect to execute the law;\n\nHe may do what the law enjoins him not to do.\n\nThe last two violations of duty can alone come under the cognizance of\na tribunal; a positive and appreciable fact is the indispensable\nfoundation of an action at law. Thus, if the selectmen omit to fulfil\nthe legal formalities usual at town elections, they may be condemned\nto pay a fine; *y but when the public officer performs his duty without\nability, and when he obeys the letter of the law without zeal or energy,\nhe is at least beyond the reach of judicial interference. The Court of\nSessions, even when it is invested with its official powers, is in this\ncase unable to compel him to a more satisfactory obedience. The fear of\nremoval is the only check to these quasi-offences; and as the Court\nof Sessions does not originate the town authorities, it cannot\nremove functionaries whom it does not appoint. Moreover, a perpetual\ninvestigation would be necessary to convict the officer of negligence or\nlukewarmness; and the Court of Sessions sits but twice a year and then\nonly judges such offences as are brought before its notice. The only\nsecurity of that active and enlightened obedience which a court of\njustice cannot impose upon public officers lies in the possibility of\ntheir arbitrary removal. In France this security is sought for in powers\nexercised by the heads of the administration; in America it is sought\nfor in the principle of election.\n\n[Footnote y: Laws of Massachusetts, vol. ii. p. 45.]\n\nThus, to recapitulate in a few words what I have been showing: If a\npublic officer in New England commits a crime in the exercise of his\nfunctions, the ordinary courts of justice are always called upon to pass\nsentence upon him. If he commits a fault in his official capacity, a\npurely administrative tribunal is empowered to punish him; and, if the\naffair is important or urgent, the judge supplies the omission of the\nfunctionary. *z Lastly, if the same individual is guilty of one of\nthose intangible offences of which human justice has no cognizance, he\nannually appears before a tribunal from which there is no appeal, which\ncan at once reduce him to insignificance and deprive him of his charge.\nThis system undoubtedly possesses great advantages, but its execution is\nattended with a practical difficulty which it is important to point out.\n\n[Footnote z: If, for instance, a township persists in refusing to name\nits assessors, the Court of Sessions nominates them; and the magistrates\nthus appointed are invested with the same authority as elected officers.\nSee the Act quoted above, February 20, 1787.]\n\nI have already observed that the administrative tribunal, which is\ncalled the Court of Sessions, has no right of inspection over the town\nofficers. It can only interfere when the conduct of a magistrate is\nspecially brought under its notice; and this is the delicate part of the\nsystem. The Americans of New England are unacquainted with the office\nof public prosecutor in the Court of Sessions, *a and it may readily be\nperceived that it could not have been established without difficulty.\nIf an accusing magistrate had merely been appointed in the chief town of\neach county, and if he had been unassisted by agents in the townships,\nhe would not have been better acquainted with what was going on in the\ncounty than the members of the Court of Sessions. But to appoint agents\nin each township would have been to centre in his person the most\nformidable of powers, that of a judicial administration. Moreover,\nlaws are the children of habit, and nothing of the kind exists in the\nlegislation of England. The Americans have therefore divided the offices\nof inspection and of prosecution, as well as all the other functions\nof the administration. Grand jurors are bound by the law to apprise the\ncourt to which they belong of all the misdemeanors which may have been\ncommitted in their county. *b There are certain great offences which are\nofficially prosecuted by the States; *c but more frequently the task of\npunishing delinquents devolves upon the fiscal officer, whose province\nit is to receive the fine: thus the treasurer of the township is charged\nwith the prosecution of such administrative offences as fall under his\nnotice. But a more special appeal is made by American legislation to\nthe private interest of the citizen; *d and this great principle is\nconstantly to be met with in studying the laws of the United States.\nAmerican legislators are more apt to give men credit for intelligence\nthan for honesty, and they rely not a little on personal cupidity for\nthe execution of the laws. When an individual is really and sensibly\ninjured by an administrative abuse, it is natural that his personal\ninterest should induce him to prosecute. But if a legal formality be\nrequired, which, however advantageous to the community, is of small\nimportance to individuals, plaintiffs may be less easily found; and\nthus, by a tacit agreement, the laws may fall into disuse. Reduced by\ntheir system to this extremity, the Americans are obliged to encourage\ninformers by bestowing on them a portion of the penalty in certain\ncases, *e and to insure the execution of the laws by the dangerous\nexpedient of degrading the morals of the people. The only administrative\nauthority above the county magistrates is, properly speaking, that of\nthe Government.\n\n[Footnote a: I say the Court of Sessions, because in common courts\nthere is a magistrate who exercises some of the functions of a public\nprosecutor.]\n\n[Footnote b: The grand-jurors are, for instance, bound to inform the\ncourt of the bad state of the roads.--Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p.\n308.]\n\n[Footnote c: If, for instance, the treasurer of the county holds back\nhis accounts.--Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 406.] [Footnote d:\nThus, if a private individual breaks down or is wounded in consequence\nof the badness of a road, he can sue the township or the county for\ndamages at the sessions.--Laws of Massachusetts, vol. i. p. 309.]\n\n[Footnote e: In cases of invasion or insurrection, if the town-officers\nneglect to furnish the necessary stores and ammunition for the militia,\nthe township may be condemned to a fine of from $200 to $500. It may\nreadily be imagined that in such a case it might happen that no one\ncared to prosecute; hence the law adds that all the citizens may indict\noffences of this kind, and that half of the fine shall belong to the\nplaintiff. See Act of March 6, 1810, vol. ii. p. 236. The same clause\nis frequently to be met with in the law of Massachusetts. Not only are\nprivate individuals thus incited to prosecute the public officers,\nbut the public officers are encouraged in the same manner to bring the\ndisobedience of private individuals to justice. If a citizen refuses to\nperform the work which has been assigned to him upon a road, the\nroad surveyor may prosecute him, and he receives half the penalty for\nhimself. See the Laws above quoted, vol. i. p. 308.]\n\nGeneral Remarks On The Administration Of The United States Differences\nof the States of the Union in their system of administration--Activity\nand perfection of the local authorities decrease towards the\nSouth--Power of the magistrate increases; that of the elector\ndiminishes--Administration passes from the township to the\ncounty--States of New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania--Principles of\nadministration applicable to the whole Union--Election of public\nofficers, and inalienability of their functions--Absence of gradation of\nranks--Introduction of judicial resources into the administration.\n\n\nI have already premised that, after having examined the constitution of\nthe township and the county of New England in detail, I should take\na general view of the remainder of the Union. Townships and a local\nactivity exist in every State; but in no part of the confederation is a\ntownship to be met with precisely similar to those of New England. The\nmore we descend towards the South, the less active does the business of\nthe township or parish become; the number of magistrates, of functions,\nand of rights decreases; the population exercises a less immediate\ninfluence on affairs; town meetings are less frequent, and the subjects\nof debate less numerous. The power of the elected magistrate is\naugmented and that of the elector diminished, whilst the public spirit\nof the local communities is less awakened and less influential. *f These\ndifferences may be perceived to a certain extent in the State of New\nYork; they are very sensible in Pennsylvania; but they become less\nstriking as we advance to the northwest. The majority of the emigrants\nwho settle in the northwestern States are natives of New England, and\nthey carry the habits of their mother country with them into that which\nthey adopt. A township in Ohio is by no means dissimilar from a township\nin Massachusetts.\n\n[Footnote f: For details see the Revised Statutes of the State of New\nYork, part i. chap. xi. vol. i. pp. 336-364, entitled, \"Of the Powers,\nDuties, and Privileges of Towns.\"\n\nSee in the Digest of the Laws of Pennsylvania, the words Assessors,\nCollector, Constables, Overseer of the Poor, Supervisors of Highways;\nand in the Acts of a general nature of the State of Ohio, the Act of\nFebruary 25, 1834, relating to townships, p. 412; besides the peculiar\ndispositions relating to divers town-officers, such as Township's Clerk,\nTrustees, Overseers of the Poor, Fence Viewers, Appraisers of Property,\nTownship's Treasurer, Constables, Supervisors of Highways.]\n\nWe have seen that in Massachusetts the mainspring of public\nadministration lies in the township. It forms the common centre of the\ninterests and affections of the citizens. But this ceases to be the case\nas we descend to States in which knowledge is less generally diffused,\nand where the township consequently offers fewer guarantees of a wise\nand active administration. As we leave New England, therefore, we find\nthat the importance of the town is gradually transferred to the county,\nwhich becomes the centre of administration, and the intermediate power\nbetween the Government and the citizen. In Massachusetts the business of\nthe county is conducted by the Court of Sessions, which is composed of\na quorum named by the Governor and his council; but the county has no\nrepresentative assembly, and its expenditure is voted by the national\nlegislature. In the great State of New York, on the contrary, and in\nthose of Ohio and Pennsylvania, the inhabitants of each county choose\na certain number of representatives, who constitute the assembly of the\ncounty. *g The county assembly has the right of taxing the inhabitants\nto a certain extent; and in this respect it enjoys the privileges of a\nreal legislative body: at the same time it exercises an executive power\nin the county, frequently directs the administration of the townships,\nand restricts their authority within much narrower bounds than in\nMassachusetts.\n\n[Footnote g: See the Revised Statutes of the State of New York, part i.\nchap. xi. vol. i. p. 340. Id. chap. xii. p. 366; also in the Acts of\nthe State of Ohio, an act relating to county commissioners, February 25,\n1824, p. 263. See the Digest of the Laws of Pennsylvania, at the words\nCounty-rates and Levies, p. 170. In the State of New York each township\nelects a representative, who has a share in the administration of the\ncounty as well as in that of the township.]\n\nSuch are the principal differences which the systems of county and town\nadministration present in the Federal States. Were it my intention to\nexamine the provisions of American law minutely, I should have to point\nout still further differences in the executive details of the several\ncommunities. But what I have already said may suffice to show the\ngeneral principles on which the administration of the United States\nrests. These principles are differently applied; their consequences\nare more or less numerous in various localities; but they are always\nsubstantially the same. The laws differ, and their outward features\nchange, but their character does not vary. If the township and the\ncounty are not everywhere constituted in the same manner, it is at least\ntrue that in the United States the county and the township are always\nbased upon the same principle, namely, that everyone is the best judge\nof what concerns himself alone, and the most proper person to supply his\nprivate wants. The township and the county are therefore bound to take\ncare of their special interests: the State governs, but it does not\ninterfere with their administration. Exceptions to this rule may be met\nwith, but not a contrary principle.\n\nThe first consequence of this doctrine has been to cause all the\nmagistrates to be chosen either by or at least from amongst the\ncitizens. As the officers are everywhere elected or appointed for a\ncertain period, it has been impossible to establish the rules of a\ndependent series of authorities; there are almost as many independent\nfunctionaries as there are functions, and the executive power is\ndisseminated in a multitude of hands. Hence arose the indispensable\nnecessity of introducing the control of the courts of justice over the\nadministration, and the system of pecuniary penalties, by which the\nsecondary bodies and their representatives are constrained to obey the\nlaws. This system obtains from one end of the Union to the other. The\npower of punishing the misconduct of public officers, or of performing\nthe part of the executive in urgent cases, has not, however, been\nbestowed on the same judges in all the States. The Anglo-Americans\nderived the institution of justices of the peace from a common source;\nbut although it exists in all the States, it is not always turned to\nthe same use. The justices of the peace everywhere participate in the\nadministration of the townships and the counties, *h either as public\nofficers or as the judges of public misdemeanors, but in most of the\nStates the more important classes of public offences come under the\ncognizance of the ordinary tribunals.\n\n[Footnote h: In some of the Southern States the county courts are\ncharged with all the details of the administration. See the Statutes of\nthe State of Tennessee, arts. Judiciary, Taxes, etc.]\n\nThe election of public officers, or the inalienability of their\nfunctions, the absence of a gradation of powers, and the introduction\nof a judicial control over the secondary branches of the administration,\nare the universal characteristics of the American system from Maine to\nthe Floridas. In some States (and that of New York has advanced most\nin this direction) traces of a centralized administration begin to\nbe discernible. In the State of New York the officers of the central\ngovernment exercise, in certain cases, a sort of inspection or control\nover the secondary bodies. *i\n\n[Footnote i: For instance, the direction of public instruction centres\nin the hands of the Government. The legislature names the members of\nthe University, who are denominated Regents; the Governor\nand Lieutentant-Governor of the State are necessarily of the\nnumber.--Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455. The Regents of the University\nannually visit the colleges and academies, and make their report to\nthe legislature. Their superintendence is not inefficient, for several\nreasons: the colleges in order to become corporations stand in need of\na charter, which is only granted on the recommendation of the Regents;\nevery year funds are distributed by the State for the encouragement of\nlearning, and the Regents are the distributors of this money. See chap.\nxv. \"Instruction,\" Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 455.\n\nThe school-commissioners are obliged to send an annual report to the\nSuperintendent of the Republic.--Id. p. 488.\n\nA similar report is annually made to the same person on the number and\ncondition of the poor.--Id. p. 631.]\n\nAt other times they constitute a court of appeal for the decision of\naffairs. *j In the State of New York judicial penalties are less used\nthan in other parts as a means of administration, and the right of\nprosecuting the offences of public officers is vested in fewer hands. *k\nThe same tendency is faintly observable in some other States; *l but in\ngeneral the prominent feature of the administration in the United States\nis its excessive local independence.\n\n[Footnote j: If any one conceives himself to be wronged by the\nschool-commissioners (who are town-officers), he can appeal to the\nsuperintendent of the primary schools, whose decision is final.--Revised\nStatutes, vol. i. p. 487.\n\nProvisions similar to those above cited are to be met with from time to\ntime in the laws of the State of New York; but in general these attempts\nat centralization are weak and unproductive. The great authorities of\nthe State have the right of watching and controlling the subordinate\nagents, without that of rewarding or punishing them. The same individual\nis never empowered to give an order and to punish disobedience; he\nhas therefore the right of commanding, without the means of exacting\ncompliance. In 1830 the Superintendent of Schools complained in\nhis Annual Report addressed to the legislature that several\nschool-commissioners had neglected, notwithstanding his application,\nto furnish him with the accounts which were due. He added that if this\nomission continued he should be obliged to prosecute them, as the law\ndirects, before the proper tribunals.]\n\n[Footnote k: Thus the district-attorney is directed to recover all fines\nbelow the sum of fifty dollars, unless such a right has been specially\nawarded to another magistrate.--Revised Statutes, vol. i. p. 383.]\n\n[Footnote l: Several traces of centralization may be discovered in\nMassachusetts; for instance, the committees of the town-schools are\ndirected to make an annual report to the Secretary of State. See Laws of\nMassachusetts, vol. i. p. 367.]\n\nOf The State\n\nI have described the townships and the administration; it now remains\nfor me to speak of the State and the Government. This is ground I may\npass over rapidly, without fear of being misunderstood; for all I have\nto say is to be found in written forms of the various constitutions,\nwhich are easily to be procured. These constitutions rest upon a simple\nand rational theory; their forms have been adopted by all constitutional\nnations, and are become familiar to us. In this place, therefore, it\nis only necessary for me to give a short analysis; I shall endeavor\nafterwards to pass judgment upon what I now describe.\n\n\n\n\nChapter V: Necessity Of Examining The Condition Of The States--Part III\n\nLegislative Power Of The State\n\nDivision of the Legislative Body into two Houses--Senate--House of\nRepresentatives--Different functions of these two Bodies.\n\nThe legislative power of the State is vested in two assemblies, the\nfirst of which generally bears the name of the Senate. The Senate is\ncommonly a legislative body; but it sometimes becomes an executive\nand judicial one. It takes a part in the government in several ways,\naccording to the constitution of the different States; *m but it is in\nthe nomination of public functionaries that it most commonly assumes an\nexecutive power. It partakes of judicial power in the trial of certain\npolitical offences, and sometimes also in the decision of certain civil\ncases. *n The number of its members is always small. The other branch of\nthe legislature, which is usually called the House of Representatives,\nhas no share whatever in the administration, and only takes a part in\nthe judicial power inasmuch as it impeaches public functionaries before\nthe Senate. The members of the two Houses are nearly everywhere subject\nto the same conditions of election. They are chosen in the same manner,\nand by the same citizens. The only difference which exists between them\nis, that the term for which the Senate is chosen is in general longer\nthan that of the House of Representatives. The latter seldom remain in\noffice longer than a year; the former usually sit two or three years.\nBy granting to the senators the privilege of being chosen for several\nyears, and being renewed seriatim, the law takes care to preserve in the\nlegislative body a nucleus of men already accustomed to public business,\nand capable of exercising a salutary influence upon the junior members.\n\n[Footnote m: In Massachusetts the Senate is not invested with any\nadministrative functions.]\n\n[Footnote n: As in the State of New York.]\n\nThe Americans, plainly, did not desire, by this separation of the\nlegislative body into two branches, to make one house hereditary and the\nother elective; one aristocratic and the other democratic. It was not\ntheir object to create in the one a bulwark to power, whilst the\nother represented the interests and passions of the people. The only\nadvantages which result from the present constitution of the United\nStates are the division of the legislative power and the consequent\ncheck upon political assemblies; with the creation of a tribunal of\nappeal for the revision of the laws.\n\nTime and experience, however, have convinced the Americans that if these\nare its only advantages, the division of the legislative power is still\na principle of the greatest necessity. Pennsylvania was the only one of\nthe United States which at first attempted to establish a single\nHouse of Assembly, and Franklin himself was so far carried away by the\nnecessary consequences of the principle of the sovereignty of the people\nas to have concurred in the measure; but the Pennsylvanians were soon\nobliged to change the law, and to create two Houses. Thus the principle\nof the division of the legislative power was finally established, and\nits necessity may henceforward be regarded as a demonstrated truth. This\ntheory, which was nearly unknown to the republics of antiquity--which\nwas introduced into the world almost by accident, like so many other\ngreat truths--and misunderstood by several modern nations, is at length\nbecome an axiom in the political science of the present age.\n\n[See Benjamin Franklin]\n\nThe Executive Power Of The State\n\nOffice of Governor in an American State--The place he occupies in\nrelation to the Legislature--His rights and his duties--His dependence\non the people.\n\nThe executive power of the State may with truth be said to be\nrepresented by the Governor, although he enjoys but a portion of its\nrights. The supreme magistrate, under the title of Governor, is the\nofficial moderator and counsellor of the legislature. He is armed with\na veto or suspensive power, which allows him to stop, or at least to\nretard, its movements at pleasure. He lays the wants of the country\nbefore the legislative body, and points out the means which he thinks\nmay be usefully employed in providing for them; he is the natural\nexecutor of its decrees in all the undertakings which interest the\nnation at large. *o In the absence of the legislature, the Governor is\nbound to take all necessary steps to guard the State against violent\nshocks and unforeseen dangers. The whole military power of the State is\nat the disposal of the Governor. He is the commander of the militia, and\nhead of the armed force. When the authority, which is by general consent\nawarded to the laws, is disregarded, the Governor puts himself at\nthe head of the armed force of the State, to quell resistance, and to\nrestore order. Lastly, the Governor takes no share in the administration\nof townships and counties, except it be indirectly in the nomination of\nJustices of the Peace, which nomination he has not the power to cancel.\n*p The Governor is an elected magistrate, and is generally chosen\nfor one or two years only; so that he always continues to be strictly\ndependent upon the majority who returned him.\n\n[Footnote o: Practically speaking, it is not always the Governor who\nexecutes the plans of the Legislature; it often happens that the latter,\nin voting a measure, names special agents to superintend the execution\nof it.]\n\n[Footnote p: In some of the States the justices of the peace are not\nelected by the Governor.]\n\nPolitical Effects Of The System Of Local Administration In The United\nStates\n\nNecessary distinction between the general centralization of Government\nand the centralization of the local administration--Local administration\nnot centralized in the United States: great general centralization of\nthe Government--Some bad consequences resulting to the United States\nfrom the local administration--Administrative advantages attending\nthis order of things--The power which conducts the Government is less\nregular, less enlightened, less learned, but much greater than in\nEurope--Political advantages of this order of things--In the United\nStates the interests of the country are everywhere kept in view--Support\ngiven to the Government by the community--Provincial institutions\nmore necessary in proportion as the social condition becomes more\ndemocratic--Reason of this.\n\nCentralization is become a word of general and daily use, without any\nprecise meaning being attached to it. Nevertheless, there exist two\ndistinct kinds of centralization, which it is necessary to discriminate\nwith accuracy. Certain interests are common to all parts of a nation,\nsuch as the enactment of its general laws and the maintenance of its\nforeign relations. Other interests are peculiar to certain parts of the\nnation; such, for instance, as the business of different townships. When\nthe power which directs the general interests is centred in one place,\nor vested in the same persons, it constitutes a central government.\nIn like manner the power of directing partial or local interests,\nwhen brought together into one place, constitutes what may be termed a\ncentral administration.\n\nUpon some points these two kinds of centralization coalesce; but by\nclassifying the objects which fall more particularly within the province\nof each of them, they may easily be distinguished. It is evident that a\ncentral government acquires immense power when united to administrative\ncentralization. Thus combined, it accustoms men to set their own will\nhabitually and completely aside; to submit, not only for once, or upon\none point, but in every respect, and at all times. Not only, therefore,\ndoes this union of power subdue them compulsorily, but it affects them\nin the ordinary habits of life, and influences each individual, first\nseparately and then collectively.\n\nThese two kinds of centralization mutually assist and attract each\nother; but they must not be supposed to be inseparable. It is impossible\nto imagine a more completely central government than that which existed\nin France under Louis XIV.; when the same individual was the author and\nthe interpreter of the laws, and the representative of France at home\nand abroad, he was justified in asserting that the State was identified\nwith his person. Nevertheless, the administration was much less\ncentralized under Louis XIV. than it is at the present day.\n\nIn England the centralization of the government is carried to great\nperfection; the State has the compact vigor of a man, and by the\nsole act of its will it puts immense engines in motion, and wields or\ncollects the efforts of its authority. Indeed, I cannot conceive that\na nation can enjoy a secure or prosperous existence without a powerful\ncentralization of government. But I am of opinion that a central\nadministration enervates the nations in which it exists by incessantly\ndiminishing their public spirit. If such an administration succeeds\nin condensing at a given moment, on a given point, all the disposable\nresources of a people, it impairs at least the renewal of those\nresources. It may ensure a victory in the hour of strife, but it\ngradually relaxes the sinews of strength. It may contribute admirably\nto the transient greatness of a man, but it cannot ensure the durable\nprosperity of a nation.\n\nIf we pay proper attention, we shall find that whenever it is said\nthat a State cannot act because it has no central point, it is the\ncentralization of the government in which it is deficient. It is\nfrequently asserted, and we are prepared to assent to the proposition,\nthat the German empire was never able to bring all its powers into\naction. But the reason was, that the State was never able to enforce\nobedience to its general laws, because the several members of that great\nbody always claimed the right, or found the means, of refusing their\nco-operation to the representatives of the common authority, even in the\naffairs which concerned the mass of the people; in other words, because\nthere was no centralization of government. The same remark is applicable\nto the Middle Ages; the cause of all the confusion of feudal society\nwas that the control, not only of local but of general interests, was\ndivided amongst a thousand hands, and broken up in a thousand different\nways; the absence of a central government prevented the nations of\nEurope from advancing with energy in any straightforward course.\n\nWe have shown that in the United States no central administration and no\ndependent series of public functionaries exist. Local authority has been\ncarried to lengths which no European nation could endure without\ngreat inconvenience, and which has even produced some disadvantageous\nconsequences in America. But in the United States the centralization\nof the Government is complete; and it would be easy to prove that the\nnational power is more compact than it has ever been in the old nations\nof Europe. Not only is there but one legislative body in each State;\nnot only does there exist but one source of political authority;\nbut district assemblies and county courts have not in general been\nmultiplied, lest they should be tempted to exceed their administrative\nduties, and interfere with the Government. In America the legislature\nof each State is supreme; nothing can impede its authority; neither\nprivileges, nor local immunities, nor personal influence, nor even the\nempire of reason, since it represents that majority which claims to be\nthe sole organ of reason. Its own determination is, therefore, the only\nlimit to this action. In juxtaposition to it, and under its immediate\ncontrol, is the representative of the executive power, whose duty it\nis to constrain the refractory to submit by superior force. The only\nsymptom of weakness lies in certain details of the action of the\nGovernment. The American republics have no standing armies to intimidate\na discontented minority; but as no minority has as yet been reduced to\ndeclare open war, the necessity of an army has not been felt. *q The\nState usually employs the officers of the township or the county to\ndeal with the citizens. Thus, for instance, in New England, the assessor\nfixes the rate of taxes; the collector receives them; the town-treasurer\ntransmits the amount to the public treasury; and the disputes which may\narise are brought before the ordinary courts of justice. This method of\ncollecting taxes is slow as well as inconvenient, and it would prove a\nperpetual hindrance to a Government whose pecuniary demands were large.\nIt is desirable that, in whatever materially affects its existence, the\nGovernment should be served by officers of its own, appointed by itself,\nremovable at pleasure, and accustomed to rapid methods of proceeding.\nBut it will always be easy for the central government, organized as it\nis in America, to introduce new and more efficacious modes of action,\nproportioned to its wants. [Footnote q: [The Civil War of 1860-65\ncruelly belied this statement, and in the course of the struggle the\nNorth alone called two millions and a half of men to arms; but to the\nhonor of the United States it must be added that, with the cessation\nof the contest, this army disappeared as rapidly as it had been\nraised.--Translator's Note.]]\n\nThe absence of a central government will not, then, as has often been\nasserted, prove the destruction of the republics of the New World;\nfar from supposing that the American governments are not sufficiently\ncentralized, I shall prove hereafter that they are too much so. The\nlegislative bodies daily encroach upon the authority of the Government,\nand their tendency, like that of the French Convention, is to\nappropriate it entirely to themselves. Under these circumstances the\nsocial power is constantly changing hands, because it is subordinate to\nthe power of the people, which is too apt to forget the maxims of wisdom\nand of foresight in the consciousness of its strength: hence arises its\ndanger; and thus its vigor, and not its impotence, will probably be the\ncause of its ultimate destruction.\n\nThe system of local administration produces several different effects in\nAmerica. The Americans seem to me to have outstepped the limits of sound\npolicy in isolating the administration of the Government; for order,\neven in second-rate affairs, is a matter of national importance. *r As\nthe State has no administrative functionaries of its own, stationed on\ndifferent points of its territory, to whom it can give a common impulse,\nthe consequence is that it rarely attempts to issue any general police\nregulations. The want of these regulations is severely felt, and is\nfrequently observed by Europeans. The appearance of disorder which\nprevails on the surface leads him at first to imagine that society is\nin a state of anarchy; nor does he perceive his mistake till he has gone\ndeeper into the subject. Certain undertakings are of importance to the\nwhole State; but they cannot be put in execution, because there is no\nnational administration to direct them. Abandoned to the exertions of\nthe towns or counties, under the care of elected or temporary agents,\nthey lead to no result, or at least to no durable benefit.\n\n[Footnote r: The authority which represents the State ought not, I\nthink, to waive the right of inspecting the local administration, even\nwhen it does not interfere more actively. Suppose, for instance, that\nan agent of the Government was stationed at some appointed spot in the\ncountry, to prosecute the misdemeanors of the town and county officers,\nwould not a more uniform order be the result, without in any way\ncompromising the independence of the township? Nothing of the kind,\nhowever, exists in America: there is nothing above the county-courts,\nwhich have, as it were, only an incidental cognizance of the offences\nthey are meant to repress.]\n\nThe partisans of centralization in Europe are wont to maintain that the\nGovernment directs the affairs of each locality better than the citizens\ncould do it for themselves; this may be true when the central power is\nenlightened, and when the local districts are ignorant; when it is as\nalert as they are slow; when it is accustomed to act, and they to obey.\nIndeed, it is evident that this double tendency must augment with the\nincrease of centralization, and that the readiness of the one and the\nincapacity of the others must become more and more prominent. But I deny\nthat such is the case when the people is as enlightened, as awake to its\ninterests, and as accustomed to reflect on them, as the Americans are. I\nam persuaded, on the contrary, that in this case the collective strength\nof the citizens will always conduce more efficaciously to the public\nwelfare than the authority of the Government. It is difficult to point\nout with certainty the means of arousing a sleeping population, and of\ngiving it passions and knowledge which it does not possess; it is, I\nam well aware, an arduous task to persuade men to busy themselves about\ntheir own affairs; and it would frequently be easier to interest them\nin the punctilios of court etiquette than in the repairs of their common\ndwelling. But whenever a central administration affects to supersede\nthe persons most interested, I am inclined to suppose that it is either\nmisled or desirous to mislead. However enlightened and however skilful a\ncentral power may be, it cannot of itself embrace all the details of the\nexistence of a great nation. Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man.\nAnd when it attempts to create and set in motion so many complicated\nsprings, it must submit to a very imperfect result, or consume itself in\nbootless efforts.\n\nCentralization succeeds more easily, indeed, in subjecting the external\nactions of men to a certain uniformity, which at least commands our\nregard, independently of the objects to which it is applied, like those\ndevotees who worship the statue and forget the deity it represents.\nCentralization imparts without difficulty an admirable regularity to the\nroutine of business; provides for the details of the social police\nwith sagacity; represses the smallest disorder and the most petty\nmisdemeanors; maintains society in a status quo alike secure from\nimprovement and decline; and perpetuates a drowsy precision in the\nconduct of affairs, which is hailed by the heads of the administration\nas a sign of perfect order and public tranquillity: *s in short, it\nexcels more in prevention than in action. Its force deserts it when\nsociety is to be disturbed or accelerated in its course; and if once the\nco-operation of private citizens is necessary to the furtherance of\nits measures, the secret of its impotence is disclosed. Even whilst it\ninvokes their assistance, it is on the condition that they shall act\nexactly as much as the Government chooses, and exactly in the manner it\nappoints. They are to take charge of the details, without aspiring to\nguide the system; they are to work in a dark and subordinate sphere, and\nonly to judge the acts in which they have themselves cooperated by their\nresults. These, however, are not conditions on which the alliance of\nthe human will is to be obtained; its carriage must be free and its\nactions responsible, or (such is the constitution of man) the citizen\nhad rather remain a passive spectator than a dependent actor in schemes\nwith which he is unacquainted.\n\n[Footnote s: China appears to me to present the most perfect instance of\nthat species of well-being which a completely central administration may\nfurnish to the nations among which it exists. Travellers assure us that\nthe Chinese have peace without happiness, industry without improvement,\nstability without strength, and public order without public morality.\nThe condition of society is always tolerable, never excellent. I am\nconvinced that, when China is opened to European observation, it will\nbe found to contain the most perfect model of a central administration\nwhich exists in the universe.]\n\nIt is undeniable that the want of those uniform regulations which\ncontrol the conduct of every inhabitant of France is not unfrequently\nfelt in the United States. Gross instances of social indifference and\nneglect are to be met with, and from time to time disgraceful blemishes\nare seen in complete contrast with the surrounding civilization. Useful\nundertakings which cannot succeed without perpetual attention and\nrigorous exactitude are very frequently abandoned in the end; for in\nAmerica, as well as in other countries, the people is subject to sudden\nimpulses and momentary exertions. The European who is accustomed to find\na functionary always at hand to interfere with all he undertakes has\nsome difficulty in accustoming himself to the complex mechanism of the\nadministration of the townships. In general it may be affirmed that the\nlesser details of the police, which render life easy and comfortable,\nare neglected in America; but that the essential guarantees of man in\nsociety are as strong there as elsewhere. In America the power which\nconducts the Government is far less regular, less enlightened, and less\nlearned, but an hundredfold more authoritative than in Europe. In no\ncountry in the world do the citizens make such exertions for the common\nweal; and I am acquainted with no people which has established schools\nas numerous and as efficacious, places of public worship better suited\nto the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.\nUniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details,\n*t and the perfection of an ingenious administration, must not be sought\nfor in the United States; but it will be easy to find, on the other\nhand, the symptoms of a power which, if it is somewhat barbarous, is\nat least robust; and of an existence which is checkered with accidents\nindeed, but cheered at the same time by animation and effort.\n\n[Footnote t: A writer of talent, who, in the comparison which he has\ndrawn between the finances of France and those of the United States, has\nproved that ingenuity cannot always supply the place of a knowledge of\nfacts, very justly reproaches the Americans for the sort of confusion\nwhich exists in the accounts of the expenditure in the townships; and\nafter giving the model of a departmental budget in France, he adds:--\"We\nare indebted to centralization, that admirable invention of a great\nman, for the uniform order and method which prevail alike in all the\nmunicipal budgets, from the largest town to the humblest commune.\"\nWhatever may be my admiration of this result, when I see the communes\nof France, with their excellent system of accounts, plunged into\nthe grossest ignorance of their true interests, and abandoned to so\nincorrigible an apathy that they seem to vegetate rather than to live;\nwhen, on the other hand, I observe the activity, the information, and\nthe spirit of enterprise which keep society in perpetual labor, in those\nAmerican townships whose budgets are drawn up with small method and with\nstill less uniformity, I am struck by the spectacle; for to my mind the\nend of a good government is to ensure the welfare of a people, and not\nto establish order and regularity in the midst of its misery and its\ndistress. I am therefore led to suppose that the prosperity of the\nAmerican townships and the apparent confusion of their accounts, the\ndistress of the French communes and the perfection of their budget,\nmay be attributable to the same cause. At any rate I am suspicious of a\nbenefit which is united to so many evils, and I am not averse to an evil\nwhich is compensated by so many benefits.]\n\nGranting for an instant that the villages and counties of the United\nStates would be more usefully governed by a remote authority which\nthey had never seen than by functionaries taken from the midst of\nthem--admitting, for the sake of argument, that the country would be\nmore secure, and the resources of society better employed, if the whole\nadministration centred in a single arm--still the political advantages\nwhich the Americans derive from their system would induce me to prefer\nit to the contrary plan. It profits me but little, after all, that a\nvigilant authority should protect the tranquillity of my pleasures\nand constantly avert all dangers from my path, without my care or my\nconcern, if this same authority is the absolute mistress of my liberty\nand of my life, and if it so monopolizes all the energy of existence\nthat when it languishes everything languishes around it, that when it\nsleeps everything must sleep, that when it dies the State itself must\nperish.\n\nIn certain countries of Europe the natives consider themselves as a kind\nof settlers, indifferent to the fate of the spot upon which they live.\nThe greatest changes are effected without their concurrence and (unless\nchance may have apprised them of the event) without their knowledge; nay\nmore, the citizen is unconcerned as to the condition of his village, the\npolice of his street, the repairs of the church or of the parsonage; for\nhe looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself, and as the\nproperty of a powerful stranger whom he calls the Government. He has\nonly a life-interest in these possessions, and he entertains no notions\nof ownership or of improvement. This want of interest in his own\naffairs goes so far that, if his own safety or that of his children is\nendangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold his arms,\nand wait till the nation comes to his assistance. This same individual,\nwho has so completely sacrificed his own free will, has no natural\npropensity to obedience; he cowers, it is true, before the pettiest\nofficer; but he braves the law with the spirit of a conquered foe\nas soon as its superior force is removed: his oscillations between\nservitude and license are perpetual. When a nation has arrived at this\nstate it must either change its customs and its laws or perish: the\nsource of public virtue is dry, and, though it may contain subjects,\nthe race of citizens is extinct. Such communities are a natural prey to\nforeign conquests, and if they do not disappear from the scene of life,\nit is because they are surrounded by other nations similar or inferior\nto themselves: it is because the instinctive feeling of their country's\nclaims still exists in their hearts; and because an involuntary pride in\nthe name it bears, or a vague reminiscence of its bygone fame, suffices\nto give them the impulse of self-preservation.\n\nNor can the prodigious exertions made by tribes in the defence of a\ncountry to which they did not belong be adduced in favor of such a\nsystem; for it will be found that in these cases their main incitement\nwas religion. The permanence, the glory, or the prosperity of the nation\nwere become parts of their faith, and in defending the country they\ninhabited they defended that Holy City of which they were all citizens.\nThe Turkish tribes have never taken an active share in the conduct of\nthe affairs of society, but they accomplished stupendous enterprises as\nlong as the victories of the Sultan were the triumphs of the Mohammedan\nfaith. In the present age they are in rapid decay, because their\nreligion is departing, and despotism only remains. Montesquieu, who\nattributed to absolute power an authority peculiar to itself, did it,\nas I conceive, an undeserved honor; for despotism, taken by itself,\ncan produce no durable results. On close inspection we shall find\nthat religion, and not fear, has ever been the cause of the long-lived\nprosperity of an absolute government. Whatever exertions may be made, no\ntrue power can be founded among men which does not depend upon the free\nunion of their inclinations; and patriotism and religion are the only\ntwo motives in the world which can permanently direct the whole of a\nbody politic to one end.\n\nLaws cannot succeed in rekindling the ardor of an extinguished faith,\nbut men may be interested in the fate of their country by the laws. By\nthis influence the vague impulse of patriotism, which never abandons the\nhuman heart, may be directed and revived; and if it be connected with\nthe thoughts, the passions, and the daily habits of life, it may be\nconsolidated into a durable and rational sentiment.\n\nLet it not be said that the time for the experiment is already past; for\nthe old age of nations is not like the old age of men, and every fresh\ngeneration is a new people ready for the care of the legislator.\n\nIt is not the administrative but the political effects of the local\nsystem that I most admire in America. In the United States the interests\nof the country are everywhere kept in view; they are an object of\nsolicitude to the people of the whole Union, and every citizen is as\nwarmly attached to them as if they were his own. He takes pride in the\nglory of his nation; he boasts of its success, to which he conceives\nhimself to have contributed, and he rejoices in the general prosperity\nby which he profits. The feeling he entertains towards the State is\nanalogous to that which unites him to his family, and it is by a kind of\negotism that he interests himself in the welfare of his country.\n\nThe European generally submits to a public officer because he represents\na superior force; but to an American he represents a right. In America\nit may be said that no one renders obedience to man, but to justice\nand to law. If the opinion which the citizen entertains of himself is\nexaggerated, it is at least salutary; he unhesitatingly confides in his\nown powers, which appear to him to be all-sufficient. When a private\nindividual meditates an undertaking, however directly connected it\nmay be with the welfare of society, he never thinks of soliciting the\nco-operation of the Government, but he publishes his plan, offers to\nexecute it himself, courts the assistance of other individuals, and\nstruggles manfully against all obstacles. Undoubtedly he is often less\nsuccessful than the State might have been in his position; but in the\nend the sum of these private undertakings far exceeds all that the\nGovernment could have done.\n\nAs the administrative authority is within the reach of the citizens,\nwhom it in some degree represents, it excites neither their jealousy nor\ntheir hatred; as its resources are limited, every one feels that he must\nnot rely solely on its assistance. Thus, when the administration thinks\nfit to interfere, it is not abandoned to itself as in Europe; the duties\nof the private citizens are not supposed to have lapsed because the\nState assists in their fulfilment, but every one is ready, on the\ncontrary, to guide and to support it. This action of individual\nexertions, joined to that of the public authorities, frequently performs\nwhat the most energetic central administration would be unable to\nexecute. It would be easy to adduce several facts in proof of what I\nadvance, but I had rather give only one, with which I am more thoroughly\nacquainted. *u In America the means which the authorities have at their\ndisposal for the discovery of crimes and the arrest of criminals are\nfew. The State police does not exist, and passports are unknown. The\ncriminal police of the United States cannot be compared to that of\nFrance; the magistrates and public prosecutors are not numerous, and the\nexaminations of prisoners are rapid and oral. Nevertheless in no country\ndoes crime more rarely elude punishment. The reason is, that every one\nconceives himself to be interested in furnishing evidence of the act\ncommitted, and in stopping the delinquent. During my stay in the United\nStates I witnessed the spontaneous formation of committees for the\npursuit and prosecution of a man who had committed a great crime in\na certain county. In Europe a criminal is an unhappy being who is\nstruggling for his life against the ministers of justice, whilst the\npopulation is merely a spectator of the conflict; in America he is\nlooked upon as an enemy of the human race, and the whole of mankind is\nagainst him.\n\n[Footnote u: See Appendix, I.]\n\nI believe that provincial institutions are useful to all nations, but\nnowhere do they appear to me to be more indispensable than amongst a\ndemocratic people. In an aristocracy order can always be maintained in\nthe midst of liberty, and as the rulers have a great deal to lose order\nis to them a first-rate consideration. In like manner an aristocracy\nprotects the people from the excesses of despotism, because it always\npossesses an organized power ready to resist a despot. But a democracy\nwithout provincial institutions has no security against these evils. How\ncan a populace, unaccustomed to freedom in small concerns, learn to\nuse it temperately in great affairs? What resistance can be offered to\ntyranny in a country where every private individual is impotent, and\nwhere the citizens are united by no common tie? Those who dread the\nlicense of the mob, and those who fear the rule of absolute power, ought\nalike to desire the progressive growth of provincial liberties.\n\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that democratic nations are most\nexposed to fall beneath the yoke of a central administration, for\nseveral reasons, amongst which is the following. The constant tendency\nof these nations is to concentrate all the strength of the Government\nin the hands of the only power which directly represents the people,\nbecause beyond the people nothing is to be perceived but a mass of equal\nindividuals confounded together. But when the same power is already\nin possession of all the attributes of the Government, it can scarcely\nrefrain from penetrating into the details of the administration, and an\nopportunity of doing so is sure to present itself in the end, as was\nthe case in France. In the French Revolution there were two impulses\nin opposite directions, which must never be confounded--the one was\nfavorable to liberty, the other to despotism. Under the ancient monarchy\nthe King was the sole author of the laws, and below the power of the\nsovereign certain vestiges of provincial institutions, half destroyed,\nwere still distinguishable. These provincial institutions were\nincoherent, ill compacted, and frequently absurd; in the hands of\nthe aristocracy they had sometimes been converted into instruments of\noppression. The Revolution declared itself the enemy of royalty and of\nprovincial institutions at the same time; it confounded all that\nhad preceded it--despotic power and the checks to its abuses--in\nindiscriminate hatred, and its tendency was at once to overthrow and\nto centralize. This double character of the French Revolution is a fact\nwhich has been adroitly handled by the friends of absolute power. Can\nthey be accused of laboring in the cause of despotism when they are\ndefending that central administration which was one of the great\ninnovations of the Revolution? *v In this manner popularity may be\nconciliated with hostility to the rights of the people, and the secret\nslave of tyranny may be the professed admirer of freedom.\n\n[Footnote v: See Appendix K.]\n\nI have visited the two nations in which the system of provincial liberty\nhas been most perfectly established, and I have listened to the opinions\nof different parties in those countries. In America I met with men who\nsecretly aspired to destroy the democratic institutions of the Union; in\nEngland I found others who attacked the aristocracy openly, but I\nknow of no one who does not regard provincial independence as a great\nbenefit. In both countries I have heard a thousand different causes\nassigned for the evils of the State, but the local system was never\nmentioned amongst them. I have heard citizens attribute the power and\nprosperity of their country to a multitude of reasons, but they all\nplaced the advantages of local institutions in the foremost rank. Am\nI to suppose that when men who are naturally so divided on religious\nopinions and on political theories agree on one point (and that one\nof which they have daily experience), they are all in error? The only\nnations which deny the utility of provincial liberties are those which\nhave fewest of them; in other words, those who are unacquainted with the\ninstitution are the only persons who pass a censure upon it.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VI: Judicial Power In The United States\n\nChapter Summary\n\nThe Anglo-Americans have retained the characteristics of judicial power\nwhich are common to all nations--They have, however, made it a powerful\npolitical organ--How--In what the judicial system of the Anglo-Americans\ndiffers from that of all other nations--Why the American judges have the\nright of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional--How they use this\nright--Precautions taken by the legislator to prevent its abuse.\n\nJudicial Power In The United States And Its Influence On Political\nSociety.\n\nI have thought it essential to devote a separate chapter to the judicial\nauthorities of the United States, lest their great political importance\nshould be lessened in the reader's eyes by a merely incidental mention\nof them. Confederations have existed in other countries beside America,\nand republics have not been established upon the shores of the New\nWorld alone; the representative system of government has been adopted\nin several States of Europe, but I am not aware that any nation of\nthe globe has hitherto organized a judicial power on the principle now\nadopted by the Americans. The judicial organization of the United States\nis the institution which a stranger has the greatest difficulty\nin understanding. He hears the authority of a judge invoked in the\npolitical occurrences of every day, and he naturally concludes that\nin the United States the judges are important political functionaries;\nnevertheless, when he examines the nature of the tribunals, they offer\nnothing which is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those\nbodies, and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs\nof chance, but by a chance which recurs every day.\n\nWhen the Parliament of Paris remonstrated, or refused to enregister an\nedict, or when it summoned a functionary accused of malversation to its\nbar, its political influence as a judicial body was clearly visible; but\nnothing of the kind is to be seen in the United States. The Americans\nhave retained all the ordinary characteristics of judicial authority,\nand have carefully restricted its action to the ordinary circle of its\nfunctions.\n\nThe first characteristic of judicial power in all nations is the duty\nof arbitration. But rights must be contested in order to warrant the\ninterference of a tribunal; and an action must be brought to obtain the\ndecision of a judge. As long, therefore, as the law is uncontested, the\njudicial authority is not called upon to discuss it, and it may exist\nwithout being perceived. When a judge in a given case attacks a law\nrelating to that case, he extends the circle of his customary duties,\nwithout however stepping beyond it; since he is in some measure obliged\nto decide upon the law in order to decide the case. But if he pronounces\nupon a law without resting upon a case, he clearly steps beyond his\nsphere, and invades that of the legislative authority.\n\nThe second characteristic of judicial power is that it pronounces on\nspecial cases, and not upon general principles. If a judge in deciding\na particular point destroys a general principle, by passing a judgment\nwhich tends to reject all the inferences from that principle, and\nconsequently to annul it, he remains within the ordinary limits of his\nfunctions. But if he directly attacks a general principle without having\na particular case in view, he leaves the circle in which all nations\nhave agreed to confine his authority, he assumes a more important, and\nperhaps a more useful, influence than that of the magistrate, but he\nceases to be a representative of the judicial power.\n\n\nThe third characteristic of the judicial power is its inability to act\nunless it is appealed to, or until it has taken cognizance of an\naffair. This characteristic is less general than the other two; but,\nnotwithstanding the exceptions, I think it may be regarded as essential.\nThe judicial power is by its nature devoid of action; it must be put in\nmotion in order to produce a result. When it is called upon to repress a\ncrime, it punishes the criminal; when a wrong is to be redressed, it is\nready to redress it; when an act requires interpretation, it is prepared\nto interpret it; but it does not pursue criminals, hunt out wrongs,\nor examine into evidence of its own accord. A judicial functionary who\nshould open proceedings, and usurp the censorship of the laws, would in\nsome measure do violence to the passive nature of his authority.\n\nThe Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics\nof the judicial power; an American judge can only pronounce a decision\nwhen litigation has arisen, he is only conversant with special cases,\nand he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the\ncourt. His position is therefore perfectly similar to that of the\nmagistrate of other nations; and he is nevertheless invested with\nimmense political power. If the sphere of his authority and his means of\naction are the same as those of other judges, it may be asked whence he\nderives a power which they do not possess. The cause of this difference\nlies in the simple fact that the Americans have acknowledged the right\nof the judges to found their decisions on the constitution rather than\non the laws. In other words, they have left them at liberty not to apply\nsuch laws as may appear to them to be unconstitutional.\n\nI am aware that a similar right has been claimed--but claimed in\nvain--by courts of justice in other countries; but in America it is\nrecognized by all authorities; and not a party, nor so much as an\nindividual, is found to contest it. This fact can only be explained by\nthe principles of the American constitution. In France the constitution\nis (or at least is supposed to be) immutable; and the received theory is\nthat no power has the right of changing any part of it. In England the\nParliament has an acknowledged right to modify the constitution; as,\ntherefore, the constitution may undergo perpetual changes, it does\nnot in reality exist; the Parliament is at once a legislative and a\nconstituent assembly. The political theories of America are more simple\nand more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be\nimmutable as in France, nor is it susceptible of modification by the\nordinary powers of society as in England. It constitutes a detached\nwhole, which, as it represents the determination of the whole people, is\nno less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but\nwhich may be altered by the will of the people in predetermined\ncases, according to established rules. In America the constitution\nmay therefore vary, but as long as it exists it is the origin of all\nauthority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force. *a\n\n[Footnote a: [The fifth article of the original Constitution of the\nUnited States provides the mode in which amendments of the Constitution\nmay be made. Amendments must be proposed by two-thirds of both Houses\nof Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the\nseveral States. Fifteen amendments of the Constitution have been made\nat different times since 1789, the most important of which are the\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, framed and ratified after the\nCivil War. The original Constitution of the United States, followed\nby these fifteen amendments, is printed at the end of this edition.\n--Translator's Note, 1874.]]\n\nIt is easy to perceive in what manner these differences must act\nupon the position and the rights of the judicial bodies in the three\ncountries I have cited. If in France the tribunals were authorized\nto disobey the laws on the ground of their being opposed to the\nconstitution, the supreme power would in fact be placed in their hands,\nsince they alone would have the right of interpreting a constitution,\nthe clauses of which can be modified by no authority. They would\ntherefore take the place of the nation, and exercise as absolute a sway\nover society as the inherent weakness of judicial power would allow them\nto do. Undoubtedly, as the French judges are incompetent to declare a\nlaw to be unconstitutional, the power of changing the constitution is\nindirectly given to the legislative body, since no legal barrier would\noppose the alterations which it might prescribe. But it is better to\ngrant the power of changing the constitution of the people to men who\nrepresent (however imperfectly) the will of the people, than to men who\nrepresent no one but themselves.\n\nIt would be still more unreasonable to invest the English judges with\nthe right of resisting the decisions of the legislative body, since\nthe Parliament which makes the laws also makes the constitution; and\nconsequently a law emanating from the three powers of the State can in\nno case be unconstitutional. But neither of these remarks is applicable\nto America.\n\nIn the United States the constitution governs the legislator as much as\nthe private citizen; as it is the first of laws it cannot be modified\nby a law, and it is therefore just that the tribunals should obey the\nconstitution in preference to any law. This condition is essential to\nthe power of the judicature, for to select that legal obligation\nby which he is most strictly bound is the natural right of every\nmagistrate.\n\nIn France the constitution is also the first of laws, and the judges\nhave the same right to take it as the ground of their decisions, but\nwere they to exercise this right they must perforce encroach on rights\nmore sacred than their own, namely, on those of society, in whose name\nthey are acting. In this case the State-motive clearly prevails over the\nmotives of an individual. In America, where the nation can always reduce\nits magistrates to obedience by changing its constitution, no danger of\nthis kind is to be feared. Upon this point, therefore, the political and\nthe logical reasons agree, and the people as well as the judges preserve\ntheir privileges.\n\nWhenever a law which the judge holds to be unconstitutional is argued\nin a tribunal of the United States he may refuse to admit it as a rule;\nthis power is the only one which is peculiar to the American magistrate,\nbut it gives rise to immense political influence. Few laws can escape\nthe searching analysis of the judicial power for any length of time,\nfor there are few which are not prejudicial to some private interest or\nother, and none which may not be brought before a court of justice by\nthe choice of parties, or by the necessity of the case. But from the\ntime that a judge has refused to apply any given law in a case, that law\nloses a portion of its moral cogency. The persons to whose interests\nit is prejudicial learn that means exist of evading its authority, and\nsimilar suits are multiplied, until it becomes powerless. One of\ntwo alternatives must then be resorted to: the people must alter the\nconstitution, or the legislature must repeal the law. The political\npower which the Americans have intrusted to their courts of justice\nis therefore immense, but the evils of this power are considerably\ndiminished by the obligation which has been imposed of attacking\nthe laws through the courts of justice alone. If the judge had been\nempowered to contest the laws on the ground of theoretical generalities,\nif he had been enabled to open an attack or to pass a censure on the\nlegislator, he would have played a prominent part in the political\nsphere; and as the champion or the antagonist of a party, he would have\narrayed the hostile passions of the nation in the conflict. But when\na judge contests a law applied to some particular case in an obscure\nproceeding, the importance of his attack is concealed from the public\ngaze, his decision bears upon the interest of an individual, and if\nthe law is slighted it is only collaterally. Moreover, although it is\ncensured, it is not abolished; its moral force may be diminished, but\nits cogency is by no means suspended, and its final destruction can only\nbe accomplished by the reiterated attacks of judicial functionaries. It\nwill readily be understood that by connecting the censorship of the\nlaws with the private interests of members of the community, and by\nintimately uniting the prosecution of the law with the prosecution of\nan individual, legislation is protected from wanton assailants, and from\nthe daily aggressions of party spirit. The errors of the legislator are\nexposed whenever their evil consequences are most felt, and it is\nalways a positive and appreciable fact which serves as the basis of a\nprosecution.\n\nI am inclined to believe this practice of the American courts to be at\nonce the most favorable to liberty as well as to public order. If the\njudge could only attack the legislator openly and directly, he would\nsometimes be afraid to oppose any resistance to his will; and at other\nmoments party spirit might encourage him to brave it at every turn.\nThe laws would consequently be attacked when the power from which they\nemanate is weak, and obeyed when it is strong. That is to say, when it\nwould be useful to respect them they would be contested, and when it\nwould be easy to convert them into an instrument of oppression they\nwould be respected. But the American judge is brought into the political\narena independently of his own will. He only judges the law because he\nis obliged to judge a case. The political question which he is called\nupon to resolve is connected with the interest of the suitors, and he\ncannot refuse to decide it without abdicating the duties of his post.\nHe performs his functions as a citizen by fulfilling the precise duties\nwhich belong to his profession as a magistrate. It is true that upon\nthis system the judicial censorship which is exercised by the courts of\njustice over the legislation cannot extend to all laws indiscriminately,\ninasmuch as some of them can never give rise to that exact species\nof contestation which is termed a lawsuit; and even when such a\ncontestation is possible, it may happen that no one cares to bring\nit before a court of justice. The Americans have often felt this\ndisadvantage, but they have left the remedy incomplete, lest they should\ngive it an efficacy which might in some cases prove dangerous. Within\nthese limits the power vested in the American courts of justice of\npronouncing a statute to be unconstitutional forms one of the most\npowerful barriers which has ever been devised against the tyranny of\npolitical assemblies.\n\nOther Powers Granted To American Judges\n\nThe United States all the citizens have the right of indicting\npublic functionaries before the ordinary tribunals--How they use this\nright--Art. 75 of the French Constitution of the An VIII--The Americans\nand the English cannot understand the purport of this clause.\n\nIt is perfectly natural that in a free country like America all the\ncitizens should have the right of indicting public functionaries before\nthe ordinary tribunals, and that all the judges should have the power of\npunishing public offences. The right granted to the courts of justice of\njudging the agents of the executive government, when they have violated\nthe laws, is so natural a one that it cannot be looked upon as an\nextraordinary privilege. Nor do the springs of government appear to\nme to be weakened in the United States by the custom which renders all\npublic officers responsible to the judges of the land. The Americans\nseem, on the contrary, to have increased by this means that respect\nwhich is due to the authorities, and at the same time to have rendered\nthose who are in power more scrupulous of offending public opinion. I\nwas struck by the small number of political trials which occur in\nthe United States, but I had no difficulty in accounting for this\ncircumstance. A lawsuit, of whatever nature it may be, is always a\ndifficult and expensive undertaking. It is easy to attack a public man\nin a journal, but the motives which can warrant an action at law must be\nserious. A solid ground of complaint must therefore exist to induce\nan individual to prosecute a public officer, and public officers are\ncareful not to furnish these grounds of complaint when they are afraid\nof being prosecuted.\n\nThis does not depend upon the republican form of American institutions,\nfor the same facts present themselves in England. These two nations\ndo not regard the impeachment of the principal officers of State as a\nsufficient guarantee of their independence. But they hold that the\nright of minor prosecutions, which are within the reach of the whole\ncommunity, is a better pledge of freedom than those great judicial\nactions which are rarely employed until it is too late.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when it was very difficult to overtake offenders,\nthe judges inflicted the most dreadful tortures on the few who were\narrested, which by no means diminished the number of crimes. It has\nsince been discovered that when justice is more certain and more mild,\nit is at the same time more efficacious. The English and the Americans\nhold that tyranny and oppression are to be treated like any other crime,\nby lessening the penalty and facilitating conviction.\n\nIn the year VIII of the French Republic a constitution was drawn up in\nwhich the following clause was introduced: \"Art. 75. All the agents of\nthe government below the rank of ministers can only be prosecuted for\noffences relating to their several functions by virtue of a decree of\nthe Conseil d'Etat; in which the case the prosecution takes place before\nthe ordinary tribunals.\" This clause survived the \"Constitution de l'An\nVIII,\" and it is still maintained in spite of the just complaints of\nthe nation. I have always found the utmost difficulty in explaining its\nmeaning to Englishmen or Americans. They were at once led to conclude\nthat the Conseil d'Etat in France was a great tribunal, established in\nthe centre of the kingdom, which exercised a preliminary and somewhat\ntyrannical jurisdiction in all political causes. But when I told them\nthat the Conseil d'Etat was not a judicial body, in the common sense of\nthe term, but an administrative council composed of men dependent on\nthe Crown, so that the king, after having ordered one of his servants,\ncalled a Prefect, to commit an injustice, has the power of commanding\nanother of his servants, called a Councillor of State, to prevent the\nformer from being punished; when I demonstrated to them that the citizen\nwho has been injured by the order of the sovereign is obliged to solicit\nfrom the sovereign permission to obtain redress, they refused to credit\nso flagrant an abuse, and were tempted to accuse me of falsehood or\nof ignorance. It frequently happened before the Revolution that a\nParliament issued a warrant against a public officer who had committed\nan offence, and sometimes the proceedings were stopped by the authority\nof the Crown, which enforced compliance with its absolute and despotic\nwill. It is painful to perceive how much lower we are sunk than our\nforefathers, since we allow things to pass under the color of justice\nand the sanction of the law which violence alone could impose upon them.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VII: Political Jurisdiction In The United States\n\nChapter Summary\n\nDefinition of political jurisdiction--What is understood by political\njurisdiction in France, in England, and in the United States--In America\nthe political judge can only pass sentence on public officers--He\nmore frequently passes a sentence of removal from office than a\npenalty--Political jurisdiction as it exists in the United States\nis, notwithstanding its mildness, and perhaps in consequence of that\nmildness, a most powerful instrument in the hands of the majority.\n\nPolitical Jurisdiction In The United States\n\nI understand, by political jurisdiction, that temporary right of\npronouncing a legal decision with which a political body may be\ninvested.\n\nIn absolute governments no utility can accrue from the introduction of\nextraordinary forms of procedure; the prince in whose name an offender\nis prosecuted is as much the sovereign of the courts of justice as of\neverything else, and the idea which is entertained of his power is of\nitself a sufficient security. The only thing he has to fear is, that\nthe external formalities of justice should be neglected, and that his\nauthority should be dishonored from a wish to render it more absolute.\nBut in most free countries, in which the majority can never exercise the\nsame influence upon the tribunals as an absolute monarch, the judicial\npower has occasionally been vested for a time in the representatives\nof the nation. It has been thought better to introduce a temporary\nconfusion between the functions of the different authorities than to\nviolate the necessary principle of the unity of government.\n\nEngland, France, and the United States have established this political\njurisdiction by law; and it is curious to examine the different\nadaptations which these three great nations have made of the principle.\nIn England and in France the House of Lords and the Chambre des Paris *a\nconstitute the highest criminal court of their respective nations, and\nalthough they do not habitually try all political offences, they are\ncompetent to try them all. Another political body enjoys the right of\nimpeachment before the House of Lords: the only difference which exists\nbetween the two countries in this respect is, that in England the\nCommons may impeach whomsoever they please before the Lords, whilst in\nFrance the Deputies can only employ this mode of prosecution against the\nministers of the Crown.\n\n[Footnote a: [As it existed under the constitutional monarchy down to\n1848.]]\n\nIn both countries the Upper House may make use of all the existing penal\nlaws of the nation to punish the delinquents.\n\nIn the United States, as well as in Europe, one branch of the\nlegislature is authorized to impeach and another to judge: the House\nof Representatives arraigns the offender, and the Senate awards his\nsentence. But the Senate can only try such persons as are brought before\nit by the House of Representatives, and those persons must belong to the\nclass of public functionaries. Thus the jurisdiction of the Senate is\nless extensive than that of the Peers of France, whilst the right of\nimpeachment by the Representatives is more general than that of the\nDeputies. But the great difference which exists between Europe and\nAmerica is, that in Europe political tribunals are empowered to inflict\nall the dispositions of the penal code, while in America, when they\nhave deprived the offender of his official rank, and have declared\nhim incapable of filling any political office for the future, their\njurisdiction terminates and that of the ordinary tribunals begins.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that the President of the United States has\ncommitted the crime of high treason; the House of Representatives\nimpeaches him, and the Senate degrades him; he must then be tried by\na jury, which alone can deprive him of his liberty or his life. This\naccurately illustrates the subject we are treating. The political\njurisdiction which is established by the laws of Europe is intended to\ntry great offenders, whatever may be their birth, their rank, or their\npowers in the State; and to this end all the privileges of the courts\nof justice are temporarily extended to a great political assembly. The\nlegislator is then transformed into the magistrate; he is called upon\nto admit, to distinguish, and to punish the offence; and as he exercises\nall the authority of a judge, the law restricts him to the observance\nof all the duties of that high office, and of all the formalities of\njustice. When a public functionary is impeached before an English or a\nFrench political tribunal, and is found guilty, the sentence deprives\nhim ipso facto of his functions, and it may pronounce him to be\nincapable of resuming them or any others for the future. But in this\ncase the political interdict is a consequence of the sentence, and not\nthe sentence itself. In Europe the sentence of a political tribunal is\nto be regarded as a judicial verdict rather than as an administrative\nmeasure. In the United States the contrary takes place; and although the\ndecision of the Senate is judicial in its form, since the Senators\nare obliged to comply with the practices and formalities of a court of\njustice; although it is judicial in respect to the motives on which it\nis founded, since the Senate is in general obliged to take an offence at\ncommon law as the basis of its sentence; nevertheless the object of the\nproceeding is purely administrative. If it had been the intention of\nthe American legislator to invest a political body with great judicial\nauthority, its action would not have been limited to the circle of\npublic functionaries, since the most dangerous enemies of the State may\nbe in the possession of no functions at all; and this is especially true\nin republics, where party influence is the first of authorities, and\nwhere the strength of many a reader is increased by his exercising no\nlegal power.\n\nIf it had been the intention of the American legislator to give\nsociety the means of repressing State offences by exemplary punishment,\naccording to the practice of ordinary justice, the resources of the\npenal code would all have been placed at the disposal of the political\ntribunals. But the weapon with which they are intrusted is an imperfect\none, and it can never reach the most dangerous offenders, since men who\naim at the entire subversion of the laws are not likely to murmur at a\npolitical interdict.\n\nThe main object of the political jurisdiction which obtains in the\nUnited States is, therefore, to deprive the ill-disposed citizen of\nan authority which he has used amiss, and to prevent him from ever\nacquiring it again. This is evidently an administrative measure\nsanctioned by the formalities of a judicial decision. In this matter\nthe Americans have created a mixed system; they have surrounded the act\nwhich removes a public functionary with the securities of a political\ntrial; and they have deprived all political condemnations of their\nseverest penalties. Every link of the system may easily be traced from\nthis point; we at once perceive why the American constitutions subject\nall the civil functionaries to the jurisdiction of the Senate, whilst\nthe military, whose crimes are nevertheless more formidable, are\nexempted from that tribunal. In the civil service none of the American\nfunctionaries can be said to be removable; the places which some of\nthem occupy are inalienable, and the others are chosen for a term which\ncannot be shortened. It is therefore necessary to try them all in order\nto deprive them of their authority. But military officers are\ndependent on the chief magistrate of the State, who is himself a civil\nfunctionary, and the decision which condemns him is a blow upon them\nall.\n\nIf we now compare the American and the European systems, we shall meet\nwith differences no less striking in the different effects which each of\nthem produces or may produce. In France and in England the jurisdiction\nof political bodies is looked upon as an extraordinary resource, which\nis only to be employed in order to rescue society from unwonted dangers.\nIt is not to be denied that these tribunals, as they are constituted in\nEurope, are apt to violate the conservative principle of the balance of\npower in the State, and to threaten incessantly the lives and liberties\nof the subject. The same political jurisdiction in the United States is\nonly indirectly hostile to the balance of power; it cannot menace the\nlives of the citizens, and it does not hover, as in Europe, over the\nheads of the community, since those only who have submitted to its\nauthority on accepting office are exposed to the severity of its\ninvestigations. It is at the same time less formidable and less\nefficacious; indeed, it has not been considered by the legislators of\nthe United States as a remedy for the more violent evils of society, but\nas an ordinary means of conducting the government. In this respect it\nprobably exercises more real influence on the social body in America\nthan in Europe. We must not be misled by the apparent mildness of the\nAmerican legislation in all that relates to political jurisdiction. It\nis to be observed, in the first place, that in the United States the\ntribunal which passes sentence is composed of the same elements,\nand subject to the same influences, as the body which impeaches the\noffender, and that this uniformity gives an almost irresistible impulse\nto the vindictive passions of parties. If political judges in the United\nStates cannot inflict such heavy penalties as those of Europe, there is\nthe less chance of their acquitting a prisoner; and the conviction,\nif it is less formidable, is more certain. The principal object of the\npolitical tribunals of Europe is to punish the offender; the purpose\nof those in America is to deprive him of his authority. A political\ncondemnation in the United States may, therefore, be looked upon as a\npreventive measure; and there is no reason for restricting the judges to\nthe exact definitions of criminal law. Nothing can be more alarming than\nthe excessive latitude with which political offences are described in\nthe laws of America. Article II., Section 4, of the Constitution of the\nUnited States runs thus:--\"The President, Vice-President, and all\ncivil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on\nimpeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high\ncrimes and misdemeanors.\" Many of the Constitutions of the States\nare even less explicit. \"Public officers,\" says the Constitution\nof Massachusetts, *b \"shall be impeached for misconduct or\nmaladministration;\" the Constitution of Virginia declares that all\nthe civil officers who shall have offended against the State, by\nmaladministration, corruption, or other high crimes, may be impeached by\nthe House of Delegates; in some constitutions no offences are\nspecified, in order to subject the public functionaries to an unlimited\nresponsibility. *c But I will venture to affirm that it is precisely\ntheir mildness which renders the American laws most formidable in this\nrespect. We have shown that in Europe the removal of a functionary and\nhis political interdiction are the consequences of the penalty he is\nto undergo, and that in America they constitute the penalty itself.\nThe consequence is that in Europe political tribunals are invested with\nrights which they are afraid to use, and that the fear of punishing too\nmuch hinders them from punishing at all. But in America no one hesitates\nto inflict a penalty from which humanity does not recoil. To condemn a\npolitical opponent to death, in order to deprive him of his power, is\nto commit what all the world would execrate as a horrible assassination;\nbut to declare that opponent unworthy to exercise that authority, to\ndeprive him of it, and to leave him uninjured in life and limb, may be\njudged to be the fair issue of the struggle. But this sentence, which it\nis so easy to pronounce, is not the less fatally severe to the majority\nof those upon whom it is inflicted. Great criminals may undoubtedly\nbrave its intangible rigor, but ordinary offenders will dread it as a\ncondemnation which destroys their position in the world, casts a blight\nupon their honor, and condemns them to a shameful inactivity worse than\ndeath. The influence exercised in the United States upon the progress\nof society by the jurisdiction of political bodies may not appear to be\nformidable, but it is only the more immense. It does not directly coerce\nthe subject, but it renders the majority more absolute over those in\npower; it does not confer an unbounded authority on the legislator which\ncan be exerted at some momentous crisis, but it establishes a temperate\nand regular influence, which is at all times available. If the power is\ndecreased, it can, on the other hand, be more conveniently employed and\nmore easily abused. By preventing political tribunals from inflicting\njudicial punishments the Americans seem to have eluded the worst\nconsequences of legislative tyranny, rather than tyranny itself; and\nI am not sure that political jurisdiction, as it is constituted in the\nUnited States, is not the most formidable weapon which has ever been\nplaced in the rude grasp of a popular majority. When the American\nrepublics begin to degenerate it will be easy to verify the truth\nof this observation, by remarking whether the number of political\nimpeachments augments.*d\n\n[Footnote b: Chap. I. sect. ii. Section 8.]\n\n[Footnote c: See the constitutions of Illinois, Maine, Connecticut, and\nGeorgia.]\n\n[Footnote d: See Appendix, N.\n\n[The impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868--which was resorted\nto by his political opponents solely as a means of turning him out of\noffice, for it could not be contended that he had been guilty of high\ncrimes and misdemeanors, and he was in fact honorably acquitted and\nreinstated in office--is a striking confirmation of the truth of this\nremark.--Translator's Note, 1874.]]\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part I\n\nI have hitherto considered each State as a separate whole, and I have\nexplained the different springs which the people sets in motion, and the\ndifferent means of action which it employs. But all the States which I\nhave considered as independent are forced to submit, in certain cases,\nto the supreme authority of the Union. The time is now come for me to\nexamine separately the supremacy with which the Union has been invested,\nand to cast a rapid glance over the Federal Constitution.\n\nChapter Summary\n\nOrigin of the first Union--Its weakness--Congress appeals to the\nconstituent authority--Interval of two years between this appeal and the\npromulgation of the new Constitution.\n\nHistory Of The Federal Constitution\n\n\nThe thirteen colonies which simultaneously threw off the yoke of\nEngland towards the end of the last century professed, as I have already\nobserved, the same religion, the same language, the same customs, and\nalmost the same laws; they were struggling against a common enemy; and\nthese reasons were sufficiently strong to unite them one to another, and\nto consolidate them into one nation. But as each of them had enjoyed a\nseparate existence and a government within its own control, the peculiar\ninterests and customs which resulted from this system were opposed to\na compact and intimate union which would have absorbed the individual\nimportance of each in the general importance of all. Hence arose two\nopposite tendencies, the one prompting the Anglo-Americans to unite,\nthe other to divide their strength. As long as the war with the\nmother-country lasted the principle of union was kept alive by\nnecessity; and although the laws which constituted it were defective,\nthe common tie subsisted in spite of their imperfections. *a But no\nsooner was peace concluded than the faults of the legislation became\nmanifest, and the State seemed to be suddenly dissolved. Each colony\nbecame an independent republic, and assumed an absolute sovereignty. The\nfederal government, condemned to impotence by its constitution, and\nno longer sustained by the presence of a common danger, witnessed the\noutrages offered to its flag by the great nations of Europe, whilst it\nwas scarcely able to maintain its ground against the Indian tribes, and\nto pay the interest of the debt which had been contracted during the\nwar of independence. It was already on the verge of destruction, when\nit officially proclaimed its inability to conduct the government, and\nappealed to the constituent authority of the nation. *b If America ever\napproached (for however brief a time) that lofty pinnacle of glory\nto which the fancy of its inhabitants is wont to point, it was at the\nsolemn moment at which the power of the nation abdicated, as it were,\nthe empire of the land. All ages have furnished the spectacle of a\npeople struggling with energy to win its independence; and the efforts\nof the Americans in throwing off the English yoke have been considerably\nexaggerated. Separated from their enemies by three thousand miles of\nocean, and backed by a powerful ally, the success of the United States\nmay be more justly attributed to their geographical position than to the\nvalor of their armies or the patriotism of their citizens. It would\nbe ridiculous to compare the American was to the wars of the French\nRevolution, or the efforts of the Americans to those of the French when\nthey were attacked by the whole of Europe, without credit and without\nallies, yet capable of opposing a twentieth part of their population to\nthe world, and of bearing the torch of revolution beyond their frontiers\nwhilst they stifled its devouring flame within the bosom of their\ncountry. But it is a novelty in the history of society to see a great\npeople turn a calm and scrutinizing eye upon itself, when apprised by\nthe legislature that the wheels of government are stopped; to see it\ncarefully examine the extent of the evil, and patiently wait for two\nwhole years until a remedy was discovered, which it voluntarily adopted\nwithout having wrung a tear or a drop of blood from mankind. At the time\nwhen the inadequacy of the first constitution was discovered America\npossessed the double advantage of that calm which had succeeded the\neffervescence of the revolution, and of those great men who had led the\nrevolution to a successful issue. The assembly which accepted the task\nof composing the second constitution was small; *c but George Washington\nwas its President, and it contained the choicest talents and the\nnoblest hearts which had ever appeared in the New World. This national\ncommission, after long and mature deliberation, offered to the\nacceptance of the people the body of general laws which still rules\nthe Union. All the States adopted it successively. *d The new Federal\nGovernment commenced its functions in 1789, after an interregnum of two\nyears. The Revolution of America terminated when that of France began.\n\n[Footnote a: See the articles of the first confederation formed in 1778.\nThis constitution was not adopted by all the States until 1781. See also\nthe analysis given of this constitution in \"The Federalist\" from No. 15\nto No. 22, inclusive, and Story's \"Commentaries on the Constitution of\nthe United States,\" pp. 85-115.]\n\n[Footnote b: Congress made this declaration on February 21, 1787.]\n\n[Footnote c: It consisted of fifty-five members; Washington, Madison,\nHamilton, and the two Morrises were amongst the number.]\n\n[Footnote d: It was not adopted by the legislative bodies, but\nrepresentatives were elected by the people for this sole purpose;\nand the new constitution was discussed at length in each of these\nassemblies.]\n\nSummary Of The Federal Constitution\n\nDivision of authority between the Federal Government and the States--The\nGovernment of the States is the rule, the Federal Government the\nexception.\n\nThe first question which awaited the Americans was intricate, and by no\nmeans easy of solution: the object was so to divide the authority of\nthe different States which composed the Union that each of them should\ncontinue to govern itself in all that concerned its internal prosperity,\nwhilst the entire nation, represented by the Union, should continue to\nform a compact body, and to provide for the general exigencies of the\npeople. It was as impossible to determine beforehand, with any degree\nof accuracy, the share of authority which each of two governments was to\nenjoy, as to foresee all the incidents in the existence of a nation.\n\nThe obligations and the claims of the Federal Government were simple\nand easily definable, because the Union had been formed with the express\npurpose of meeting the general exigencies of the people; but the claims\nand obligations of the States were, on the other hand, complicated and\nvarious, because those Governments had penetrated into all the details\nof social life. The attributes of the Federal Government were therefore\ncarefully enumerated and all that was not included amongst them\nwas declared to constitute a part of the privileges of the several\nGovernments of the States. Thus the government of the States remained\nthe rule, and that of the Confederation became the exception. *e\n\n[Footnote e: See the Amendment to the Federal Constitution;\n\"Federalist,\" No. 32; Story, p. 711; Kent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. i. p.\n364.\n\nIt is to be observed that whenever the exclusive right of regulating\ncertain matters is not reserved to Congress by the Constitution, the\nStates may take up the affair until it is brought before the National\nAssembly. For instance, Congress has the right of making a general law\non bankruptcy, which, however, it neglects to do. Each State is then\nat liberty to make a law for itself. This point has been established by\ndiscussion in the law-courts, and may be said to belong more properly to\njurisprudence.]\n\nBut as it was foreseen that, in practice, questions might arise as to\nthe exact limits of this exceptional authority, and that it would be\ndangerous to submit these questions to the decision of the ordinary\ncourts of justice, established in the States by the States themselves,\na high Federal court was created, *f which was destined, amongst other\nfunctions, to maintain the balance of power which had been established\nby the Constitution between the two rival Governments. *g\n\n[Footnote f: The action of this court is indirect, as we shall hereafter\nshow.]\n\n[Footnote g: It is thus that \"The Federalist,\" No. 45, explains the\ndivision of supremacy between the Union and the States: \"The powers\ndelegated by the Constitution to the Federal Government are few and\ndefined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous\nand indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external\nobjects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce. The powers\nreserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which,\nin the ordinary course of affairs, concern the internal order and\nprosperity of the State.\" I shall often have occasion to quote \"The\nFederalist\" in this work. When the bill which has since become the\nConstitution of the United States was submitted to the approval of\nthe people, and the discussions were still pending, three men, who\nhad already acquired a portion of that celebrity which they have since\nenjoyed--John Jay, Hamilton, and Madison--formed an association with\nthe intention of explaining to the nation the advantages of the measure\nwhich was proposed. With this view they published a series of articles\nin the shape of a journal, which now form a complete treatise. They\nentitled their journal \"The Federalist,\" a name which has been retained\nin the work. \"The Federalist\" is an excellent book, which ought to\nbe familiar to the statesmen of all countries, although it especially\nconcerns America.]\n\nPrerogative Of The Federal Government\n\nPower of declaring war, making peace, and levying general taxes vested\nin the Federal Government--What part of the internal policy of the\ncountry it may direct--The Government of the Union in some respects more\ncentral than the King's Government in the old French monarchy.\n\nThe external relations of a people may be compared to those of private\nindividuals, and they cannot be advantageously maintained without the\nagency of a single head of a Government. The exclusive right of making\npeace and war, of concluding treaties of commerce, of raising armies,\nand equipping fleets, was granted to the Union. *h The necessity of\na national Government was less imperiously felt in the conduct of the\ninternal policy of society; but there are certain general interests\nwhich can only be attended to with advantage by a general authority. The\nUnion was invested with the power of controlling the monetary system, of\ndirecting the post office, and of opening the great roads which were to\nestablish a communication between the different parts of the country. *i\nThe independence of the Government of each State was formally recognized\nin its sphere; nevertheless, the Federal Government was authorized\nto interfere in the internal affairs of the States *j in a few\npredetermined cases, in which an indiscreet abuse of their independence\nmight compromise the security of the Union at large. Thus, whilst\nthe power of modifying and changing their legislation at pleasure was\npreserved in all the republics, they were forbidden to enact ex post\nfacto laws, or to create a class of nobles in their community. *k\nLastly, as it was necessary that the Federal Government should be able\nto fulfil its engagements, it was endowed with an unlimited power of\nlevying taxes. *l\n\n[Footnote h: See Constitution, sect. 8; \"Federalist,\" Nos. 41 and 42;\nKent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. i. p. 207; Story, pp. 358-382; Ibid. pp.\n409-426.]\n\n[Footnote i: Several other privileges of the same kind exist, such\nas that which empowers the Union to legislate on bankruptcy, to\ngrant patents, and other matters in which its intervention is clearly\nnecessary.]\n\n[Footnote j: Even in these cases its interference is indirect.

I.]\n\n[Footnote l: Constitution, sects. 8, 9, and 10; \"Federalist,\" Nos.\n30-36, inclusive, and 41-44; Kent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. i. pp. 207 and\n381; Story, pp. 329 and 514.]\n\nIn examining the balance of power as established by the Federal\nConstitution; in remarking on the one hand the portion of sovereignty\nwhich has been reserved to the several States, and on the other the\nshare of power which the Union has assumed, it is evident that the\nFederal legislators entertained the clearest and most accurate notions\non the nature of the centralization of government. The United States\nform not only a republic, but a confederation; nevertheless the\nauthority of the nation is more central than it was in several of the\nmonarchies of Europe when the American Constitution was formed. Take,\nfor instance, the two following examples.\n\nThirteen supreme courts of justice existed in France, which, generally\nspeaking, had the right of interpreting the law without appeal; and\nthose provinces which were styled pays d'etats were authorized to refuse\ntheir assent to an impost which had been levied by the sovereign who\nrepresented the nation. In the Union there is but one tribunal to\ninterpret, as there is one legislature to make the laws; and an impost\nvoted by the representatives of the nation is binding upon all the\ncitizens. In these two essential points, therefore, the Union exercises\nmore central authority than the French monarchy possessed, although the\nUnion is only an assemblage of confederate republics.\n\nIn Spain certain provinces had the right of establishing a system of\ncustom-house duties peculiar to themselves, although that privilege\nbelongs, by its very nature, to the national sovereignty. In America the\nCongress alone has the right of regulating the commercial relations\nof the States. The government of the Confederation is therefore more\ncentralized in this respect than the kingdom of Spain. It is true that\nthe power of the Crown in France or in Spain was always able to obtain\nby force whatever the Constitution of the country denied, and that the\nultimate result was consequently the same; but I am here discussing the\ntheory of the Constitution.\n\nFederal Powers\n\nAfter having settled the limits within which the Federal Government\nwas to act, the next point was to determine the powers which it was to\nexert.\n\nLegislative Powers *m\n\n[Footnote m: [In this chapter the author points out the essence of the\nconflict between the seceding States and the Union which caused the\nCivil War of 1861.]]\n\nDivision of the Legislative Body into two branches--Difference in the\nmanner of forming the two Houses--The principle of the independence of\nthe States predominates in the formation of the Senate--The principle\nof the sovereignty of the nation in the composition of the House of\nRepresentatives--Singular effects of the fact that a Constitution can\nonly be logical in the early stages of a nation.\n\nThe plan which had been laid down beforehand for the Constitutions of\nthe several States was followed, in many points, in the organization\nof the powers of the Union. The Federal legislature of the Union\nwas composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives. A spirit of\nconciliation prescribed the observance of distinct principles in\nthe formation of these two assemblies. I have already shown that two\ncontrary interests were opposed to each other in the establishment of\nthe Federal Constitution. These two interests had given rise to two\nopinions. It was the wish of one party to convert the Union into a\nleague of independent States, or a sort of congress, at which the\nrepresentatives of the several peoples would meet to discuss certain\npoints of their common interests. The other party desired to unite\nthe inhabitants of the American colonies into one sole nation, and to\nestablish a Government which should act as the sole representative of\nthe nation, as far as the limited sphere of its authority would permit.\nThe practical consequences of these two theories were exceedingly\ndifferent.\n\nThe question was, whether a league was to be established instead of a\nnational Government; whether the majority of the State, instead of the\nmajority of the inhabitants of the Union, was to give the law: for every\nState, the small as well as the great, would then remain in the full\nenjoyment of its independence, and enter the Union upon a footing of\nperfect equality. If, however, the inhabitants of the United States were\nto be considered as belonging to one and the same nation, it would be\njust that the majority of the citizens of the Union should prescribe the\nlaw. Of course the lesser States could not subscribe to the application\nof this doctrine without, in fact, abdicating their existence in\nrelation to the sovereignty of the Confederation; since they would have\npassed from the condition of a co-equal and co-legislative authority to\nthat of an insignificant fraction of a great people. But if the former\nsystem would have invested them with an excessive authority, the\nlatter would have annulled their influence altogether. Under these\ncircumstances the result was, that the strict rules of logic were\nevaded, as is usually the case when interests are opposed to arguments.\nA middle course was hit upon by the legislators, which brought together\nby force two systems theoretically irreconcilable.\n\nThe principle of the independence of the States prevailed in the\nformation of the Senate, and that of the sovereignty of the nation\npredominated in the composition of the House of Representatives. It\nwas decided that each State should send two senators to Congress, and a\nnumber of representatives proportioned to its population. *n It results\nfrom this arrangement that the State of New York has at the present day\nforty representatives and only two senators; the State of Delaware\nhas two senators and only one representative; the State of Delaware\nis therefore equal to the State of New York in the Senate, whilst the\nlatter has forty times the influence of the former in the House of\nRepresentatives. Thus, if the minority of the nation preponderates in\nthe Senate,. it may paralyze the decisions of the majority represented\nin the other House, which is contrary to the spirit of constitutional\ngovernment.\n\n[Footnote n: Every ten years Congress fixes anew the number of\nrepresentatives which each State is to furnish. The total number was 69\nin 1789, and 240 in 1833. (See \"American Almanac,\" 1834, p. 194.)\nThe Constitution decided that there should not be more than one\nrepresentative for every 30,000 persons; but no minimum was fixed\non. The Congress has not thought fit to augment the number of\nrepresentatives in proportion to the increase of population. The first\nAct which was passed on the subject (April 14, 1792: see \"Laws of the\nUnited States,\" by Story, vol. i. p. 235) decided that there should be\none representative for every 33,000 inhabitants. The last Act, which was\npassed in 1832, fixes the proportion at one for 48,000. The population\nrepresented is composed of all the free men and of three-fifths of the\nslaves.\n\n[The last Act of apportionment, passed February 2, 1872, fixes the\nrepresentation at one to 134,684 inhabitants. There are now (1875) 283\nmembers of the lower House of Congress, and 9 for the States at large,\nmaking in all 292 members. The old States have of course lost the\nrepresentatives which the new States have gained.--Translator's Note.]]\n\nThese facts show how rare and how difficult it is rationally and\nlogically to combine all the several parts of legislation. In the\ncourse of time different interests arise, and different principles are\nsanctioned by the same people; and when a general constitution is to\nbe established, these interests and principles are so many natural\nobstacles to the rigorous application of any political system, with all\nits consequences. The early stages of national existence are the only\nperiods at which it is possible to maintain the complete logic of\nlegislation; and when we perceive a nation in the enjoyment of this\nadvantage, before we hasten to conclude that it is wise, we should do\nwell to remember that it is young. When the Federal Constitution was\nformed, the interests of independence for the separate States, and the\ninterest of union for the whole people, were the only two conflicting\ninterests which existed amongst the Anglo-Americans, and a compromise\nwas necessarily made between them.\n\nIt is, however, just to acknowledge that this part of the Constitution\nhas not hitherto produced those evils which might have been feared. All\nthe States are young and contiguous; their customs, their ideas, and\ntheir exigencies are not dissimilar; and the differences which result\nfrom their size or inferiority do not suffice to set their interests\nat variance. The small States have consequently never been induced to\nleague themselves together in the Senate to oppose the designs of the\nlarger ones; and indeed there is so irresistible an authority in the\nlegitimate expression of the will of a people that the Senate could\noffer but a feeble opposition to the vote of the majority of the House\nof Representatives.\n\nIt must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that it was not in the\npower of the American legislators to reduce to a single nation the\npeople for whom they were making laws. The object of the Federal\nConstitution was not to destroy the independence of the States, but\nto restrain it. By acknowledging the real authority of these secondary\ncommunities (and it was impossible to deprive them of it), they\ndisavowed beforehand the habitual use of constraint in enforcing g the\ndecisions of the majority. Upon this principle the introduction of the\ninfluence of the States into the mechanism of the Federal Government was\nby no means to be wondered at, since it only attested the existence of\nan acknowledged power, which was to be humored and not forcibly checked.\n\nA Further Difference Between The Senate And The House Of Representatives\n\nThe Senate named by the provincial legislators, the Representatives\nby the people--Double election of the former; single election of the\nlatter--Term of the different offices--Peculiar functions of each House.\n\nThe Senate not only differs from the other House in the principle which\nit represents, but also in the mode of its election, in the term for\nwhich it is chosen, and in the nature of its functions. The House of\nRepresentatives is named by the people, the Senate by the legislators of\neach State; the former is directly elected, the latter is elected by an\nelected body; the term for which the representatives are chosen is only\ntwo years, that of the senators is six. The functions of the House of\nRepresentatives are purely legislative, and the only share it takes in\nthe judicial power is in the impeachment of public officers. The Senate\nco-operates in the work of legislation, and tries those political\noffences which the House of Representatives submits to its decision.\nIt also acts as the great executive council of the nation; the treaties\nwhich are concluded by the President must be ratified by the Senate,\nand the appointments he may make must be definitely approved by the same\nbody. *o\n\n[Footnote o: See \"The Federalist,\" Nos. 52-56, inclusive; Story,\npp. 199-314; Constitution of the United States, sects. 2 and 3.] The\nExecutive Power *p\n\n[Footnote p: See \"The Federalist,\" Nos. 67-77; Constitution of\nthe United States, art. 2; Story, p. 315, pp. 615-780; Kent's\n\"Commentaries,\" p. 255.]\n\nDependence of the President--He is elective and responsible--He is\nfree to act in his own sphere under the inspection, but not under\nthe direction, of the Senate--His salary fixed at his entry into\noffice--Suspensive veto.\n\nThe American legislators undertook a difficult task in attempting to\ncreate an executive power dependent on the majority of the people, and\nnevertheless sufficiently strong to act without restraint in its own\nsphere. It was indispensable to the maintenance of the republican form\nof government that the representative of the executive power should be\nsubject to the will of the nation.\n\nThe President is an elective magistrate. His honor, his property, his\nliberty, and his life are the securities which the people has for the\ntemperate use of his power. But in the exercise of his authority he\ncannot be said to be perfectly independent; the Senate takes cognizance\nof his relations with foreign powers, and of the distribution of public\nappointments, so that he can neither be bribed nor can he employ the\nmeans of corruption. The legislators of the Union acknowledged that the\nexecutive power would be incompetent to fulfil its task with dignity and\nutility, unless it enjoyed a greater degree of stability and of strength\nthan had been granted to it in the separate States.\n\nThe President is chosen for four years, and he may be reelected; so that\nthe chances of a prolonged administration may inspire him with hopeful\nundertakings for the public good, and with the means of carrying them\ninto execution. The President was made the sole representative of the\nexecutive power of the Union, and care was taken not to render his\ndecisions subordinate to the vote of a council--a dangerous measure,\nwhich tends at the same time to clog the action of the Government and\nto diminish its responsibility. The Senate has the right of annulling\ng certain acts of the President; but it cannot compel him to take any\nsteps, nor does it participate in the exercise of the executive power.\n\nThe action of the legislature on the executive power may be direct; and\nwe have just shown that the Americans carefully obviated this influence;\nbut it may, on the other hand, be indirect. Public assemblies which have\nthe power of depriving an officer of state of his salary encroach upon\nhis independence; and as they are free to make the laws, it is to be\nfeared lest they should gradually appropriate to themselves a portion\nof that authority which the Constitution had vested in his hands. This\ndependence of the executive power is one of the defects inherent in\nrepublican constitutions. The Americans have not been able to counteract\nthe tendency which legislative assemblies have to get possession of the\ngovernment, but they have rendered this propensity less irresistible.\nThe salary of the President is fixed, at the time of his entering\nupon office, for the whole period of his magistracy. The President is,\nmoreover, provided with a suspensive veto, which allows him to oppose\nthe passing of such laws as might destroy the portion of independence\nwhich the Constitution awards him. The struggle between the President\nand the legislature must always be an unequal one, since the latter is\ncertain of bearing down all resistance by persevering in its plans; but\nthe suspensive veto forces it at least to reconsider the matter, and,\nif the motion be persisted in, it must then be backed by a majority of\ntwo-thirds of the whole house. The veto is, in fact, a sort of appeal\nto the people. The executive power, which, without this security, might\nhave been secretly oppressed, adopts this means of pleading its\ncause and stating its motives. But if the legislature is certain of\noverpowering all resistance by persevering in its plans, I reply, that\nin the constitutions of all nations, of whatever kind they may be, a\ncertain point exists at which the legislator is obliged to have recourse\nto the good sense and the virtue of his fellow-citizens. This point is\nmore prominent and more discoverable in republics, whilst it is more\nremote and more carefully concealed in monarchies, but it always exists\nsomewhere. There is no country in the world in which everything can be\nprovided for by the laws, or in which political institutions can prove a\nsubstitute for common sense and public morality.\n\nDifferences Between The Position Of The President Of The United States\nAnd That Of A Constitutional King Of France\n\nExecutive power in the Northern States as limited and as partial as the\nsupremacy which it represents--Executive power in France as universal as\nthe supremacy it represents--The King a branch of the legislature--The\nPresident the mere executor of the law--Other differences resulting from\nthe duration of the two powers--The President checked in the exercise\nof the executive authority--The King independent in its\nexercise--Notwithstanding these discrepancies France is more akin to\na republic than the Union to a monarchy--Comparison of the number of\npublic officers depending upon the executive power in the two countries.\n\nThe executive power has so important an influence on the destinies of\nnations that I am inclined to pause for an instant at this portion of\nmy subject, in order more clearly to explain the part it sustains\nin America. In order to form an accurate idea of the position of the\nPresident of the United States, it may not be irrelevant to compare it\nto that of one of the constitutional kings of Europe. In this comparison\nI shall pay but little attention to the external signs of power, which\nare more apt to deceive the eye of the observer than to guide his\nresearches. When a monarchy is being gradually transformed into a\nrepublic, the executive power retains the titles, the honors, the\netiquette, and even the funds of royalty long after its authority has\ndisappeared. The English, after having cut off the head of one king\nand expelled another from his throne, were accustomed to accost the\nsuccessor of those princes upon their knees. On the other hand, when a\nrepublic falls under the sway of a single individual, the demeanor of\nthe sovereign is simple and unpretending, as if his authority was not\nyet paramount. When the emperors exercised an unlimited control over\nthe fortunes and the lives of their fellow-citizens, it was customary to\ncall them Caesar in conversation, and they were in the habit of supping\nwithout formality at their friends' houses. It is therefore necessary to\nlook below the surface.\n\nThe sovereignty of the United States is shared between the Union and the\nStates, whilst in France it is undivided and compact: hence arises the\nfirst and the most notable difference which exists between the President\nof the United States and the King of France. In the United States the\nexecutive power is as limited and partial as the sovereignty of the\nUnion in whose name it acts; in France it is as universal as the\nauthority of the State. The Americans have a federal and the French a\nnational Government.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part II\n\nThis cause of inferiority results from the nature of things, but it is\nnot the only one; the second in importance is as follows: Sovereignty\nmay be defined to be the right of making laws: in France, the King\nreally exercises a portion of the sovereign power, since the laws have\nno weight till he has given his assent to them; he is, moreover, the\nexecutor of all they ordain. The President is also the executor of the\nlaws, but he does not really co-operate in their formation, since the\nrefusal of his assent does not annul them. He is therefore merely to be\nconsidered as the agent of the sovereign power. But not only does\nthe King of France exercise a portion of the sovereign power, he also\ncontributes to the nomination of the legislature, which exercises the\nother portion. He has the privilege of appointing the members of one\nchamber, and of dissolving the other at his pleasure; whereas the\nPresident of the United States has no share in the formation of the\nlegislative body, and cannot dissolve any part of it. The King has the\nsame right of bringing forward measures as the Chambers; a right which\nthe President does not possess. The King is represented in each assembly\nby his ministers, who explain his intentions, support his opinions,\nand maintain the principles of the Government. The President and his\nministers are alike excluded from Congress; so that his influence and\nhis opinions can only penetrate indirectly into that great body. The\nKing of France is therefore on an equal footing with the legislature,\nwhich can no more act without him than he can without it. The President\nexercises an authority inferior to, and depending upon, that of the\nlegislature.\n\nEven in the exercise of the executive power, properly so called--the\npoint upon which his position seems to be most analogous to that of\nthe King of France--the President labors under several causes of\ninferiority. The authority of the King, in France, has, in the first\nplace, the advantage of duration over that of the President, and\ndurability is one of the chief elements of strength; nothing is either\nloved or feared but what is likely to endure. The President of the\nUnited States is a magistrate elected for four years; the King, in\nFrance, is an hereditary sovereign. In the exercise of the executive\npower the President of the United States is constantly subject to a\njealous scrutiny. He may make, but he cannot conclude, a treaty; he\nmay designate, but he cannot appoint, a public officer. *q The King of\nFrance is absolute within the limits of his authority. The President of\nthe United States is responsible for his actions; but the person of the\nKing is declared inviolable by the French Charter. *r\n\n[Footnote q: The Constitution had left it doubtful whether the President\nwas obliged to consult the Senate in the removal as well as in the\nappointment of Federal officers. \"The Federalist\" (No. 77) seemed to\nestablish the affirmative; but in 1789 Congress formally decided that,\nas the President was responsible for his actions, he ought not to\nbe forced to employ agents who had forfeited his esteem. See Kent's\n\"Commentaries\", vol. i. p. 289.]\n\n[Footnote r: [This comparison applied to the Constitutional King of\nFrance and to the powers he held under the Charter of 1830, till the\noverthrow of the monarchy in 1848.--Translator's Note.]]\n\nNevertheless, the supremacy of public opinion is no less above the head\nof the one than of the other. This power is less definite, less evident,\nand less sanctioned by the laws in France than in America, but in fact\nit exists. In America, it acts by elections and decrees; in France it\nproceeds by revolutions; but notwithstanding the different constitutions\nof these two countries, public opinion is the predominant authority\nin both of them. The fundamental principle of legislation--a principle\nessentially republican--is the same in both countries, although its\nconsequences may be different, and its results more or less extensive.\nWhence I am led to conclude that France with its King is nearer akin to\na republic than the Union with its President is to a monarchy.\n\nIn what I have been saying I have only touched upon the main points\nof distinction; and if I could have entered into details, the contrast\nwould have been rendered still more striking. I have remarked that the\nauthority of the President in the United States is only exercised within\nthe limits of a partial sovereignty, whilst that of the King in France\nis undivided. I might have gone on to show that the power of the King's\ngovernment in France exceeds its natural limits, however extensive\nthey may be, and penetrates in a thousand different ways into the\nadministration of private interests. Amongst the examples of this\ninfluence may be quoted that which results from the great number\nof public functionaries, who all derive their appointments from the\nGovernment. This number now exceeds all previous limits; it amounts to\n138,000 *s nominations, each of which may be considered as an element of\npower. The President of the United States has not the exclusive right of\nmaking any public appointments, and their whole number scarcely exceeds\n12,000. *t\n\n[Footnote s: The sums annually paid by the State to these officers\namount to 200,000,000 fr. ($40,000,000).]\n\n[Footnote t: This number is extracted from the \"National Calendar\" for\n1833. The \"National Calendar\" is an American almanac which contains the\nnames of all the Federal officers. It results from this comparison that\nthe King of France has eleven times as many places at his disposal as\nthe President, although the population of France is not much more than\ndouble that of the Union.\n\n[I have not the means of ascertaining the number of appointments now at\nthe disposal of the President of the United States, but his patronage\nand the abuse of it have largely increased since 1833.--Translator's\nNote, 1875.]]\n\nAccidental Causes Which May Increase The Influence Of The Executive\nGovernment\n\nExternal security of the Union--Army of six thousand men--Few ships--The\nPresident has no opportunity of exercising his great prerogatives--In\nthe prerogatives he exercises he is weak.\n\nIf the executive government is feebler in America than in France, the\ncause is more attributable to the circumstances than to the laws of the\ncountry.\n\nIt is chiefly in its foreign relations that the executive power of a\nnation is called upon to exert its skill and its vigor. If the existence\nof the Union were perpetually threatened, and if its chief interests\nwere in daily connection with those of other powerful nations, the\nexecutive government would assume an increased importance in proportion\nto the measures expected of it, and those which it would carry into\neffect. The President of the United States is the commander-in-chief of\nthe army, but of an army composed of only six thousand men; he commands\nthe fleet, but the fleet reckons but few sail; he conducts the foreign\nrelations of the Union, but the United States are a nation without\nneighbors. Separated from the rest of the world by the ocean, and too\nweak as yet to aim at the dominion of the seas, they have no enemies,\nand their interests rarely come into contact with those of any other\nnation of the globe.\n\nThe practical part of a Government must not be judged by the theory\nof its constitution. The President of the United States is in the\npossession of almost royal prerogatives, which he has no opportunity of\nexercising; and those privileges which he can at present use are very\ncircumscribed. The laws allow him to possess a degree of influence which\ncircumstances do not permit him to employ.\n\nOn the other hand, the great strength of the royal prerogative in\nFrance arises from circumstances far more than from the laws. There\nthe executive government is constantly struggling against prodigious\nobstacles, and exerting all its energies to repress them; so that it\nincreases by the extent of its achievements, and by the importance of\nthe events it controls, without modifying its constitution. If the laws\nhad made it as feeble and as circumscribed as it is in the Union, its\ninfluence would very soon become still more preponderant.\n\nWhy The President Of The United States Does Not Require The Majority Of\nThe Two Houses In Order To Carry On The Government It is an established\naxiom in Europe that a constitutional King cannot persevere in a\nsystem of government which is opposed by the two other branches of the\nlegislature. But several Presidents of the United States have been known\nto lose the majority in the legislative body without being obliged to\nabandon the supreme power, and without inflicting a serious evil\nupon society. I have heard this fact quoted as an instance of the\nindependence and the power of the executive government in America: a\nmoment's reflection will convince us, on the contrary, that it is a\nproof of its extreme weakness.\n\nA King in Europe requires the support of the legislature to enable him\nto perform the duties imposed upon him by the Constitution, because\nthose duties are enormous. A constitutional King in Europe is not merely\nthe executor of the law, but the execution of its provisions devolves so\ncompletely upon him that he has the power of paralyzing its influence\nif it opposes his designs. He requires the assistance of the legislative\nassemblies to make the law, but those assemblies stand in need of his\naid to execute it: these two authorities cannot subsist without each\nother, and the mechanism of government is stopped as soon as they are at\nvariance.\n\nIn America the President cannot prevent any law from being passed, nor\ncan he evade the obligation of enforcing it. His sincere and zealous\nco-operation is no doubt useful, but it is not indispensable, in the\ncarrying on of public affairs. All his important acts are directly or\nindirectly submitted to the legislature, and of his own free authority\nhe can do but little. It is therefore his weakness, and not his power,\nwhich enables him to remain in opposition to Congress. In Europe,\nharmony must reign between the Crown and the other branches of the\nlegislature, because a collision between them may prove serious; in\nAmerica, this harmony is not indispensable, because such a collision is\nimpossible.\n\nElection Of The President\n\n\nDangers of the elective system increase in proportion to the extent of\nthe prerogative--This system possible in America because no powerful\nexecutive authority is required--What circumstances are favorable to\nthe elective system--Why the election of the President does not cause\na deviation from the principles of the Government--Influence of the\nelection of the President on secondary functionaries.\n\nThe dangers of the system of election applied to the head of the\nexecutive government of a great people have been sufficiently\nexemplified by experience and by history, and the remarks I am about\nto make refer to America alone. These dangers may be more or less\nformidable in proportion to the place which the executive power\noccupies, and to the importance it possesses in the State; and they may\nvary according to the mode of election and the circumstances in which\nthe electors are placed. The most weighty argument against the election\nof a chief magistrate is, that it offers so splendid a lure to private\nambition, and is so apt to inflame men in the pursuit of power, that\nwhen legitimate means are wanting force may not unfrequently seize what\nright denied.\n\nIt is clear that the greater the privileges of the executive authority\nare, the greater is the temptation; the more the ambition of the\ncandidates is excited, the more warmly are their interests espoused by\na throng of partisans who hope to share the power when their patron has\nwon the prize. The dangers of the elective system increase, therefore,\nin the exact ratio of the influence exercised by the executive power\nin the affairs of State. The revolutions of Poland were not solely\nattributable to the elective system in general, but to the fact that the\nelected monarch was the sovereign of a powerful kingdom. Before we can\ndiscuss the absolute advantages of the elective system we must make\npreliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws,\nthe habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people amongst whom\nit is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak\nand dependent executive government; for to attempt to render the\nrepresentative of the State a powerful sovereign, and at the same time\nelective, is, in my opinion, to entertain two incompatible designs. To\nreduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective authority, the\nonly means that I am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere\nof action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to\naccustom the people to live without its protection. Nothing, however, is\nfurther from the designs of the republicans of Europe than this course:\nas many of them owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings which they\nhave personally undergone, it is oppression, and not the extent of the\nexecutive power, which excites their hostility, and they attack the\nformer without perceiving how nearly it is connected with the latter.\n\nHitherto no citizen has shown any disposition to expose his honor and\nhis life in order to become the President of the United States; because\nthe power of that office is temporary, limited, and subordinate. The\nprize of fortune must be great to encourage adventurers in so desperate\na game. No candidate has as yet been able to arouse the dangerous\nenthusiasm or the passionate sympathies of the people in his favor, for\nthe very simple reason that when he is at the head of the Government he\nhas but little power, but little wealth, and but little glory to share\namongst his friends; and his influence in the State is too small for\nthe success or the ruin of a faction to depend upon the elevation of an\nindividual to power.\n\nThe great advantage of hereditary monarchies is, that as the private\ninterest of a family is always intimately connected with the interests\nof the State, the executive government is never suspended for a single\ninstant; and if the affairs of a monarchy are not better conducted than\nthose of a republic, at least there is always some one to conduct them,\nwell or ill, according to his capacity. In elective States, on the\ncontrary, the wheels of government cease to act, as it were, of their\nown accord at the approach of an election, and even for some time\nprevious to that event. The laws may indeed accelerate the operation of\nthe election, which may be conducted with such simplicity and rapidity\nthat the seat of power will never be left vacant; but, notwithstanding\nthese precautions, a break necessarily occurs in the minds of the\npeople.\n\nAt the approach of an election the head of the executive government is\nwholly occupied by the coming struggle; his future plans are doubtful;\nhe can undertake nothing new, and the he will only prosecute with\nindifference those designs which another will perhaps terminate. \"I am\nso near the time of my retirement from office,\" said President Jefferson\non the 21st of January, 1809 (six weeks before the election), \"that I\nfeel no passion, I take no part, I express no sentiment. It appears\nto me just to leave to my successor the commencement of those measures\nwhich he will have to prosecute, and for which he will be responsible.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the eyes of the nation are centred on a single point;\nall are watching the gradual birth of so important an event. The wider\nthe influence of the executive power extends, the greater and the\nmore necessary is its constant action, the more fatal is the term of\nsuspense; and a nation which is accustomed to the government, or, still\nmore, one used to the administrative protection of a powerful executive\nauthority would be infallibly convulsed by an election of this kind.\nIn the United States the action of the Government may be slackened with\nimpunity, because it is always weak and circumscribed. *u\n\n[Footnote u: [This, however, may be a great danger. The period during\nwhich Mr. Buchanan retained office, after the election of Mr. Lincoln,\nfrom November, 1860, to March, 1861, was that which enabled the seceding\nStates of the South to complete their preparations for the Civil War,\nand the Executive Government was paralyzed. No greater evil could befall\na nation.--Translator's Note.]]\n\nOne of the principal vices of the elective system is that it always\nintroduces a certain degree of instability into the internal and\nexternal policy of the State. But this disadvantage is less sensibly\nfelt if the share of power vested in the elected magistrate is small. In\nRome the principles of the Government underwent no variation, although\nthe Consuls were changed every year, because the Senate, which was an\nhereditary assembly, possessed the directing authority. If the elective\nsystem were adopted in Europe, the condition of most of the monarchical\nStates would be changed at every new election. In America the President\nexercises a certain influence on State affairs, but he does not conduct\nthem; the preponderating power is vested in the representatives of the\nwhole nation. The political maxims of the country depend therefore on\nthe mass of the people, not on the President alone; and consequently\nin America the elective system has no very prejudicial influence on the\nfixed principles of the Government. But the want of fixed principles is\nan evil so inherent in the elective system that it is still extremely\nperceptible in the narrow sphere to which the authority of the President\nextends.\n\nThe Americans have admitted that the head of the executive power, who\nhas to bear the whole responsibility of the duties he is called upon to\nfulfil, ought to be empowered to choose his own agents, and to remove\nthem at pleasure: the legislative bodies watch the conduct of the\nPresident more than they direct it. The consequence of this arrangement\nis, that at every new election the fate of all the Federal public\nofficers is in suspense. Mr. Quincy Adams, on his entry into office,\ndischarged the majority of the individuals who had been appointed by his\npredecessor: and I am not aware that General Jackson allowed a single\nremovable functionary employed in the Federal service to retain\nhis place beyond the first year which succeeded his election. It\nis sometimes made a subject of complaint that in the constitutional\nmonarchies of Europe the fate of the humbler servants of an\nAdministration depends upon that of the Ministers. But in elective\nGovernments this evil is far greater. In a constitutional monarchy\nsuccessive ministries are rapidly formed; but as the principal\nrepresentative of the executive power does not change, the spirit of\ninnovation is kept within bounds; the changes which take place are in\nthe details rather than in the principles of the administrative system;\nbut to substitute one system for another, as is done in America\nevery four years, by law, is to cause a sort of revolution. As to the\nmisfortunes which may fall upon individuals in consequence of this state\nof things, it must be allowed that the uncertain situation of the\npublic officers is less fraught with evil consequences in America than\nelsewhere. It is so easy to acquire an independent position in the\nUnited States that the public officer who loses his place may be\ndeprived of the comforts of life, but not of the means of subsistence.\n\nI remarked at the beginning of this chapter that the dangers of the\nelective system applied to the head of the State are augmented or\ndecreased by the peculiar circumstances of the people which adopts it.\nHowever the functions of the executive power may be restricted, it\nmust always exercise a great influence upon the foreign policy of the\ncountry, for a negotiation cannot be opened or successfully carried\non otherwise than by a single agent. The more precarious and the more\nperilous the position of a people becomes, the more absolute is the want\nof a fixed and consistent external policy, and the more dangerous does\nthe elective system of the Chief Magistrate become. The policy of the\nAmericans in relation to the whole world is exceedingly simple; for it\nmay almost be said that no country stands in need of them, nor do they\nrequire the co-operation of any other people. Their independence is\nnever threatened. In their present condition, therefore, the functions\nof the executive power are no less limited by circumstances than by the\nlaws; and the President may frequently change his line of policy without\ninvolving the State in difficulty or destruction.\n\nWhatever the prerogatives of the executive power may be, the period\nwhich immediately precedes an election and the moment of its duration\nmust always be considered as a national crisis, which is perilous in\nproportion to the internal embarrassments and the external dangers of\nthe country. Few of the nations of Europe could escape the calamities\nof anarchy or of conquest every time they might have to elect a new\nsovereign. In America society is so constituted that it can stand\nwithout assistance upon its own basis; nothing is to be feared from the\npressure of external dangers, and the election of the President is a\ncause of agitation, but not of ruin.\n\nMode Of Election\n\nSkill of the American legislators shown in the mode of election adopted\nby them--Creation of a special electoral body--Separate votes of these\nelectors--Case in which the House of Representatives is called upon to\nchoose the President--Results of the twelve elections which have taken\nplace since the Constitution has been established.\n\nBesides the dangers which are inherent in the system, many other\ndifficulties may arise from the mode of election, which may be obviated\nby the precaution of the legislator. When a people met in arms on some\npublic spot to choose its head, it was exposed to all the chances of\ncivil war resulting from so martial a mode of proceeding, besides\nthe dangers of the elective system in itself. The Polish laws, which\nsubjected the election of the sovereign to the veto of a single\nindividual, suggested the murder of that individual or prepared the way\nto anarchy.\n\nIn the examination of the institutions and the political as well as\nsocial condition of the United States, we are struck by the admirable\nharmony of the gifts of fortune and the efforts of man. The nation\npossessed two of the main causes of internal peace; it was a new\ncountry, but it was inhabited by a people grown old in the exercise of\nfreedom. America had no hostile neighbors to dread; and the American\nlegislators, profiting by these favorable circumstances, created a\nweak and subordinate executive power which could without danger be made\nelective.\n\nIt then only remained for them to choose the least dangerous of the\nvarious modes of election; and the rules which they laid down upon this\npoint admirably correspond to the securities which the physical and\npolitical constitution of the country already afforded. Their object was\nto find the mode of election which would best express the choice of the\npeople with the least possible excitement and suspense. It was admitted\nin the first place that the simple majority should be decisive; but\nthe difficulty was to obtain this majority without an interval of\ndelay which it was most important to avoid. It rarely happens that an\nindividual can at once collect the majority of the suffrages of a great\npeople; and this difficulty is enhanced in a republic of confederate\nStates, where local influences are apt to preponderate. The means by\nwhich it was proposed to obviate this second obstacle was to delegate\nthe electoral powers of the nation to a body of representatives. This\nmode of election rendered a majority more probable; for the fewer the\nelectors are, the greater is the chance of their coming to a final\ndecision. It also offered an additional probability of a judicious\nchoice. It then remained to be decided whether this right of election\nwas to be entrusted to a legislative body, the habitual representative\nassembly of the nation, or whether an electoral assembly should be\nformed for the express purpose of proceeding to the nomination of a\nPresident. The Americans chose the latter alternative, from a belief\nthat the individuals who were returned to make the laws were incompetent\nto represent the wishes of the nation in the election of its chief\nmagistrate; and that, as they are chosen for more than a year, the\nconstituency they represent might have changed its opinion in that time.\nIt was thought that if the legislature was empowered to elect the head\nof the executive power, its members would, for some time before the\nelection, be exposed to the manoeuvres of corruption and the tricks of\nintrigue; whereas the special electors would, like a jury, remain mixed\nup with the crowd till the day of action, when they would appear for the\nsole purpose of giving their votes.\n\nIt was therefore established that every State should name a certain\nnumber of electors, *v who in their turn should elect the President;\nand as it had been observed that the assemblies to which the choice of\na chief magistrate had been entrusted in elective countries inevitably\nbecame the centres of passion and of cabal; that they sometimes usurped\nan authority which did not belong to them; and that their proceedings,\nor the uncertainty which resulted from them, were sometimes prolonged so\nmuch as to endanger the welfare of the State, it was determined that the\nelectors should all vote upon the same day, without being convoked to\nthe same place. *w This double election rendered a majority probable,\nthough not certain; for it was possible that as many differences might\nexist between the electors as between their constituents. In this case\nit was necessary to have recourse to one of three measures; either\nto appoint new electors, or to consult a second time those already\nappointed, or to defer the election to another authority. The first\ntwo of these alternatives, independently of the uncertainty of their\nresults, were likely to delay the final decision, and to perpetuate\nan agitation which must always be accompanied with danger. The third\nexpedient was therefore adopted, and it was agreed that the votes should\nbe transmitted sealed to the President of the Senate, and that they\nshould be opened and counted in the presence of the Senate and the House\nof Representatives. If none of the candidates has a majority, the House\nof Representatives then proceeds immediately to elect a President, but\nwith the condition that it must fix upon one of the three candidates who\nhave the highest numbers. *x\n\n[Footnote v: As many as it sends members to Congress. The number of\nelectors at the election of 1833 was 288. (See \"The National Calendar,\"\n1833.)]\n\n[Footnote w: The electors of the same State assemble, but they transmit\nto the central government the list of their individual votes, and not\nthe mere result of the vote of the majority.] [Footnote x: In this case\nit is the majority of the States, and not the majority of the members,\nwhich decides the question; so that New York has not more influence in\nthe debate than Rhode Island. Thus the citizens of the Union are first\nconsulted as members of one and the same community; and, if they cannot\nagree, recourse is had to the division of the States, each of which has\na separate and independent vote. This is one of the singularities of\nthe Federal Constitution which can only be explained by the jar of\nconflicting interests.]\n\nThus it is only in case of an event which cannot often happen, and which\ncan never be foreseen, that the election is entrusted to the ordinary\nrepresentatives of the nation; and even then they are obliged to choose\na citizen who has already been designated by a powerful minority of the\nspecial electors. It is by this happy expedient that the respect which\nis due to the popular voice is combined with the utmost celerity of\nexecution and those precautions which the peace of the country demands.\nBut the decision of the question by the House of Representatives does\nnot necessarily offer an immediate solution of the difficulty, for the\nmajority of that assembly may still be doubtful, and in this case the\nConstitution prescribes no remedy. Nevertheless, by restricting the\nnumber of candidates to three, and by referring the matter to the\njudgment of an enlightened public body, it has smoothed all the\nobstacles *y which are not inherent in the elective system.\n\n[Footnote y: Jefferson, in 1801, was not elected until the thirty-sixth\ntime of balloting.]\n\n\nIn the forty-four years which have elapsed since the promulgation of\nthe Federal Constitution the United States have twelve times chosen a\nPresident. Ten of these elections took place simultaneously by the\nvotes of the special electors in the different States. The House of\nRepresentatives has only twice exercised its conditional privilege of\ndeciding in cases of uncertainty; the first time was at the election of\nMr. Jefferson in 1801; the second was in 1825, when Mr. Quincy Adams was\nnamed. *z\n\n[Footnote z: [General Grant is now (1874) the eighteenth President of\nthe United States.]]\n\nCrises Of The Election\n\nThe Election may be considered as a national crisis--Why?--Passions of\nthe people--Anxiety of the President--Calm which succeeds the agitation\nof the election.\n\nI have shown what the circumstances are which favored the adoption of\nthe elective system in the United States, and what precautions were\ntaken by the legislators to obviate its dangers. The Americans are\nhabitually accustomed to all kinds of elections, and they know by\nexperience the utmost degree of excitement which is compatible with\nsecurity. The vast extent of the country and the dissemination of the\ninhabitants render a collision between parties less probable and less\ndangerous there than elsewhere. The political circumstances under which\nthe elections have hitherto been carried on have presented no real\nembarrassments to the nation.\n\nNevertheless, the epoch of the election of a President of the United\nStates may be considered as a crisis in the affairs of the nation. The\ninfluence which he exercises on public business is no doubt feeble and\nindirect; but the choice of the President, which is of small importance\nto each individual citizen, concerns the citizens collectively; and\nhowever trifling an interest may be, it assumes a great degree of\nimportance as soon as it becomes general. The President possesses but\nfew means of rewarding his supporters in comparison to the kings of\nEurope, but the places which are at his disposal are sufficiently\nnumerous to interest, directly or indirectly, several thousand electors\nin his success. Political parties in the United States are led to rally\nround an individual, in order to acquire a more tangible shape in the\neyes of the crowd, and the name of the candidate for the Presidency is\nput forward as the symbol and personification of their theories. For\nthese reasons parties are strongly interested in gaining the election,\nnot so much with a view to the triumph of their principles under\nthe auspices of the President-elect as to show by the majority which\nreturned him, the strength of the supporters of those principles.\n\nFor a long while before the appointed time is at hand the election\nbecomes the most important and the all-engrossing topic of discussion.\nThe ardor of faction is redoubled; and all the artificial passions which\nthe imagination can create in the bosom of a happy and peaceful land\nare agitated and brought to light. The President, on the other hand,\nis absorbed by the cares of self-defence. He no longer governs for the\ninterest of the State, but for that of his re-election; he does homage\nto the majority, and instead of checking its passions, as his duty\ncommands him to do, he frequently courts its worst caprices. As the\nelection draws near, the activity of intrigue and the agitation of the\npopulace increase; the citizens are divided into hostile camps, each of\nwhich assumes the name of its favorite candidate; the whole nation glows\nwith feverish excitement; the election is the daily theme of the public\npapers, the subject of private conversation, the end of every thought\nand every action, the sole interest of the present. As soon as the\nchoice is determined, this ardor is dispelled; and as a calmer season\nreturns, the current of the State, which had nearly broken its banks,\nsinks to its usual level: *a but who can refrain from astonishment at\nthe causes of the storm.\n\n[Footnote a: [Not always. The election of President Lincoln was the\nsignal of civil war.--Translator's Note.]]\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part III\n\nRe-election Of The President\n\nWhen the head of the executive power is re-eligible, it is the State\nwhich is the source of intrigue and corruption--The desire of\nbeing re-elected the chief aim of a President of the United\nStates--Disadvantage of the system peculiar to America--The natural\nevil of democracy is that it subordinates all authority to the slightest\ndesires of the majority--The re-election of the President encourages\nthis evil.\n\nIt may be asked whether the legislators of the United States did right\nor wrong in allowing the re-election of the President. It seems at first\nsight contrary to all reason to prevent the head of the executive power\nfrom being elected a second time. The influence which the talents and\nthe character of a single individual may exercise upon the fate of a\nwhole people, in critical circumstances or arduous times, is well known:\na law preventing the re-election of the chief magistrate would deprive\nthe citizens of the surest pledge of the prosperity and the security\nof the commonwealth; and, by a singular inconsistency, a man would be\nexcluded from the government at the very time when he had shown his\nability in conducting its affairs.\n\nBut if these arguments are strong, perhaps still more powerful reasons\nmay be advanced against them. Intrigue and corruption are the natural\ndefects of elective government; but when the head of the State can be\nre-elected these evils rise to a great height, and compromise the very\nexistence of the country. When a simple candidate seeks to rise by\nintrigue, his manoeuvres must necessarily be limited to a narrow sphere;\nbut when the chief magistrate enters the lists, he borrows the strength\nof the government for his own purposes. In the former case the feeble\nresources of an individual are in action; in the latter, the State\nitself, with all its immense influence, is busied in the work of\ncorruption and cabal. The private citizen, who employs the most\nimmoral practices to acquire power, can only act in a manner indirectly\nprejudicial to the public prosperity. But if the representative of the\nexecutive descends into the combat, the cares of government dwindle into\nsecond-rate importance, and the success of his election is his first\nconcern. All laws and all the negotiations he undertakes are to him\nnothing more than electioneering schemes; places become the reward\nof services rendered, not to the nation, but to its chief; and the\ninfluence of the government, if not injurious to the country, is at\nleast no longer beneficial to the community for which it was created.\n\nIt is impossible to consider the ordinary course of affairs in the\nUnited States without perceiving that the desire of being re-elected is\nthe chief aim of the President; that his whole administration, and even\nhis most indifferent measures, tend to this object; and that, as the\ncrisis approaches, his personal interest takes the place of his interest\nin the public good. The principle of re-eligibility renders the corrupt\ninfluence of elective government still more extensive and pernicious.\n\nIn America it exercises a peculiarly fatal influence on the sources of\nnational existence. Every government seems to be afflicted by some evil\nwhich is inherent in its nature, and the genius of the legislator is\nshown in eluding its attacks. A State may survive the influence of a\nhost of bad laws, and the mischief they cause is frequently exaggerated;\nbut a law which encourages the growth of the canker within must prove\nfatal in the end, although its bad consequences may not be immediately\nperceived.\n\nThe principle of destruction in absolute monarchies lies in the\nexcessive and unreasonable extension of the prerogative of the crown;\nand a measure tending to remove the constitutional provisions which\ncounterbalance this influence would be radically bad, even if its\nimmediate consequences were unattended with evil. By a parity of\nreasoning, in countries governed by a democracy, where the people is\nperpetually drawing all authority to itself, the laws which increase or\naccelerate its action are the direct assailants of the very principle of\nthe government.\n\nThe greatest proof of the ability of the American legislators is, that\nthey clearly discerned this truth, and that they had the courage to act\nup to it. They conceived that a certain authority above the body of\nthe people was necessary, which should enjoy a degree of independence,\nwithout, however, being entirely beyond the popular control;\nan authority which would be forced to comply with the permanent\ndeterminations of the majority, but which would be able to resist its\ncaprices, and to refuse its most dangerous demands. To this end they\ncentred the whole executive power of the nation in a single arm; they\ngranted extensive prerogatives to the President, and they armed him with\nthe veto to resist the encroachments of the legislature.\n\nBut by introducing the principle of re-election they partly destroyed\ntheir work; and they rendered the President but little inclined to exert\nthe great power they had vested in his hands. If ineligible a second\ntime, the President would be far from independent of the people, for his\nresponsibility would not be lessened; but the favor of the people would\nnot be so necessary to him as to induce him to court it by humoring its\ndesires. If re-eligible (and this is more especially true at the present\nday, when political morality is relaxed, and when great men are rare),\nthe President of the United States becomes an easy tool in the hands of\nthe majority. He adopts its likings and its animosities, he hastens to\nanticipate its wishes, he forestalls its complaints, he yields to its\nidlest cravings, and instead of guiding it, as the legislature intended\nthat he should do, he is ever ready to follow its bidding. Thus, in\norder not to deprive the State of the talents of an individual, those\ntalents have been rendered almost useless; and to reserve an expedient\nfor extraordinary perils, the country has been exposed to daily dangers.\n\nFederal Courts *b\n\n[Footnote b: See chap. VI, entitled \"Judicial Power in the United\nStates.\" This chapter explains the general principles of the American\ntheory of judicial institutions. See also the Federal Constitution, Art.\n3.

See Story, pp. 134,\n162, 489, 511, 581, 668; and the organic law of September 24, 1789, in\nthe \"Collection of the Laws of the United States,\" by Story, vol. i. p.\n53.]\n\nPolitical importance of the judiciary in the United States--Difficulty\nof treating this subject--Utility of judicial power in\nconfederations--What tribunals could be introduced into the\nUnion--Necessity of establishing federal courts of justice--Organization\nof the national judiciary--The Supreme Court--In what it differs from\nall known tribunals.\n\nI have inquired into the legislative and executive power of the Union,\nand the judicial power now remains to be examined; but in this place\nI cannot conceal my fears from the reader. Their judicial institutions\nexercise a great influence on the condition of the Anglo-Americans, and\nthey occupy a prominent place amongst what are probably called political\ninstitutions: in this respect they are peculiarly deserving of our\nattention. But I am at a loss to explain the political action of the\nAmerican tribunals without entering into some technical details of\ntheir constitution and their forms of proceeding; and I know not how to\ndescend to these minutiae without wearying the curiosity of the reader\nby the natural aridity of the subject, or without risking to fall into\nobscurity through a desire to be succinct. I can scarcely hope to escape\nthese various evils; for if I appear too lengthy to a man of the world,\na lawyer may on the other hand complain of my brevity. But these are the\nnatural disadvantages of my subject, and more especially of the point\nwhich I am about to discuss.\n\nThe great difficulty was, not to devise the Constitution to the Federal\nGovernment, but to find out a method of enforcing its laws. Governments\nhave in general but two means of overcoming the opposition of the people\nthey govern, viz., the physical force which is at their own disposal,\nand the moral force which they derive from the decisions of the courts\nof justice.\n\nA government which should have no other means of exacting obedience than\nopen war must be very near its ruin, for one of two alternatives would\nthen probably occur: if its authority was small and its character\ntemperate, it would not resort to violence till the last extremity,\nand it would connive at a number of partial acts of insubordination,\nin which case the State would gradually fall into anarchy; if it was\nenterprising and powerful, it would perpetually have recourse to\nits physical strength, and would speedily degenerate into a military\ndespotism. So that its activity would not be less prejudicial to the\ncommunity than its inaction.\n\nThe great end of justice is to substitute the notion of right for that\nof violence, and to place a legal barrier between the power of the\ngovernment and the use of physical force. The authority which is awarded\nto the intervention of a court of justice by the general opinion of\nmankind is so surprisingly great that it clings to the mere formalities\nof justice, and gives a bodily influence to the shadow of the law. The\nmoral force which courts of justice possess renders the introduction of\nphysical force exceedingly rare, and is very frequently substituted for\nit; but if the latter proves to be indispensable, its power is doubled\nby the association of the idea of law.\n\nA federal government stands in greater need of the support of judicial\ninstitutions than any other, because it is naturally weak and exposed\nto formidable opposition. *c If it were always obliged to resort to\nviolence in the first instance, it could not fulfil its task. The Union,\ntherefore, required a national judiciary to enforce the obedience of the\ncitizens to the laws, and to repeal the attacks which might be directed\nagainst them. The question then remained as to what tribunals were to\nexercise these privileges; were they to be entrusted to the courts of\njustice which were already organized in every State? or was it necessary\nto create federal courts? It may easily be proved that the Union could\nnot adapt the judicial power of the States to its wants. The separation\nof the judiciary from the administrative power of the State no doubt\naffects the security of every citizen and the liberty of all. But it\nis no less important to the existence of the nation that these several\npowers should have the same origin, should follow the same principles,\nand act in the same sphere; in a word, that they should be correlative\nand homogeneous. No one, I presume, ever suggested the advantage of\ntrying offences committed in France by a foreign court of justice, in\norder to secure the impartiality of the judges. The Americans form one\npeople in relation to their Federal Government; but in the bosom of this\npeople divers political bodies have been allowed to subsist which are\ndependent on the national Government in a few points, and independent\nin all the rest; which have all a distinct origin, maxims peculiar to\nthemselves, and special means of carrying on their affairs. To entrust\nthe execution of the laws of the Union to tribunals instituted by these\npolitical bodies would be to allow foreign judges to preside over the\nnation. Nay, more; not only is each State foreign to the Union at\nlarge, but it is in perpetual opposition to the common interests, since\nwhatever authority the Union loses turns to the advantage of the States.\nThus to enforce the laws of the Union by means of the tribunals of the\nStates would be to allow not only foreign but partial judges to preside\nover the nation.\n\n[Footnote c: Federal laws are those which most require courts of\njustice, and those at the same time which have most rarely established\nthem. The reason is that confederations have usually been formed by\nindependent States, which entertained no real intention of obeying the\ncentral Government, and which very readily ceded the right of command\nto the federal executive, and very prudently reserved the right of\nnon-compliance to themselves.]\n\nBut the number, still more than the mere character, of the tribunals of\nthe States rendered them unfit for the service of the nation. When the\nFederal Constitution was formed there were already thirteen courts of\njustice in the United States which decided causes without appeal. That\nnumber is now increased to twenty-four. To suppose that a State can\nsubsist when its fundamental laws may be subjected to four-and-twenty\ndifferent interpretations at the same time is to advance a proposition\nalike contrary to reason and to experience.\n\nThe American legislators therefore agreed to create a federal judiciary\npower to apply the laws of the Union, and to determine certain questions\naffecting general interests, which were carefully determined beforehand.\nThe entire judicial power of the Union was centred in one tribunal,\nwhich was denominated the Supreme Court of the United States. But, to\nfacilitate the expedition of business, inferior courts were appended to\nit, which were empowered to decide causes of small importance without\nappeal, and with appeal causes of more magnitude. The members of the\nSupreme Court are named neither by the people nor the legislature, but\nby the President of the United States, acting with the advice of the\nSenate. In order to render them independent of the other authorities,\ntheir office was made inalienable; and it was determined that their\nsalary, when once fixed, should not be altered by the legislature. *d\nIt was easy to proclaim the principle of a Federal judiciary, but\ndifficulties multiplied when the extent of its jurisdiction was to be\ndetermined.\n\n[Footnote d: The Union was divided into districts, in each of which a\nresident Federal judge was appointed, and the court in which he presided\nwas termed a \"District Court.\" Each of the judges of the Supreme Court\nannually visits a certain portion of the Republic, in order to try the\nmost important causes upon the spot; the court presided over by this\nmagistrate is styled a \"Circuit Court.\" Lastly, all the most serious\ncases of litigation are brought before the Supreme Court, which holds\na solemn session once a year, at which all the judges of the Circuit\nCourts must attend. The jury was introduced into the Federal Courts\nin the same manner, and in the same cases, as into the courts of the\nStates.\n\nIt will be observed that no analogy exists between the Supreme Court\nof the United States and the French Cour de Cassation, since the latter\nonly hears appeals on questions of law. The Supreme Court decides upon\nthe evidence of the fact as well as upon the law of the case, whereas\nthe Cour de Cassation does not pronounce a decision of its own, but\nrefers the cause to the arbitration of another tribunal. See the law of\nSeptember 24, 1789, \"Laws of the United States,\" by Story, vol. i. p.\n53.]\n\nMeans Of Determining The Jurisdiction Of The Federal Courts Difficulty\nof determining the jurisdiction of separate courts of justice in\nconfederations--The courts of the Union obtained the right of fixing\ntheir own jurisdiction--In what respect this rule attacks the portion\nof sovereignty reserved to the several States--The sovereignty of\nthese States restricted by the laws, and the interpretation of the\nlaws--Consequently, the danger of the several States is more apparent\nthan real.\n\nAs the Constitution of the United States recognized two distinct powers\nin presence of each other, represented in a judicial point of view by\ntwo distinct classes of courts of justice, the utmost care which could\nbe taken in defining their separate jurisdictions would have been\ninsufficient to prevent frequent collisions between those tribunals. The\nquestion then arose to whom the right of deciding the competency of each\ncourt was to be referred.\n\nIn nations which constitute a single body politic, when a question is\ndebated between two courts relating to their mutual jurisdiction, a\nthird tribunal is generally within reach to decide the difference;\nand this is effected without difficulty, because in these nations the\nquestions of judicial competency have no connection with the privileges\nof the national supremacy. But it was impossible to create an arbiter\nbetween a superior court of the Union and the superior court of a\nseparate State which would not belong to one of these two classes. It\nwas, therefore, necessary to allow one of these courts to judge its\nown cause, and to take or to retain cognizance of the point which was\ncontested. To grant this privilege to the different courts of the States\nwould have been to destroy the sovereignty of the Union de facto\nafter having established it de jure; for the interpretation of the\nConstitution would soon have restored that portion of independence to\nthe States of which the terms of that act deprived them. The object\nof the creation of a Federal tribunal was to prevent the courts of the\nStates from deciding questions affecting the national interests in their\nown department, and so to form a uniform body of jurisprudene for the\ninterpretation of the laws of the Union. This end would not have been\naccomplished if the courts of the several States had been competent\nto decide upon cases in their separate capacities from which they were\nobliged to abstain as Federal tribunals. The Supreme Court of the\nUnited States was therefore invested with the right of determining all\nquestions of jurisdiction. *e\n\n[Footnote e: In order to diminish the number of these suits, it was\ndecided that in a great many Federal causes the courts of the States\nshould be empowered to decide conjointly with those of the Union, the\nlosing party having then a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States. The Supreme Court of Virginia contested the right of\nthe Supreme Court of the United States to judge an appeal from its\ndecisions, but unsuccessfully. See \"Kent's Commentaries,\" vol. i. p.\n300, pp. 370 et seq.; Story's \"Commentaries,\" p. 646; and \"The Organic\nLaw of the United States,\" vol. i. p. 35.]\n\nThis was a severe blow upon the independence of the States, which was\nthus restricted not only by the laws, but by the interpretation of them;\nby one limit which was known, and by another which was dubious; by a\nrule which was certain, and a rule which was arbitrary. It is true the\nConstitution had laid down the precise limits of the Federal supremacy,\nbut whenever this supremacy is contested by one of the States, a Federal\ntribunal decides the question. Nevertheless, the dangers with which the\nindependence of the States was threatened by this mode of proceeding are\nless serious than they appeared to be. We shall see hereafter that in\nAmerica the real strength of the country is vested in the provincial far\nmore than in the Federal Government. The Federal judges are conscious of\nthe relative weakness of the power in whose name they act, and they are\nmore inclined to abandon a right of jurisdiction in cases where it is\njustly their own than to assert a privilege to which they have no legal\nclaim.\n\nDifferent Cases Of Jurisdiction\n\nThe matter and the party are the first conditions of the Federal\njurisdiction--Suits in which ambassadors are engaged--Suits of the\nUnion--Of a separate State--By whom tried--Causes resulting from the\nlaws of the Union--Why judged by the Federal tribunals--Causes relating\nto the performance of contracts tried by the Federal courts--Consequence\nof this arrangement.\n\nAfter having appointed the means of fixing the competency of the Federal\ncourts, the legislators of the Union defined the cases which should come\nwithin their jurisdiction. It was established, on the one hand, that\ncertain parties must always be brought before the Federal courts,\nwithout any regard to the special nature of the cause; and, on the\nother, that certain causes must always be brought before the same\ncourts, without any regard to the quality of the parties in the suit.\nThese distinctions were therefore admitted to be the basis of the\nFederal jurisdiction.\n\nAmbassadors are the representatives of nations in a state of amity\nwith the Union, and whatever concerns these personages concerns in some\ndegree the whole Union. When an ambassador is a party in a suit, that\nsuit affects the welfare of the nation, and a Federal tribunal is\nnaturally called upon to decide it.\n\nThe Union itself may be invoked in legal proceedings, and in this case\nit would be alike contrary to the customs of all nations and to common\nsense to appeal to a tribunal representing any other sovereignty\nthan its own; the Federal courts, therefore, take cognizance of these\naffairs.\n\nWhen two parties belonging to two different States are engaged in a\nsuit, the case cannot with propriety be brought before a court of either\nState. The surest expedient is to select a tribunal like that of the\nUnion, which can excite the suspicions of neither party, and which\noffers the most natural as well as the most certain remedy.\n\nWhen the two parties are not private individuals, but States, an\nimportant political consideration is added to the same motive of equity.\nThe quality of the parties in this case gives a national importance to\nall their disputes; and the most trifling litigation of the States may\nbe said to involve the peace of the whole Union. *f\n\n[Footnote f: The Constitution also says that the Federal courts shall\ndecide \"controversies between a State and the citizens of another\nState.\" And here a most important question of a constitutional nature\narose, which was, whether the jurisdiction given by the Constitution in\ncases in which a State is a party extended to suits brought against a\nState as well as by it, or was exclusively confined to the latter. The\nquestion was most elaborately considered in the case of Chisholm v.\nGeorgia, and was decided by the majority of the Supreme Court in the\naffirmative. The decision created general alarm among the States, and\nan amendment was proposed and ratified by which the power was entirely\ntaken away, so far as it regards suits brought against a State. See\nStory's \"Commentaries,\" p. 624, or in the large edition Section 1677.]\n\n\nThe nature of the cause frequently prescribes the rule of competency.\nThus all the questions which concern maritime commerce evidently fall\nunder the cognizance of the Federal tribunals. *g Almost all these\nquestions are connected with the interpretation of the law of nations,\nand in this respect they essentially interest the Union in relation to\nforeign powers. Moreover, as the sea is not included within the limits\nof any peculiar jurisdiction, the national courts can only hear causes\nwhich originate in maritime affairs.\n\n[Footnote g: As for instance, all cases of piracy.]\n\nThe Constitution comprises under one head almost all the cases which by\ntheir very nature come within the limits of the Federal courts. The\nrule which it lays down is simple, but pregnant with an entire system of\nideas, and with a vast multitude of facts. It declares that the judicial\npower of the Supreme Court shall extend to all cases in law and equity\narising under the laws of the United States.\n\nTwo examples will put the intention of the legislator in the clearest\nlight:\n\nThe Constitution prohibits the States from making laws on the value\nand circulation of money: If, notwithstanding this prohibition, a State\npasses a law of this kind, with which the interested parties refuse to\ncomply because it is contrary to the Constitution, the case must come\nbefore a Federal court, because it arises under the laws of the United\nStates. Again, if difficulties arise in the levying of import duties\nwhich have been voted by Congress, the Federal court must decide the\ncase, because it arises under the interpretation of a law of the United\nStates.\n\nThis rule is in perfect accordance with the fundamental principles of\nthe Federal Constitution. The Union, as it was established in 1789,\npossesses, it is true, a limited supremacy; but it was intended that\nwithin its limits it should form one and the same people. *h Within\nthose limits the Union is sovereign. When this point is established\nand admitted, the inference is easy; for if it be acknowledged that\nthe United States constitute one and the same people within the bounds\nprescribed by their Constitution, it is impossible to refuse them the\nrights which belong to other nations. But it has been allowed, from the\norigin of society, that every nation has the right of deciding by its\nown courts those questions which concern the execution of its own laws.\nTo this it is answered that the Union is in so singular a position\nthat in relation to some matters it constitutes a people, and that in\nrelation to all the rest it is a nonentity. But the inference to be\ndrawn is, that in the laws relating to these matters the Union possesses\nall the rights of absolute sovereignty. The difficulty is to know what\nthese matters are; and when once it is resolved (and we have shown\nhow it was resolved, in speaking of the means of determining the\njurisdiction of the Federal courts) no further doubt can arise; for as\nsoon as it is established that a suit is Federal--that is to say, that\nit belongs to the share of sovereignty reserved by the Constitution of\nthe Union--the natural consequence is that it should come within the\njurisdiction of a Federal court.\n\n[Footnote h: This principle was in some measure restricted by the\nintroduction of the several States as independent powers into the\nSenate, and by allowing them to vote separately in the House of\nRepresentatives when the President is elected by that body. But these\nare exceptions, and the contrary principle is the rule.]\n\nWhenever the laws of the United States are attacked, or whenever they\nare resorted to in self-defence, the Federal courts must be appealed to.\nThus the jurisdiction of the tribunals of the Union extends and narrows\nits limits exactly in the same ratio as the sovereignty of the Union\naugments or decreases. We have shown that the principal aim of the\nlegislators of 1789 was to divide the sovereign authority into two\nparts. In the one they placed the control of all the general interests\nof the Union, in the other the control of the special interests of\nits component States. Their chief solicitude was to arm the Federal\nGovernment with sufficient power to enable it to resist, within\nits sphere, the encroachments of the several States. As for these\ncommunities, the principle of independence within certain limits of\ntheir own was adopted in their behalf; and they were concealed from the\ninspection, and protected from the control, of the central Government.\nIn speaking of the division of authority, I observed that this latter\nprinciple had not always been held sacred, since the States are\nprevented from passing certain laws which apparently belong to their own\nparticular sphere of interest. When a State of the Union passes a law of\nthis kind, the citizens who are injured by its execution can appeal to\nthe Federal courts.\n\nThus the jurisdiction of the Federal courts extends not only to all the\ncases which arise under the laws of the Union, but also to those\nwhich arise under laws made by the several States in opposition to the\nConstitution. The States are prohibited from making ex post facto laws\nin criminal cases, and any person condemned by virtue of a law of this\nkind can appeal to the judicial power of the Union. The States are\nlikewise prohibited from making laws which may have a tendency to impair\nthe obligations of contracts. *i If a citizen thinks that an obligation\nof this kind is impaired by a law passed in his State, he may refuse to\nobey it, and may appeal to the Federal courts. *j\n\n[Footnote i: It is perfectly clear, says Mr. Story (\"Commentaries,\" p.\n503, or in the large edition Section 1379), that any law which enlarges,\nabridges, or in any manner changes the intention of the parties,\nresulting from the stipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it.\nHe gives in the same place a very long and careful definition of what is\nunderstood by a contract in Federal jurisprudence. A grant made by the\nState to a private individual, and accepted by him, is a contract, and\ncannot be revoked by any future law. A charter granted by the State to\na company is a contract, and equally binding to the State as to the\ngrantee. The clause of the Constitution here referred to insures,\ntherefore, the existence of a great part of acquired rights, but not of\nall. Property may legally be held, though it may not have passed into\nthe possessor's hands by means of a contract; and its possession is an\nacquired right, not guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.]\n\n[Footnote j: A remarkable instance of this is given by Mr. Story (p.\n508, or in the large edition Section 1388): \"Dartmouth College in New\nHampshire had been founded by a charter granted to certain individuals\nbefore the American Revolution, and its trustees formed a corporation\nunder this charter. The legislature of New Hampshire had, without the\nconsent of this corporation, passed an act changing the organization of\nthe original provincial charter of the college, and transferring all the\nrights, privileges, and franchises from the old charter trustees to new\ntrustees appointed under the act. The constitutionality of the act was\ncontested, and, after solemn arguments, it was deliberately held by\nthe Supreme Court that the provincial charter was a contract within\nthe meaning of the Constitution (Art. I. Section 10), and that the\nemendatory act was utterly void, as impairing the obligation of\nthat charter. The college was deemed, like other colleges of private\nfoundation, to be a private eleemosynary institution, endowed by\nits charter with a capacity to take property unconnected with the\nGovernment. Its funds were bestowed upon the faith of the charter, and\nthose funds consisted entirely of private donations. It is true that the\nuses were in some sense public, that is, for the general benefit, and\nnot for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make\nthe corporation a public corporation. It was a private institution for\ngeneral charity. It was not distinguishable in principle from a private\ndonation, vested in private trustees, for a public charity, or for\na particular purpose of beneficence. And the State itself, if it had\nbestowed funds upon a charity of the same nature, could not resume those\nfunds.\"]\n\nThis provision appears to me to be the most serious attack upon the\nindependence of the States. The rights awarded to the Federal Government\nfor purposes of obvious national importance are definite and easily\ncomprehensible; but those with which this last clause invests it are\nnot either clearly appreciable or accurately defined. For there are vast\nnumbers of political laws which influence the existence of obligations\nof contracts, which may thus furnish an easy pretext for the aggressions\nof the central authority.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part IV\n\nProcedure Of The Federal Courts\n\nNatural weakness of the judiciary power in confederations--Legislators\nought to strive as much as possible to bring private individuals, and\nnot States, before the Federal Courts--How the Americans have succeeded\nin this--Direct prosecution of private individuals in the Federal\nCourts--Indirect prosecution of the States which violate the laws of the\nUnion--The decrees of the Supreme Court enervate but do not destroy the\nprovincial laws.\n\nI have shown what the privileges of the Federal courts are, and it is no\nless important to point out the manner in which they are exercised. The\nirresistible authority of justice in countries in which the sovereignty\nin undivided is derived from the fact that the tribunals of those\ncountries represent the entire nation at issue with the individual\nagainst whom their decree is directed, and the idea of power is thus\nintroduced to corroborate the idea of right. But this is not always\nthe case in countries in which the sovereignty is divided; in them the\njudicial power is more frequently opposed to a fraction of the nation\nthan to an isolated individual, and its moral authority and physical\nstrength are consequently diminished. In federal States the power of\nthe judge is naturally decreased, and that of the justiciable parties\nis augmented. The aim of the legislator in confederate States ought\ntherefore to be to render the position of the courts of justice\nanalogous to that which they occupy in countries where the sovereignty\nis undivided; in other words, his efforts ought constantly to tend to\nmaintain the judicial power of the confederation as the representative\nof the nation, and the justiciable party as the representative of an\nindividual interest.\n\nEvery government, whatever may be its constitution, requires the means\nof constraining its subjects to discharge their obligations, and of\nprotecting its privileges from their assaults. As far as the direct\naction of the Government on the community is concerned, the Constitution\nof the United States contrived, by a master-stroke of policy, that\nthe federal courts, acting in the name of the laws, should only take\ncognizance of parties in an individual capacity. For, as it had been\ndeclared that the Union consisted of one and the same people within\nthe limits laid down by the Constitution, the inference was that the\nGovernment created by this Constitution, and acting within these limits,\nwas invested with all the privileges of a national government, one of\nthe principal of which is the right of transmitting its injunctions\ndirectly to the private citizen. When, for instance, the Union votes an\nimpost, it does not apply to the States for the levying of it, but to\nevery American citizen in proportion to his assessment. The Supreme\nCourt, which is empowered to enforce the execution of this law of the\nUnion, exerts its influence not upon a refractory State, but upon the\nprivate taxpayer; and, like the judicial power of other nations, it is\nopposed to the person of an individual. It is to be observed that the\nUnion chose its own antagonist; and as that antagonist is feeble, he is\nnaturally worsted.\n\n\nBut the difficulty increases when the proceedings are not brought\nforward by but against the Union. The Constitution recognizes the\nlegislative power of the States; and a law so enacted may impair the\nprivileges of the Union, in which case a collision in unavoidable\nbetween that body and the State which has passed the law: and it only\nremains to select the least dangerous remedy, which is very clearly\ndeducible from the general principles I have before established. *k\n\n[Footnote k: See Chapter VI. on \"Judicial Power in America.\"]\n\nIt may be conceived that, in the case under consideration, the Union\nmight have used the State before a Federal court, which would have\nannulled the act, and by this means it would have adopted a natural\ncourse of proceeding; but the judicial power would have been placed\nin open hostility to the State, and it was desirable to avoid this\npredicament as much as possible. The Americans hold that it is nearly\nimpossible that a new law should not impair the interests of some\nprivate individual by its provisions: these private interests are\nassumed by the American legislators as the ground of attack against such\nmeasures as may be prejudicial to the Union, and it is to these cases\nthat the protection of the Supreme Court is extended.\n\nSuppose a State vends a certain portion of its territory to a company,\nand that a year afterwards it passes a law by which the territory\nis otherwise disposed of, and that clause of the Constitution which\nprohibits laws impairing the obligation of contracts violated. When the\npurchaser under the second act appears to take possession, the possessor\nunder the first act brings his action before the tribunals of the Union,\nand causes the title of the claimant to be pronounced null and void. *l\nThus, in point of fact, the judicial power of the Union is contesting\nthe claims of the sovereignty of a State; but it only acts indirectly\nand upon a special application of detail: it attacks the law in its\nconsequences, not in its principle, and it rather weakens than destroys\nit.\n\n[Footnote l: See Kent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. i. p. 387.]\n\nThe last hypothesis that remained was that each State formed a\ncorporation enjoying a separate existence and distinct civil rights, and\nthat it could therefore sue or be sued before a tribunal. Thus a State\ncould bring an action against another State. In this instance the Union\nwas not called upon to contest a provincial law, but to try a suit in\nwhich a State was a party. This suit was perfectly similar to any other\ncause, except that the quality of the parties was different; and here\nthe danger pointed out at the beginning of this chapter exists with less\nchance of being avoided. The inherent disadvantage of the very essence\nof Federal constitutions is that they engender parties in the bosom\nof the nation which present powerful obstacles to the free course of\njustice.\n\nHigh Rank Of The Supreme Court Amongst The Great Powers Of State\nNo nation ever constituted so great a judicial power as the\nAmericans--Extent of its prerogative--Its political influence--The\ntranquillity and the very existence of the Union depend on the\ndiscretion of the seven Federal Judges.\n\nWhen we have successively examined in detail the organization of the\nSupreme Court, and the entire prerogatives which it exercises, we shall\nreadily admit that a more imposing judicial power was never constituted\nby any people. The Supreme Court is placed at the head of all known\ntribunals, both by the nature of its rights and the class of justiciable\nparties which it controls.\n\nIn all the civilized countries of Europe the Government has always shown\nthe greatest repugnance to allow the cases to which it was itself a\nparty to be decided by the ordinary course of justice. This repugnance\nnaturally attains its utmost height in an absolute Government; and, on\nthe other hand, the privileges of the courts of justice are extended\nwith the increasing liberties of the people: but no European nation has\nat present held that all judicial controversies, without regard to their\norigin, can be decided by the judges of common law.\n\nIn America this theory has been actually put in practice, and the\nSupreme Court of the United States is the sole tribunal of the nation.\nIts power extends to all the cases arising under laws and treaties made\nby the executive and legislative authorities, to all cases of admiralty\nand maritime jurisdiction, and in general to all points which affect the\nlaw of nations. It may even be affirmed that, although its constitution\nis essentially judicial, its prerogatives are almost entirely political.\nIts sole object is to enforce the execution of the laws of the Union;\nand the Union only regulates the relations of the Government with\nthe citizens, and of the nation with Foreign Powers: the relations of\ncitizens amongst themselves are almost exclusively regulated by the\nsovereignty of the States.\n\nA second and still greater cause of the preponderance of this court\nmay be adduced. In the nations of Europe the courts of justice are only\ncalled upon to try the controversies of private individuals; but the\nSupreme Court of the United States summons sovereign powers to its bar.\nWhen the clerk of the court advances on the steps of the tribunal, and\nsimply says, \"The State of New York versus the State of Ohio,\" it is\nimpossible not to feel that the Court which he addresses is no ordinary\nbody; and when it is recollected that one of these parties represents\none million, and the other two millions of men, one is struck by the\nresponsibility of the seven judges whose decision is about to satisfy or\nto disappoint so large a number of their fellow-citizens.\n\nThe peace, the prosperity, and the very existence of the Union\nare vested in the hands of the seven judges. Without their active\nco-operation the Constitution would be a dead letter: the Executive\nappeals to them for assistance against the encroachments of the\nlegislative powers; the Legislature demands their protection from the\ndesigns of the Executive; they defend the Union from the disobedience\nof the States, the States from the exaggerated claims of the Union,\nthe public interest against the interests of private citizens, and\nthe conservative spirit of order against the fleeting innovations of\ndemocracy. Their power is enormous, but it is clothed in the authority\nof public opinion. They are the all-powerful guardians of a people which\nrespects law, but they would be impotent against popular neglect or\npopular contempt. The force of public opinion is the most intractable of\nagents, because its exact limits cannot be defined; and it is not less\ndangerous to exceed than to remain below the boundary prescribed.\n\nThe Federal judges must not only be good citizens, and men possessed of\nthat information and integrity which are indispensable to magistrates,\nbut they must be statesmen--politicians, not unread in the signs of the\ntimes, not afraid to brave the obstacles which can be subdued, nor slow\nto turn aside such encroaching elements as may threaten the supremacy of\nthe Union and the obedience which is due to the laws.\n\nThe President, who exercises a limited power, may err without causing\ngreat mischief in the State. Congress may decide amiss without\ndestroying the Union, because the electoral body in which Congress\noriginates may cause it to retract its decision by changing its members.\nBut if the Supreme Court is ever composed of imprudent men or bad\ncitizens, the Union may be plunged into anarchy or civil war.\n\nThe real cause of this danger, however, does not lie in the constitution\nof the tribunal, but in the very nature of Federal Governments. We\nhave observed that in confederate peoples it is especially necessary to\nconsolidate the judicial authority, because in no other nations do those\nindependent persons who are able to cope with the social body exist in\ngreater power or in a better condition to resist the physical strength\nof the Government. But the more a power requires to be strengthened, the\nmore extensive and independent it must be made; and the dangers\nwhich its abuse may create are heightened by its independence and its\nstrength. The source of the evil is not, therefore, in the constitution\nof the power, but in the constitution of those States which render its\nexistence necessary.\n\nIn What Respects The Federal Constitution Is Superior To That Of The\nStates\n\nIn what respects the Constitution of the Union can be compared to that\nof the States--Superiority of the Constitution of the Union attributable\nto the wisdom of the Federal legislators--Legislature of the Union less\ndependent on the people than that of the States--Executive power\nmore independent in its sphere--Judicial power less subjected to the\ninclinations of the majority--Practical consequence of these facts--The\ndangers inherent in a democratic government eluded by the Federal\nlegislators, and increased by the legislators of the States.\n\nThe Federal Constitution differs essentially from that of the States in\nthe ends which it is intended to accomplish, but in the means by which\nthese ends are promoted a greater analogy exists between them. The\nobjects of the Governments are different, but their forms are the same;\nand in this special point of view there is some advantage in comparing\nthem together.\n\nI am of opinion that the Federal Constitution is superior to all the\nConstitutions of the States, for several reasons.\n\nThe present Constitution of the Union was formed at a later period\nthan those of the majority of the States, and it may have derived some\nameliorations from past experience. But we shall be led to acknowledge\nthat this is only a secondary cause of its superiority, when we\nrecollect that eleven new States *n have been added to the American\nConfederation since the promulgation of the Federal Constitution, and\nthat these new republics have always rather exaggerated than avoided the\ndefects which existed in the former Constitutions.\n\n[Footnote n: [The number of States has now risen to 46 (1874), besides\nthe District of Columbia.]]\n\nThe chief cause of the superiority of the Federal Constitution lay in\nthe character of the legislators who composed it. At the time when it\nwas formed the dangers of the Confederation were imminent, and its ruin\nseemed inevitable. In this extremity the people chose the men who most\ndeserved the esteem, rather than those who had gained the affections,\nof the country. I have already observed that distinguished as almost\nall the legislators of the Union were for their intelligence, they were\nstill more so for their patriotism. They had all been nurtured at a time\nwhen the spirit of liberty was braced by a continual struggle against\na powerful and predominant authority. When the contest was terminated,\nwhilst the excited passions of the populace persisted in warring with\ndangers which had ceased to threaten them, these men stopped short in\ntheir career; they cast a calmer and more penetrating look upon\nthe country which was now their own; they perceived that the war of\nindependence was definitely ended, and that the only dangers which\nAmerica had to fear were those which might result from the abuse of the\nfreedom she had won. They had the courage to say what they believed\nto be true, because they were animated by a warm and sincere love of\nliberty; and they ventured to propose restrictions, because they were\nresolutely opposed to destruction. *o\n\n[Footnote o: At this time Alexander Hamilton, who was one of the\nprincipal founders of the Constitution, ventured to express the\nfollowing sentiments in \"The Federalist,\" No. 71:--\n\n\n\"There are some who would be inclined to regard the servile pliancy of\nthe Executive to a prevailing current, either in the community or in\nthe Legislature, as its best recommendation. But such men entertain\nvery crude notions, as well of the purposes for which government was\ninstituted as of the true means by which the public happiness may be\npromoted. The Republican principle demands that the deliberative sense\nof the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust\nthe management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified\ncomplaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient\nimpulse which the people may receive from the arts of men who flatter\ntheir prejudices to betray their interests. It is a just observation,\nthat the people commonly intend the public good. This often applies to\ntheir very errors. But their good sense would despise the adulator\nwho should pretend that they always reason right about the means of\npromoting it. They know from experience that they sometimes err; and the\nwonder is that they so seldom err as they do, beset, as they continually\nare, by the wiles of parasites and sycophants; by the snares of the\nambitious, the avaricious, the desperate; by the artifices of men who\npossess their confidence more than they deserve it, and of those who\nseek to possess rather than to deserve it. When occasions present\nthemselves in which the interests of the people are at variance with\ntheir inclinations, it is the duty of persons whom they have appointed\nto be the guardians of those interests to withstand the temporary\ndelusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and\nsedate reflection. Instances might be cited in which a conduct of this\nkind has saved the people from very fatal consequences of their own\nmistakes, and has procured lasting monuments of their gratitude to the\nmen who had courage and magnanimity enough to serve them at the peril of\ntheir displeasure.\"]\n\nThe greater number of the Constitutions of the States assign one year\nfor the duration of the House of Representatives, and two years for that\nof the Senate; so that members of the legislative body are constantly\nand narrowly tied down by the slightest desires of their constituents.\nThe legislators of the Union were of opinion that this excessive\ndependence of the Legislature tended to alter the nature of the main\nconsequences of the representative system, since it vested the source,\nnot only of authority, but of government, in the people. They increased\nthe length of the time for which the representatives were returned, in\norder to give them freer scope for the exercise of their own judgment.\n\nThe Federal Constitution, as well as the Constitutions of the different\nStates, divided the legislative body into two branches. But in the\nStates these two branches were composed of the same elements, and\nelected in the same manner. The consequence was that the passions\nand inclinations of the populace were as rapidly and as energetically\nrepresented in one chamber as in the other, and that laws were made with\nall the characteristics of violence and precipitation. By the Federal\nConstitution the two houses originate in like manner in the choice of\nthe people; but the conditions of eligibility and the mode of election\nwere changed, to the end that, if, as is the case in certain nations,\none branch of the Legislature represents the same interests as the\nother, it may at least represent a superior degree of intelligence\nand discretion. A mature age was made one of the conditions of the\nsenatorial dignity, and the Upper House was chosen by an elected\nassembly of a limited number of members.\n\nTo concentrate the whole social force in the hands of the legislative\nbody is the natural tendency of democracies; for as this is the\npower which emanates the most directly from the people, it is made to\nparticipate most fully in the preponderating authority of the multitude,\nand it is naturally led to monopolize every species of influence. This\nconcentration is at once prejudicial to a well-conducted administration,\nand favorable to the despotism of the majority. The legislators of the\nStates frequently yielded to these democratic propensities, which were\ninvariably and courageously resisted by the founders of the Union.\n\nIn the States the executive power is vested in the hands of a\nmagistrate, who is apparently placed upon a level with the Legislature,\nbut who is in reality nothing more than the blind agent and the passive\ninstrument of its decisions. He can derive no influence from the\nduration of his functions, which terminate with the revolving year, or\nfrom the exercise of prerogatives which can scarcely be said to exist.\nThe Legislature can condemn him to inaction by intrusting the execution\nof the laws to special committees of its own members, and can annul\nhis temporary dignity by depriving him of his salary. The Federal\nConstitution vests all the privileges and all the responsibility of the\nexecutive power in a single individual. The duration of the Presidency\nis fixed at four years; the salary of the individual who fills that\noffice cannot be altered during the term of his functions; he is\nprotected by a body of official dependents, and armed with a suspensive\nveto. In short, every effort was made to confer a strong and independent\nposition upon the executive authority within the limits which had been\nprescribed to it.\n\nIn the Constitutions of all the States the judicial power is that which\nremains the most independent of the legislative authority; nevertheless,\nin all the States the Legislature has reserved to itself the right of\nregulating the emoluments of the judges, a practice which necessarily\nsubjects these magistrates to its immediate influence. In some States\nthe judges are only temporarily appointed, which deprives them of\na great portion of their power and their freedom. In others the\nlegislative and judicial powers are entirely confounded; thus the Senate\nof New York, for instance, constitutes in certain cases the Superior\nCourt of the State. The Federal Constitution, on the other hand,\ncarefully separates the judicial authority from all external influences;\nand it provides for the independence of the judges, by declaring that\ntheir salary shall not be altered, and that their functions shall be\ninalienable.\n\nThe practical consequences of these different systems may easily be\nperceived. An attentive observer will soon remark that the business of\nthe Union is incomparably better conducted than that of any individual\nState. The conduct of the Federal Government is more fair and more\ntemperate than that of the States, its designs are more fraught with\nwisdom, its projects are more durable and more skilfully combined, its\nmeasures are put into execution with more vigor and consistency.\n\nI recapitulate the substance of this chapter in a few words: The\nexistence of democracies is threatened by two dangers, viz., the\ncomplete subjection of the legislative body to the caprices of\nthe electoral body, and the concentration of all the powers of the\nGovernment in the legislative authority. The growth of these evils has\nbeen encouraged by the policy of the legislators of the States, but it\nhas been resisted by the legislators of the Union by every means which\nlay within their control.\n\nCharacteristics Which Distinguish The Federal Constitution Of The United\nStates Of America From All Other Federal Constitutions American Union\nappears to resemble all other confederations--Nevertheless its effects\nare different--Reason of this--Distinctions between the Union and all\nother confederations--The American Government not a federal but an\nimperfect national Government.\n\nThe United States of America do not afford either the first or the only\ninstance of confederate States, several of which have existed in modern\nEurope, without adverting to those of antiquity. Switzerland, the\nGermanic Empire, and the Republic of the United Provinces either have\nbeen or still are confederations. In studying the constitutions of these\ndifferent countries, the politician is surprised to observe that the\npowers with which they invested the Federal Government are nearly\nidentical with the privileges awarded by the American Constitution to\nthe Government of the United States. They confer upon the central power\nthe same rights of making peace and war, of raising money and troops,\nand of providing for the general exigencies and the common interests\nof the nation. Nevertheless the Federal Government of these different\npeoples has always been as remarkable for its weakness and inefficiency\nas that of the Union is for its vigorous and enterprising spirit. Again,\nthe first American Confederation perished through the excessive weakness\nof its Government; and this weak Government was, notwithstanding, in\npossession of rights even more extensive than those of the Federal\nGovernment of the present day. But the more recent Constitution of\nthe United States contains certain principles which exercise a most\nimportant influence, although they do not at once strike the observer.\n\nThis Constitution, which may at first sight be confounded with the\nfederal constitutions which preceded it, rests upon a novel theory,\nwhich may be considered as a great invention in modern political\nscience. In all the confederations which had been formed before the\nAmerican Constitution of 1789 the allied States agreed to obey the\ninjunctions of a Federal Government; but they reserved to themselves the\nright of ordaining and enforcing the execution of the laws of the Union.\nThe American States which combined in 1789 agreed that the Federal\nGovernment should not only dictate the laws, but that it should execute\nit own enactments. In both cases the right is the same, but the exercise\nof the right is different; and this alteration produced the most\nmomentous consequences.\n\nIn all the confederations which had been formed before the American\nUnion the Federal Government demanded its supplies at the hands of the\nseparate Governments; and if the measure it prescribed was onerous to\nany one of those bodies means were found to evade its claims: if the\nState was powerful, it had recourse to arms; if it was weak, it connived\nat the resistance which the law of the Union, its sovereign, met with,\nand resorted to inaction under the plea of inability. Under these\ncircumstances one of the two alternatives has invariably occurred;\neither the most preponderant of the allied peoples has assumed the\nprivileges of the Federal authority and ruled all the States in its\nname, *p or the Federal Government has been abandoned by its natural\nsupporters, anarchy has arisen between the confederates, and the Union\nhas lost all powers of action. *q\n\n[Footnote p: This was the case in Greece, when Philip undertook to\nexecute the decree of the Amphictyons; in the Low Countries, where the\nprovince of Holland always gave the law; and, in our own time, in the\nGermanic Confederation, in which Austria and Prussia assume a great\ndegree of influence over the whole country, in the name of the Diet.]\n\n[Footnote q: Such has always been the situation of the Swiss\nConfederation, which would have perished ages ago but for the mutual\njealousies of its neighbors.]\n\nIn America the subjects of the Union are not States, but private\ncitizens: the national Government levies a tax, not upon the State of\nMassachusetts, but upon each inhabitant of Massachusetts. All former\nconfederate governments presided over communities, but that of the Union\nrules individuals; its force is not borrowed, but self-derived; and it\nis served by its own civil and military officers, by its own army, and\nits own courts of justice. It cannot be doubted that the spirit of the\nnation, the passions of the multitude, and the provincial prejudices\nof each State tend singularly to diminish the authority of a Federal\nauthority thus constituted, and to facilitate the means of resistance to\nits mandates; but the comparative weakness of a restricted sovereignty\nis an evil inherent in the Federal system. In America, each State\nhas fewer opportunities of resistance and fewer temptations to\nnon-compliance; nor can such a design be put in execution (if indeed it\nbe entertained) without an open violation of the laws of the Union,\na direct interruption of the ordinary course of justice, and a bold\ndeclaration of revolt; in a word, without taking a decisive step which\nmen hesitate to adopt.\n\nIn all former confederations the privileges of the Union furnished more\nelements of discord than of power, since they multiplied the claims\nof the nation without augmenting the means of enforcing them: and in\naccordance with this fact it may be remarked that the real weakness of\nfederal governments has almost always been in the exact ratio of their\nnominal power. Such is not the case in the American Union, in which,\nas in ordinary governments, the Federal Government has the means of\nenforcing all it is empowered to demand.\n\nThe human understanding more easily invents new things than new words,\nand we are thence constrained to employ a multitude of improper and\ninadequate expressions. When several nations form a permanent league\nand establish a supreme authority, which, although it has not the same\ninfluence over the members of the community as a national government,\nacts upon each of the Confederate States in a body, this Government,\nwhich is so essentially different from all others, is denominated a\nFederal one. Another form of society is afterwards discovered, in which\nseveral peoples are fused into one and the same nation with regard to\ncertain common interests, although they remain distinct, or at least\nonly confederate, with regard to all their other concerns. In this case\nthe central power acts directly upon those whom it governs, whom it\nrules, and whom it judges, in the same manner, as, but in a more limited\ncircle than, a national government. Here the term Federal Government is\nclearly no longer applicable to a state of things which must be styled\nan incomplete national Government: a form of government has been found\nout which is neither exactly national nor federal; but no further\nprogress has been made, and the new word which will one day designate\nthis novel invention does not yet exist.\n\nThe absence of this new species of confederation has been the cause\nwhich has brought all Unions to Civil War, to subjection, or to a\nstagnant apathy, and the peoples which formed these leagues have been\neither too dull to discern, or too pusillanimous to apply this great\nremedy. The American Confederation perished by the same defects.\n\nBut the Confederate States of America had been long accustomed to form\na portion of one empire before they had won their independence; they\nhad not contracted the habit of governing themselves, and their national\nprejudices had not taken deep root in their minds. Superior to the rest\nof the world in political knowledge, and sharing that knowledge equally\namongst themselves, they were little agitated by the passions which\ngenerally oppose the extension of federal authority in a nation, and\nthose passions were checked by the wisdom of the chief citizens. The\nAmericans applied the remedy with prudent firmness as soon as they were\nconscious of the evil; they amended their laws, and they saved their\ncountry.\n\n\n\n\nChapter VIII: The Federal Constitution--Part V\n\nAdvantages Of The Federal System In General, And Its Special Utility In\nAmerica.\n\nHappiness and freedom of small nations--Power of great nations--Great\nempires favorable to the growth of civilization--Strength often the\nfirst element of national prosperity--Aim of the Federal system to\nunite the twofold advantages resulting from a small and from a large\nterritory--Advantages derived by the United States from this system--The\nlaw adapts itself to the exigencies of the population; population does\nnot conform to the exigencies of the law--Activity, amelioration, love\nand enjoyment of freedom in the American communities--Public spirit of\nthe Union the abstract of provincial patriotism--Principles and things\ncirculate freely over the territory of the United States--The Union is\nhappy and free as a little nation, and respected as a great empire.\n\nIn small nations the scrutiny of society penetrates into every part, and\nthe spirit of improvement enters into the most trifling details; as the\nambition of the people is necessarily checked by its weakness, all the\nefforts and resources of the citizens are turned to the internal benefit\nof the community, and are not likely to evaporate in the fleeting\nbreath of glory. The desires of every individual are limited, because\nextraordinary faculties are rarely to be met with. The gifts of an equal\nfortune render the various conditions of life uniform, and the manners\nof the inhabitants are orderly and simple. Thus, if one estimate the\ngradations of popular morality and enlightenment, we shall generally\nfind that in small nations there are more persons in easy circumstances,\na more numerous population, and a more tranquil state of society, than\nin great empires.\n\nWhen tyranny is established in the bosom of a small nation, it is more\ngalling than elsewhere, because, as it acts within a narrow circle,\nevery point of that circle is subject to its direct influence. It\nsupplies the place of those great designs which it cannot entertain by\na violent or an exasperating interference in a multitude of minute\ndetails; and it leaves the political world, to which it properly\nbelongs, to meddle with the arrangements of domestic life. Tastes as\nwell as actions are to be regulated at its pleasure; and the families of\nthe citizens as well as the affairs of the State are to be governed by\nits decisions. This invasion of rights occurs, however, but seldom,\nand freedom is in truth the natural state of small communities. The\ntemptations which the Government offers to ambition are too weak, and\nthe resources of private individuals are too slender, for the sovereign\npower easily to fall within the grasp of a single citizen; and should\nsuch an event have occurred, the subjects of the State can without\ndifficulty overthrow the tyrant and his oppression by a simultaneous\neffort.\n\nSmall nations have therefore ever been the cradle of political liberty;\nand the fact that many of them have lost their immunities by extending\ntheir dominion shows that the freedom they enjoyed was more a\nconsequence of the inferior size than of the character of the people.\n\nThe history of the world affords no instance of a great nation retaining\nthe form of republican government for a long series of years, *r\nand this has led to the conclusion that such a state of things is\nimpracticable. For my own part, I cannot but censure the imprudence of\nattempting to limit the possible and to judge the future on the part of\na being who is hourly deceived by the most palpable realities of life,\nand who is constantly taken by surprise in the circumstances with which\nhe is most familiar. But it may be advanced with confidence that the\nexistence of a great republic will always be exposed to far greater\nperils than that of a small one.\n\n[Footnote r: I do not speak of a confederation of small republics, but\nof a great consolidated Republic.]\n\nAll the passions which are most fatal to republican institutions spread\nwith an increasing territory, whilst the virtues which maintain their\ndignity do not augment in the same proportion. The ambition of the\ncitizens increases with the power of the State; the strength of parties\nwith the importance of the ends they have in view; but that devotion to\nthe common weal which is the surest check on destructive passions is\nnot stronger in a large than in a small republic. It might, indeed, be\nproved without difficulty that it is less powerful and less sincere. The\narrogance of wealth and the dejection of wretchedness, capital cities of\nunwonted extent, a lax morality, a vulgar egotism, and a great confusion\nof interests, are the dangers which almost invariably arise from the\nmagnitude of States. But several of these evils are scarcely prejudicial\nto a monarchy, and some of them contribute to maintain its existence.\nIn monarchical States the strength of the government is its own; it may\nuse, but it does not depend on, the community, and the authority of the\nprince is proportioned to the prosperity of the nation; but the only\nsecurity which a republican government possesses against these evils\nlies in the support of the majority. This support is not, however,\nproportionably greater in a large republic than it is in a small one;\nand thus, whilst the means of attack perpetually increase both in number\nand in influence, the power of resistance remains the same, or it may\nrather be said to diminish, since the propensities and interests of\nthe people are diversified by the increase of the population, and the\ndifficulty of forming a compact majority is constantly augmented. It\nhas been observed, moreover, that the intensity of human passions is\nheightened, not only by the importance of the end which they propose to\nattain, but by the multitude of individuals who are animated by them at\nthe same time. Every one has had occasion to remark that his emotions\nin the midst of a sympathizing crowd are far greater than those which he\nwould have felt in solitude. In great republics the impetus of political\npassion is irresistible, not only because it aims at gigantic purposes,\nbut because it is felt and shared by millions of men at the same time.\n\nIt may therefore be asserted as a general proposition that nothing is\nmore opposed to the well-being and the freedom of man than vast empires.\nNevertheless it is important to acknowledge the peculiar advantages of\ngreat States. For the very reason which renders the desire of power\nmore intense in these communities than amongst ordinary men, the love of\nglory is also more prominent in the hearts of a class of citizens,\nwho regard the applause of a great people as a reward worthy of their\nexertions, and an elevating encouragement to man. If we would learn why\nit is that great nations contribute more powerfully to the spread of\nhuman improvement than small States, we shall discover an adequate cause\nin the rapid and energetic circulation of ideas, and in those great\ncities which are the intellectual centres where all the rays of human\ngenius are reflected and combined. To this it may be added that most\nimportant discoveries demand a display of national power which the\nGovernment of a small State is unable to make; in great nations the\nGovernment entertains a greater number of general notions, and is more\ncompletely disengaged from the routine of precedent and the egotism\nof local prejudice; its designs are conceived with more talent, and\nexecuted with more boldness.\n\nIn time of peace the well-being of small nations is undoubtedly more\ngeneral and more complete, but they are apt to suffer more acutely from\nthe calamities of war than those great empires whose distant frontiers\nmay for ages avert the presence of the danger from the mass of the\npeople, which is therefore more frequently afflicted than ruined by the\nevil.\n\nBut in this matter, as in many others, the argument derived from the\nnecessity of the case predominates over all others. If none but small\nnations existed, I do not doubt that mankind would be more happy and\nmore free; but the existence of great nations is unavoidable.\n\nThis consideration introduces the element of physical strength as a\ncondition of national prosperity. It profits a people but little to\nbe affluent and free if it is perpetually exposed to be pillaged\nor subjugated; the number of its manufactures and the extent of its\ncommerce are of small advantage if another nation has the empire of the\nseas and gives the law in all the markets of the globe. Small nations\nare often impoverished, not because they are small, but because they are\nweak; the great empires prosper less because they are great than\nbecause they are strong. Physical strength is therefore one of the first\nconditions of the happiness and even of the existence of nations. Hence\nit occurs that, unless very peculiar circumstances intervene, small\nnations are always united to large empires in the end, either by force\nor by their own consent: yet I am unacquainted with a more deplorable\nspectacle than that of a people unable either to defend or to maintain\nits independence.\n\nThe Federal system was created with the intention of combining the\ndifferent advantages which result from the greater and the lesser\nextent of nations; and a single glance over the United States of America\nsuffices to discover the advantages which they have derived from its\nadoption.\n\nIn great centralized nations the legislator is obliged to impart a\ncharacter of uniformity to the laws which does not always suit the\ndiversity of customs and of districts; as he takes no cognizance of\nspecial cases, he can only proceed upon general principles; and the\npopulation is obliged to conform to the exigencies of the legislation,\nsince the legislation cannot adapt itself to the exigencies and the\ncustoms of the population, which is the cause of endless trouble and\nmisery. This disadvantage does not exist in confederations. Congress\nregulates the principal measures of the national Government, and all\nthe details of the administration are reserved to the provincial\nlegislatures. It is impossible to imagine how much this division of\nsovereignty contributes to the well-being of each of the States which\ncompose the Union. In these small communities, which are never agitated\nby the desire of aggrandizement or the cares of self-defence, all public\nauthority and private energy is employed in internal amelioration. The\ncentral government of each State, which is in immediate juxtaposition to\nthe citizens, is daily apprised of the wants which arise in society; and\nnew projects are proposed every year, which are discussed either at town\nmeetings or by the legislature of the State, and which are transmitted\nby the press to stimulate the zeal and to excite the interest of\nthe citizens. This spirit of amelioration is constantly alive in\nthe American republics, without compromising their tranquillity; the\nambition of power yields to the less refined and less dangerous love of\ncomfort. It is generally believed in America that the existence and the\npermanence of the republican form of government in the New World depend\nupon the existence and the permanence of the Federal system; and it is\nnot unusual to attribute a large share of the misfortunes which have\nbefallen the new States of South America to the injudicious erection of\ngreat republics, instead of a divided and confederate sovereignty.\n\nIt is incontestably true that the love and the habits of republican\ngovernment in the United States were engendered in the townships and in\nthe provincial assemblies. In a small State, like that of Connecticut\nfor instance, where cutting a canal or laying down a road is a momentous\npolitical question, where the State has no army to pay and no wars to\ncarry on, and where much wealth and much honor cannot be bestowed upon\nthe chief citizens, no form of government can be more natural or more\nappropriate than that of a republic. But it is this same republican\nspirit, it is these manners and customs of a free people, which are\nengendered and nurtured in the different States, to be afterwards\napplied to the country at large. The public spirit of the Union is, so\nto speak, nothing more than an abstract of the patriotic zeal of the\nprovinces. Every citizen of the United States transfuses his attachment\nto his little republic in the common store of American patriotism. In\ndefending the Union he defends the increasing prosperity of his own\ndistrict, the right of conducting its affairs, and the hope of causing\nmeasures of improvement to be adopted which may be favorable to his own\ninterest; and these are motives which are wont to stir men more readily\nthan the general interests of the country and the glory of the nation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the temper and the manners of the inhabitants\nespecially fitted them to promote the welfare of a great republic, the\nFederal system smoothed the obstacles which they might have encountered.\nThe confederation of all the American States presents none of the\nordinary disadvantages resulting from great agglomerations of men. The\nUnion is a great republic in extent, but the paucity of objects for\nwhich its Government provides assimilates it to a small State. Its acts\nare important, but they are rare. As the sovereignty of the Union is\nlimited and incomplete, its exercise is not incompatible with liberty;\nfor it does not excite those insatiable desires of fame and power which\nhave proved so fatal to great republics. As there is no common centre to\nthe country, vast capital cities, colossal wealth, abject poverty, and\nsudden revolutions are alike unknown; and political passion, instead\nof spreading over the land like a torrent of desolation, spends its\nstrength against the interests and the individual passions of every\nState.\n\nNevertheless, all commodities and ideas circulate throughout the Union\nas freely as in a country inhabited by one people. Nothing checks the\nspirit of enterprise. Government avails itself of the assistance of all\nwho have talents or knowledge to serve it. Within the frontiers of the\nUnion the profoundest peace prevails, as within the heart of some great\nempire; abroad, it ranks with the most powerful nations of the earth;\ntwo thousand miles of coast are open to the commerce of the world; and\nas it possesses the keys of the globe, its flags is respected in the\nmost remote seas. The Union is as happy and as free as a small people,\nand as glorious and as strong as a great nation.\n\nWhy The Federal System Is Not Adapted To All Peoples, And How The\nAnglo-Americans Were Enabled To Adopt It.\n\nEvery Federal system contains defects which baffle the efforts of the\nlegislator--The Federal system is complex--It demands a daily exercise\nof discretion on the part of the citizens--Practical knowledge of\ngovernment common amongst the Americans--Relative weakness of the\nGovernment of the Union, another defect inherent in the Federal\nsystem--The Americans have diminished without remedying it--The\nsovereignty of the separate States apparently weaker, but really\nstronger, than that of the Union--Why?--Natural causes of union must\nexist between confederate peoples besides the laws--What these causes\nare amongst the Anglo-Americans--Maine and Georgia, separated by a\ndistance of a thousand miles, more naturally united than Normandy and\nBrittany--War, the main peril of confederations--This proved even by\nthe example of the United States--The Union has no great wars to\nfear--Why?--Dangers to which Europeans would be exposed if they adopted\nthe Federal system of the Americans.\n\nWhen a legislator succeeds, after persevering efforts, in exercising an\nindirect influence upon the destiny of nations, his genius is lauded\nby mankind, whilst, in point of fact, the geographical position of the\ncountry which he is unable to change, a social condition which arose\nwithout his co-operation, manners and opinions which he cannot trace to\ntheir source, and an origin with which he is unacquainted, exercise so\nirresistible an influence over the courses of society that he is himself\nborne away by the current, after an ineffectual resistance. Like the\nnavigator, he may direct the vessel which bears him along, but he can\nneither change its structure, nor raise the winds, nor lull the waters\nwhich swell beneath him.\n\nI have shown the advantages which the Americans derive from their\nfederal system; it remains for me to point out the circumstances which\nrendered that system practicable, as its benefits are not to be enjoyed\nby all nations. The incidental defects of the Federal system which\noriginate in the laws may be corrected by the skill of the legislator,\nbut there are further evils inherent in the system which cannot be\ncounteracted by the peoples which adopt it. These nations must therefore\nfind the strength necessary to support the natural imperfections of\ntheir Government.\n\nThe most prominent evil of all Federal systems is the very complex\nnature of the means they employ. Two sovereignties are necessarily in\npresence of each other. The legislator may simplify and equalize the\naction of these two sovereignties, by limiting each of them to a sphere\nof authority accurately defined; but he cannot combine them into one, or\nprevent them from coming into collision at certain points. The Federal\nsystem therefore rests upon a theory which is necessarily complicated,\nand which demands the daily exercise of a considerable share of\ndiscretion on the part of those it governs.\n\nA proposition must be plain to be adopted by the understanding of a\npeople. A false notion which is clear and precise will always meet with\na greater number of adherents in the world than a true principle which\nis obscure or involved. Hence it arises that parties, which are like\nsmall communities in the heart of the nation, invariably adopt some\nprinciple or some name as a symbol, which very inadequately represents\nthe end they have in view and the means which are at their disposal, but\nwithout which they could neither act nor subsist. The governments which\nare founded upon a single principle or a single feeling which is easily\ndefined are perhaps not the best, but they are unquestionably the\nstrongest and the most durable in the world.\n\nIn examining the Constitution of the United States, which is the most\nperfect federal constitution that ever existed, one is startled, on\nthe other hand, at the variety of information and the excellence of\ndiscretion which it presupposes in the people whom it is meant to\ngovern. The government of the Union depends entirely upon legal\nfictions; the Union is an ideal nation which only exists in the mind,\nand whose limits and extent can only be discerned by the understanding.\n\nWhen once the general theory is comprehended, numberless difficulties\nremain to be solved in its application; for the sovereignty of the\nUnion is so involved in that of the States that it is impossible to\ndistinguish its boundaries at the first glance. The whole structure\nof the Government is artificial and conventional; and it would be ill\nadapted to a people which has not been long accustomed to conduct\nits own affairs, or to one in which the science of politics has not\ndescended to the humblest classes of society. I have never been more\nstruck by the good sense and the practical judgment of the Americans\nthan in the ingenious devices by which they elude the numberless\ndifficulties resulting from their Federal Constitution. I scarcely\never met with a plain American citizen who could not distinguish, with\nsurprising facility, the obligations created by the laws of Congress\nfrom those created by the laws of his own State; and who, after having\ndiscriminated between the matters which come under the cognizance of the\nUnion and those which the local legislature is competent to regulate,\ncould not point out the exact limit of the several jurisdictions of the\nFederal courts and the tribunals of the State.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States is like those exquisite\nproductions of human industry which ensure wealth and renown to their\ninventors, but which are profitless in any other hands. This truth is\nexemplified by the condition of Mexico at the present time. The Mexicans\nwere desirous of establishing a federal system, and they took the\nFederal Constitution of their neighbors, the Anglo-Americans, as their\nmodel, and copied it with considerable accuracy. *s But although they\nhad borrowed the letter of the law, they were unable to create or\nto introduce the spirit and the sense which give it life. They were\ninvolved in ceaseless embarrassments between the mechanism of their\ndouble government; the sovereignty of the States and that of the Union\nperpetually exceeded their respective privileges, and entered into\ncollision; and to the present day Mexico is alternately the victim of\nanarchy and the slave of military despotism.\n\n[Footnote s: See the Mexican Constitution of 1824.]\n\nThe second and the most fatal of all the defects I have alluded to,\nand that which I believe to be inherent in the federal system, is the\nrelative weakness of the government of the Union. The principle upon\nwhich all confederations rest is that of a divided sovereignty. The\nlegislator may render this partition less perceptible, he may even\nconceal it for a time from the public eye, but he cannot prevent it from\nexisting, and a divided sovereignty must always be less powerful than an\nentire supremacy. The reader has seen in the remarks I have made on\nthe Constitution of the United States that the Americans have displayed\nsingular ingenuity in combining the restriction of the power of\nthe Union within the narrow limits of a federal government with the\nsemblance and, to a certain extent, with the force of a national\ngovernment. By this means the legislators of the Union have succeeded\nin diminishing, though not in counteracting the natural danger of\nconfederations.\n\nIt has been remarked that the American Government does not apply itself\nto the States, but that it immediately transmits its injunctions to the\ncitizens, and compels them as isolated individuals to comply with its\ndemands. But if the Federal law were to clash with the interests and the\nprejudices of a State, it might be feared that all the citizens of\nthat State would conceive themselves to be interested in the cause of a\nsingle individual who should refuse to obey. If all the citizens of\nthe State were aggrieved at the same time and in the same manner by the\nauthority of the Union, the Federal Government would vainly attempt to\nsubdue them individually; they would instinctively unite in a common\ndefence, and they would derive a ready-prepared organization from the\nshare of sovereignty which the institution of their State allows them\nto enjoy. Fiction would give way to reality, and an organized portion\nof the territory might then contest the central authority. *t The same\nobservation holds good with regard to the Federal jurisdiction. If the\ncourts of the Union violated an important law of a State in a private\ncase, the real, if not the apparent, contest would arise between the\naggrieved State represented by a citizen and the Union represented by\nits courts of justice. *u\n\n[Footnote t: [This is precisely what occurred in 1862, and the following\nparagraph describes correctly the feelings and notions of the South.\nGeneral Lee held that his primary allegiance was due, not to the Union,\nbut to Virginia.]]\n\n[Footnote u: For instance, the Union possesses by the Constitution the\nright of selling unoccupied lands for its own profit. Supposing that\nthe State of Ohio should claim the same right in behalf of certain\nterritories lying within its boundaries, upon the plea that the\nConstitution refers to those lands alone which do not belong to the\njurisdiction of any particular State, and consequently should choose to\ndispose of them itself, the litigation would be carried on in the names\nof the purchasers from the State of Ohio and the purchasers from the\nUnion, and not in the names of Ohio and the Union. But what would become\nof this legal fiction if the Federal purchaser was confirmed in his\nright by the courts of the Union, whilst the other competitor was\nordered to retain possession by the tribunals of the State of Ohio?]\n\nHe would have but a partial knowledge of the world who should imagine\nthat it is possible, by the aid of legal fictions, to prevent men from\nfinding out and employing those means of gratifying their passions which\nhave been left open to them; and it may be doubted whether the American\nlegislators, when they rendered a collision between the two sovereigns\nless probable, destroyed the cause of such a misfortune. But it may even\nbe affirmed that they were unable to ensure the preponderance of the\nFederal element in a case of this kind. The Union is possessed of money\nand of troops, but the affections and the prejudices of the people are\nin the bosom of the States. The sovereignty of the Union is an abstract\nbeing, which is connected with but few external objects; the sovereignty\nof the States is hourly perceptible, easily understood, constantly\nactive; and if the former is of recent creation, the latter is coeval\nwith the people itself. The sovereignty of the Union is factitious, that\nof the States is natural, and derives its existence from its own simple\ninfluence, like the authority of a parent. The supreme power of\nthe nation only affects a few of the chief interests of society; it\nrepresents an immense but remote country, and claims a feeling of\npatriotism which is vague and ill defined; but the authority of the\nStates controls every individual citizen at every hour and in all\ncircumstances; it protects his property, his freedom, and his life; and\nwhen we recollect the traditions, the customs, the prejudices of local\nand familiar attachment with which it is connected, we cannot doubt of\nthe superiority of a power which is interwoven with every circumstance\nthat renders the love of one's native country instinctive in the human\nheart.\n\nSince legislators are unable to obviate such dangerous collisions as\noccur between the two sovereignties which coexist in the federal system,\ntheir first object must be, not only to dissuade the confederate States\nfrom warfare, but to encourage such institutions as may promote the\nmaintenance of peace. Hence it results that the Federal compact cannot\nbe lasting unless there exists in the communities which are leagued\ntogether a certain number of inducements to union which render their\ncommon dependence agreeable, and the task of the Government light,\nand that system cannot succeed without the presence of favorable\ncircumstances added to the influence of good laws. All the peoples which\nhave ever formed a confederation have been held together by a certain\nnumber of common interests, which served as the intellectual ties of\nassociation.\n\nBut the sentiments and the principles of man must be taken into\nconsideration as well as his immediate interests. A certain uniformity\nof civilization is not less necessary to the durability of a\nconfederation than a uniformity of interests in the States which compose\nit. In Switzerland the difference which exists between the Canton of Uri\nand the Canton of Vaud is equal to that between the fifteenth and the\nnineteenth centuries; and, properly speaking, Switzerland has never\npossessed a federal government. The union between these two cantons only\nsubsists upon the map, and their discrepancies would soon be perceived\nif an attempt were made by a central authority to prescribe the same\nlaws to the whole territory.\n\nOne of the circumstances which most powerfully contribute to support the\nFederal Government in America is that the States have not only similar\ninterests, a common origin, and a common tongue, but that they are also\narrived at the same stage of civilization; which almost always renders\na union feasible. I do not know of any European nation, how small soever\nit may be, which does not present less uniformity in its different\nprovinces than the American people, which occupies a territory as\nextensive as one-half of Europe. The distance from the State of Maine\nto that of Georgia is reckoned at about one thousand miles; but the\ndifference between the civilization of Maine and that of Georgia is\nslighter than the difference between the habits of Normandy and those\nof Brittany. Maine and Georgia, which are placed at the opposite\nextremities of a great empire, are consequently in the natural\npossession of more real inducements to form a confederation than\nNormandy and Brittany, which are only separated by a bridge.\n\nThe geographical position of the country contributed to increase the\nfacilities which the American legislators derived from the manners and\ncustoms of the inhabitants; and it is to this circumstance that\nthe adoption and the maintenance of the Federal system are mainly\nattributable.\n\nThe most important occurrence which can mark the annals of a people is\nthe breaking out of a war. In war a people struggles with the energy\nof a single man against foreign nations in the defence of its very\nexistence. The skill of a government, the good sense of the community,\nand the natural fondness which men entertain for their country, may\nsuffice to maintain peace in the interior of a district, and to favor\nits internal prosperity; but a nation can only carry on a great war at\nthe cost of more numerous and more painful sacrifices; and to suppose\nthat a great number of men will of their own accord comply with these\nexigencies of the State is to betray an ignorance of mankind. All the\npeoples which have been obliged to sustain a long and serious warfare\nhave consequently been led to augment the power of their government.\nThose which have not succeeded in this attempt have been subjugated.\nA long war almost always places nations in the wretched alternative\nof being abandoned to ruin by defeat or to despotism by success. War\ntherefore renders the symptoms of the weakness of a government most\npalpable and most alarming; and I have shown that the inherent defeat of\nfederal governments is that of being weak.\n\nThe Federal system is not only deficient in every kind of centralized\nadministration, but the central government itself is imperfectly\norganized, which is invariably an influential cause of inferiority when\nthe nation is opposed to other countries which are themselves governed\nby a single authority. In the Federal Constitution of the United States,\nby which the central government possesses more real force, this evil\nis still extremely sensible. An example will illustrate the case to the\nreader.\n\nThe Constitution confers upon Congress the right of calling forth\nmilitia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and\nrepel invasions; and another article declares that the President of the\nUnited States is the commander-in-chief of the militia. In the war of\n1812 the President ordered the militia of the Northern States to march\nto the frontiers; but Connecticut and Massachusetts, whose interests\nwere impaired by the war, refused to obey the command. They argued that\nthe Constitution authorizes the Federal Government to call forth the\nmilitia in case of insurrection or invasion, but that in the present\ninstance there was neither invasion nor insurrection. They added,\nthat the same Constitution which conferred upon the Union the right\nof calling forth the militia reserved to the States that of naming\nthe officers; and that consequently (as they understood the clause) no\nofficer of the Union had any right to command the militia, even during\nwar, except the President in person; and in this case they were ordered\nto join an army commanded by another individual. These absurd and\npernicious doctrines received the sanction not only of the governors\nand the legislative bodies, but also of the courts of justice in both\nStates; and the Federal Government was constrained to raise elsewhere\nthe troops which it required. *v\n\n[Footnote v: Kent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. i. p. 244. I have selected an\nexample which relates to a time posterior to the promulgation of\nthe present Constitution. If I had gone back to the days of the\nConfederation, I might have given still more striking instances. The\nwhole nation was at that time in a state of enthusiastic excitement; the\nRevolution was represented by a man who was the idol of the people; but\nat that very period Congress had, to say the truth, no resources at\nall at its disposal. Troops and supplies were perpetually wanting. The\nbest-devised projects failed in the execution, and the Union, which was\nconstantly on the verge of destruction, was saved by the weakness of its\nenemies far more than by its own strength. [All doubt as to the powers\nof the Federal Executive was, however, removed by its efforts in the\nCivil War, and those powers were largely extended.]]\n\nThe only safeguard which the American Union, with all the relative\nperfection of its laws, possesses against the dissolution which would\nbe produced by a great war, lies in its probable exemption from that\ncalamity. Placed in the centre of an immense continent, which offers\na boundless field for human industry, the Union is almost as much\ninsulated from the world as if its frontiers were girt by the ocean.\nCanada contains only a million of inhabitants, and its population is\ndivided into two inimical nations. The rigor of the climate limits the\nextension of its territory, and shuts up its ports during the six months\nof winter. From Canada to the Gulf of Mexico a few savage tribes are\nto be met with, which retire, perishing in their retreat, before six\nthousand soldiers. To the South, the Union has a point of contact with\nthe empire of Mexico; and it is thence that serious hostilities may one\nday be expected to arise. But for a long while to come the uncivilized\nstate of the Mexican community, the depravity of its morals, and its\nextreme poverty, will prevent that country from ranking high amongst\nnations. *w As for the Powers of Europe, they are too distant to be\nformidable.\n\n[Footnote w: [War broke out between the United States and Mexico in\n1846, and ended in the conquest of an immense territory, including\nCalifornia.]]\n\nThe great advantage of the United States does not, then, consist in a\nFederal Constitution which allows them to carry on great wars, but in\na geographical position which renders such enterprises extremely\nimprobable.\n\nNo one can be more inclined than I am myself to appreciate the\nadvantages of the federal system, which I hold to be one of the\ncombinations most favorable to the prosperity and freedom of man. I\nenvy the lot of those nations which have been enabled to adopt it; but I\ncannot believe that any confederate peoples could maintain a long or an\nequal contest with a nation of similar strength in which the government\nshould be centralized. A people which should divide its sovereignty into\nfractional powers, in the presence of the great military monarchies of\nEurope, would, in my opinion, by that very act, abdicate its power, and\nperhaps its existence and its name. But such is the admirable position\nof the New World that man has no other enemy than himself; and that,\nin order to be happy and to be free, it suffices to seek the gifts of\nprosperity and the knowledge of freedom.\n\n\n\n\nChapter IX: Why The People May Strictly Be Said To Govern In The United\nStates\n\nI have hitherto examined the institutions of the United States; I have\npassed their legislation in review, and I have depicted the present\ncharacteristics of political society in that country. But a sovereign\npower exists above these institutions and beyond these characteristic\nfeatures which may destroy or modify them at its pleasure--I mean that\nof the people. It remains to be shown in what manner this power, which\nregulates the laws, acts: its propensities and its passions remain to be\npointed out, as well as the secret springs which retard, accelerate,\nor direct its irresistible course; and the effects of its unbounded\nauthority, with the destiny which is probably reserved for it.\n\nIn America the people appoints the legislative and the executive power,\nand furnishes the jurors who punish all offences against the laws. The\nAmerican institutions are democratic, not only in their principle but\nin all their consequences; and the people elects its representatives\ndirectly, and for the most part annually, in order to ensure their\ndependence. The people is therefore the real directing power; and\nalthough the form of government is representative, it is evident that\nthe opinions, the prejudices, the interests, and even the passions of\nthe community are hindered by no durable obstacles from exercising\na perpetual influence on society. In the United States the majority\ngoverns in the name of the people, as is the case in all the countries\nin which the people is supreme. The majority is principally composed\nof peaceful citizens who, either by inclination or by interest, are\nsincerely desirous of the welfare of their country. But they are\nsurrounded by the incessant agitation of parties, which attempt to gain\ntheir co-operation and to avail themselves of their support.\n\n\n\n\nChapter X: Parties In The United States\n\nChapter Summary\n\nGreat distinction to be made between parties--Parties which are to each\nother as rival nations--Parties properly so called--Difference\nbetween great and small parties--Epochs which produce them--Their\ncharacteristics--America has had great parties--They are\nextinct--Federalists--Republicans--Defeat of the Federalists--Difficulty\nof creating parties in the United States--What is done with this\nintention--Aristocratic or democratic character to be met with in all\nparties--Struggle of General Jackson against the Bank.\n\nParties In The United States\n\nA great distinction must be made between parties. Some countries are\nso large that the different populations which inhabit them have\ncontradictory interests, although they are the subjects of the same\nGovernment, and they may thence be in a perpetual state of opposition.\nIn this case the different fractions of the people may more properly be\nconsidered as distinct nations than as mere parties; and if a civil war\nbreaks out, the struggle is carried on by rival peoples rather than by\nfactions in the State.\n\nBut when the citizens entertain different opinions upon subjects which\naffect the whole country alike, such, for instance, as the principles\nupon which the government is to be conducted, then distinctions arise\nwhich may correctly be styled parties. Parties are a necessary evil in\nfree governments; but they have not at all times the same character and\nthe same propensities.\n\nAt certain periods a nation may be oppressed by such insupportable evils\nas to conceive the design of effecting a total change in its political\nconstitution; at other times the mischief lies still deeper, and the\nexistence of society itself is endangered. Such are the times of great\nrevolutions and of great parties. But between these epochs of misery and\nof confusion there are periods during which human society seems to rest,\nand mankind to make a pause. This pause is, indeed, only apparent, for\ntime does not stop its course for nations any more than for men; they\nare all advancing towards a goal with which they are unacquainted; and\nwe only imagine them to be stationary when their progress escapes our\nobservation, as men who are going at a foot-pace seem to be standing\nstill to those who run.\n\nBut however this may be, there are certain epochs at which the changes\nthat take place in the social and political constitution of nations are\nso slow and so insensible that men imagine their present condition to be\na final state; and the human mind, believing itself to be firmly based\nupon certain foundations, does not extend its researches beyond the\nhorizon which it descries. These are the times of small parties and of\nintrigue.\n\nThe political parties which I style great are those which cling to\nprinciples more than to their consequences; to general, and not to\nespecial cases; to ideas, and not to men. These parties are usually\ndistinguished by a nobler character, by more generous passions, more\ngenuine convictions, and a more bold and open conduct than the others.\nIn them private interest, which always plays the chief part in political\npassions, is more studiously veiled under the pretext of the public\ngood; and it may even be sometimes concealed from the eyes of the very\npersons whom it excites and impels.\n\nMinor parties are, on the other hand, generally deficient in political\nfaith. As they are not sustained or dignified by a lofty purpose, they\nostensibly display the egotism of their character in their actions.\nThey glow with a factitious zeal; their language is vehement, but their\nconduct is timid and irresolute. The means they employ are as wretched\nas the end at which they aim. Hence it arises that when a calm state\nof things succeeds a violent revolution, the leaders of society\nseem suddenly to disappear, and the powers of the human mind to lie\nconcealed. Society is convulsed by great parties, by minor ones it is\nagitated; it is torn by the former, by the latter it is degraded; and\nif these sometimes save it by a salutary perturbation, those invariably\ndisturb it to no good end.\n\nAmerica has already lost the great parties which once divided the\nnation; and if her happiness is considerably increased, her morality\nhas suffered by their extinction. When the War of Independence was\nterminated, and the foundations of the new Government were to be laid\ndown, the nation was divided between two opinions--two opinions which\nare as old as the world, and which are perpetually to be met with\nunder all the forms and all the names which have ever obtained in free\ncommunities--the one tending to limit, the other to extend indefinitely,\nthe power of the people. The conflict of these two opinions never\nassumed that degree of violence in America which it has frequently\ndisplayed elsewhere. Both parties of the Americans were, in fact, agreed\nupon the most essential points; and neither of them had to destroy a\ntraditionary constitution, or to overthrow the structure of society, in\norder to ensure its own triumph. In neither of them, consequently, were\na great number of private interests affected by success or by defeat;\nbut moral principles of a high order, such as the love of equality and\nof independence, were concerned in the struggle, and they sufficed to\nkindle violent passions.\n\nThe party which desired to limit the power of the people endeavored to\napply its doctrines more especially to the Constitution of the Union,\nwhence it derived its name of Federal. The other party, which affected\nto be more exclusively attached to the cause of liberty, took that of\nRepublican. America is a land of democracy, and the Federalists were\nalways in a minority; but they reckoned on their side almost all the\ngreat men who had been called forth by the War of Independence, and\ntheir moral influence was very considerable. Their cause was, moreover,\nfavored by circumstances. The ruin of the Confederation had impressed\nthe people with a dread of anarchy, and the Federalists did not fail to\nprofit by this transient disposition of the multitude. For ten or twelve\nyears they were at the head of affairs, and they were able to apply\nsome, though not all, of their principles; for the hostile current was\nbecoming from day to day too violent to be checked or stemmed. In 1801\nthe Republicans got possession of the Government; Thomas Jefferson was\nnamed President; and he increased the influence of their party by the\nweight of his celebrity, the greatness of his talents, and the immense\nextent of his popularity.\n\nThe means by which the Federalists had maintained their position were\nartificial, and their resources were temporary; it was by the virtues\nor the talents of their leaders that they had risen to power. When\nthe Republicans attained to that lofty station, their opponents were\noverwhelmed by utter defeat. An immense majority declared itself against\nthe retiring party, and the Federalists found themselves in so small a\nminority that they at once despaired of their future success. From that\nmoment the Republican or Democratic party *a has proceeded from conquest\nto conquest, until it has acquired absolute supremacy in the country.\nThe Federalists, perceiving that they were vanquished without resource,\nand isolated in the midst of the nation, fell into two divisions, of\nwhich one joined the victorious Republicans, and the other abandoned its\nrallying-point and its name. Many years have already elapsed since they\nceased to exist as a party.\n\n[Footnote a: [It is scarcely necessary to remark that in more recent\ntimes the signification of these terms has changed. The Republicans are\nthe representatives of the old Federalists, and the Democrats of the old\nRepublicans.--Trans. Note (1861).]] The accession of the Federalists\nto power was, in my opinion, one of the most fortunate incidents which\naccompanied the formation of the great American Union; they resisted\nthe inevitable propensities of their age and of the country. But\nwhether their theories were good or bad, they had the effect of being\ninapplicable, as a system, to the society which they professed to\ngovern, and that which occurred under the auspices of Jefferson must\ntherefore have taken place sooner or later. But their Government gave\nthe new republic time to acquire a certain stability, and afterwards to\nsupport the rapid growth of the very doctrines which they had combated.\nA considerable number of their principles were in point of fact embodied\nin the political creed of their opponents; and the Federal Constitution\nwhich subsists at the present day is a lasting monument of their\npatriotism and their wisdom.\n\nGreat political parties are not, then, to be met with in the United\nStates at the present time. Parties, indeed, may be found which threaten\nthe future tranquillity of the Union; but there are none which seem to\ncontest the present form of Government or the present course of society.\nThe parties by which the Union is menaced do not rest upon abstract\nprinciples, but upon temporal interests. These interests, disseminated\nin the provinces of so vast an empire, may be said to constitute rival\nnations rather than parties. Thus, upon a recent occasion, the North\ncontended for the system of commercial prohibition, and the South\ntook up arms in favor of free trade, simply because the North is a\nmanufacturing and the South an agricultural district; and that the\nrestrictive system which was profitable to the one was prejudicial to\nthe other. *b\n\n[Footnote b: [The divisions of North and South have since acquired a\nfar greater degree of intensity, and the South, though conquered,\nstill presents a formidable spirit of opposition to Northern\ngovernment.--Translator's Note, 1875.]]\n\nIn the absence of great parties, the United States abound with lesser\ncontroversies; and public opinion is divided into a thousand minute\nshades of difference upon questions of very little moment. The pains\nwhich are taken to create parties are inconceivable, and at the present\nday it is no easy task. In the United States there is no religious\nanimosity, because all religion is respected, and no sect is\npredominant; there is no jealousy of rank, because the people is\neverything, and none can contest its authority; lastly, there is no\npublic indigence to supply the means of agitation, because the physical\nposition of the country opens so wide a field to industry that man is\nable to accomplish the most surprising undertakings with his own native\nresources. Nevertheless, ambitious men are interested in the creation of\nparties, since it is difficult to eject a person from authority upon the\nmere ground that his place is coveted by others. The skill of the actors\nin the political world lies therefore in the art of creating parties. A\npolitical aspirant in the United States begins by discriminating his own\ninterest, and by calculating upon those interests which may be collected\naround and amalgamated with it; he then contrives to discover some\ndoctrine or some principle which may suit the purposes of this new\nassociation, and which he adopts in order to bring forward his party and\nto secure his popularity; just as the imprimatur of a King was in former\ndays incorporated with the volume which it authorized, but to which it\nnowise belonged. When these preliminaries are terminated, the new party\nis ushered into the political world.\n\nAll the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a\nstranger to be so incomprehensible and so puerile that he is at a\nloss whether to pity a people which takes such arrant trifles in good\nearnest, or to envy the happiness which enables it to discuss them. But\nwhen he comes to study the secret propensities which govern the factions\nof America, he easily perceives that the greater part of them are more\nor less connected with one or the other of those two divisions which\nhave always existed in free communities. The deeper we penetrate into\nthe working of these parties, the more do we perceive that the object\nof the one is to limit, and that of the other to extend, the popular\nauthority. I do not assert that the ostensible end, or even that the\nsecret aim, of American parties is to promote the rule of aristocracy or\ndemocracy in the country; but I affirm that aristocratic or democratic\npassions may easily be detected at the bottom of all parties, and that,\nalthough they escape a superficial observation, they are the main point\nand the very soul of every faction in the United States.\n\nTo quote a recent example. When the President attacked the Bank, the\ncountry was excited and parties were formed; the well-informed classes\nrallied round the Bank, the common people round the President. But it\nmust not be imagined that the people had formed a rational opinion upon\na question which offers so many difficulties to the most experienced\nstatesmen. The Bank is a great establishment which enjoys an independent\nexistence, and the people, accustomed to make and unmake whatsoever it\npleases, is startled to meet with this obstacle to its authority. In the\nmidst of the perpetual fluctuation of society the community is irritated\nby so permanent an institution, and is led to attack it in order to see\nwhether it can be shaken and controlled, like all the other institutions\nof the country.\n\nRemains Of The Aristocratic Party In The United States\n\nSecret opposition of wealthy individuals to democracy--Their\nretirement--Their taste for exclusive pleasures and for luxury at\nhome--Their simplicity abroad--Their affected condescension towards the\npeople.\n\nIt sometimes happens in a people amongst which various opinions prevail\nthat the balance of the several parties is lost, and one of them obtains\nan irresistible preponderance, overpowers all obstacles, harasses its\nopponents, and appropriates all the resources of society to its own\npurposes. The vanquished citizens despair of success and they conceal\ntheir dissatisfaction in silence and in general apathy. The nation seems\nto be governed by a single principle, and the prevailing party assumes\nthe credit of having restored peace and unanimity to the country. But\nthis apparent unanimity is merely a cloak to alarming dissensions and\nperpetual opposition.\n\nThis is precisely what occurred in America; when the democratic party\ngot the upper hand, it took exclusive possession of the conduct of\naffairs, and from that time the laws and the customs of society have\nbeen adapted to its caprices. At the present day the more affluent\nclasses of society are so entirely removed from the direction of\npolitical affairs in the United States that wealth, far from conferring\na right to the exercise of power, is rather an obstacle than a means of\nattaining to it. The wealthy members of the community abandon the lists,\nthrough unwillingness to contend, and frequently to contend in vain,\nagainst the poorest classes of their fellow citizens. They concentrate\nall their enjoyments in the privacy of their homes, where they occupy\na rank which cannot be assumed in public; and they constitute a private\nsociety in the State, which has its own tastes and its own pleasures.\nThey submit to this state of things as an irremediable evil, but they\nare careful not to show that they are galled by its continuance; it\nis even not uncommon to hear them laud the delights of a republican\ngovernment, and the advantages of democratic institutions when they\nare in public. Next to hating their enemies, men are most inclined to\nflatter them.\n\nMark, for instance, that opulent citizen, who is as anxious as a Jew of\nthe Middle Ages to conceal his wealth. His dress is plain, his demeanor\nunassuming; but the interior of his dwelling glitters with luxury, and\nnone but a few chosen guests whom he haughtily styles his equals are\nallowed to penetrate into this sanctuary. No European noble is more\nexclusive in his pleasures, or more jealous of the smallest advantages\nwhich his privileged station confers upon him. But the very same\nindividual crosses the city to reach a dark counting-house in the centre\nof traffic, where every one may accost him who pleases. If he meets his\ncobbler upon the way, they stop and converse; the two citizens discuss\nthe affairs of the State in which they have an equal interest, and they\nshake hands before they part.\n\nBut beneath this artificial enthusiasm, and these obsequious attentions\nto the preponderating power, it is easy to perceive that the wealthy\nmembers of the community entertain a hearty distaste to the democratic\ninstitutions of their country. The populace is at once the object\nof their scorn and of their fears. If the maladministration of the\ndemocracy ever brings about a revolutionary crisis, and if monarchical\ninstitutions ever become practicable in the United States, the truth of\nwhat I advance will become obvious.\n\nThe two chief weapons which parties use in order to ensure success are\nthe public press and the formation of associations.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XI: Liberty Of The Press In The United States\n\nChapter Summary\n\nDifficulty of restraining the liberty of the press--Particular reasons\nwhich some nations have to cherish this liberty--The liberty of the\npress a necessary consequence of the sovereignty of the people as it is\nunderstood in America--Violent language of the periodical press in the\nUnited States--Propensities of the periodical press--Illustrated by the\nUnited States--Opinion of the Americans upon the repression of the abuse\nof the liberty of the press by judicial prosecutions--Reasons for which\nthe press is less powerful in America than in France.\n\nLiberty Of The Press In The United States\n\nThe influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political\nopinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it\nmodifies customs as well as laws. In another part of this work I shall\nattempt to determinate the degree of influence which the liberty of\nthe press has exercised upon civil society in the United States, and to\npoint out the direction which it has given to the ideas, as well as the\ntone which it has imparted to the character and the feelings, of the\nAnglo-Americans, but at present I purpose simply to examine the effects\nproduced by the liberty of the press in the political world.\n\nI confess that I do not entertain that firm and complete attachment to\nthe liberty of the press which things that are supremely good in their\nvery nature are wont to excite in the mind; and I approve of it more\nfrom a recollection of the evils it prevents than from a consideration\nof the advantages it ensures.\n\nIf any one could point out an intermediate and yet a tenable position\nbetween the complete independence and the entire subjection of the\npublic expression of opinion, I should perhaps be inclined to adopt it;\nbut the difficulty is to discover this position. If it is your intention\nto correct the abuses of unlicensed printing and to restore the use of\norderly language, you may in the first instance try the offender by\na jury; but if the jury acquits him, the opinion which was that of a\nsingle individual becomes the opinion of the country at large. Too much\nand too little has therefore hitherto been done. If you proceed, you\nmust bring the delinquent before a court of permanent judges. But even\nhere the cause must be heard before it can be decided; and the very\nprinciples which no book would have ventured to avow are blazoned\nforth in the pleadings, and what was obscurely hinted at in a single\ncomposition is then repeated in a multitude of other publications.\nThe language in which a thought is embodied is the mere carcass of the\nthought, and not the idea itself; tribunals may condemn the form, but\nthe sense and spirit of the work is too subtle for their authority. Too\nmuch has still been done to recede, too little to attain your end; you\nmust therefore proceed. If you establish a censorship of the press, the\ntongue of the public speaker will still make itself heard, and you have\nonly increased the mischief. The powers of thought do not rely, like the\npowers of physical strength, upon the number of their mechanical agents,\nnor can a host of authors be reckoned like the troops which compose an\narmy; on the contrary, the authority of a principle is often increased\nby the smallness of the number of men by whom it is expressed. The\nwords of a strong-minded man, which penetrate amidst the passions of a\nlistening assembly, have more power than the vociferations of a thousand\norators; and if it be allowed to speak freely in any public place,\nthe consequence is the same as if free speaking was allowed in every\nvillage. The liberty of discourse must therefore be destroyed as well\nas the liberty of the press; this is the necessary term of your efforts;\nbut if your object was to repress the abuses of liberty, they have\nbrought you to the feet of a despot. You have been led from the extreme\nof independence to the extreme of subjection without meeting with a\nsingle tenable position for shelter or repose.\n\nThere are certain nations which have peculiar reasons for cherishing the\nliberty of the press, independently of the general motives which I have\njust pointed out. For in certain countries which profess to enjoy the\nprivileges of freedom every individual agent of the Government may\nviolate the laws with impunity, since those whom he oppresses cannot\nprosecute him before the courts of justice. In this case the liberty of\nthe press is not merely a guarantee, but it is the only guarantee, of\ntheir liberty and their security which the citizens possess. If the\nrulers of these nations propose to abolish the independence of the\npress, the people would be justified in saying: Give us the right of\nprosecuting your offences before the ordinary tribunals, and perhaps we\nmay then waive our right of appeal to the tribunal of public opinion.\n\nBut in the countries in which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the\npeople ostensibly prevails, the censorship of the press is not only\ndangerous, but it is absurd. When the right of every citizen to\nco-operate in the government of society is acknowledged, every citizen\nmust be presumed to possess the power of discriminating between the\ndifferent opinions of his contemporaries, and of appreciating the\ndifferent facts from which inferences may be drawn. The sovereignty of\nthe people and the liberty of the press may therefore be looked upon\nas correlative institutions; just as the censorship of the press and\nuniversal suffrage are two things which are irreconcilably opposed, and\nwhich cannot long be retained among the institutions of the same people.\nNot a single individual of the twelve millions who inhabit the territory\nof the United States has as yet dared to propose any restrictions to\nthe liberty of the press. The first newspaper over which I cast my eyes,\nupon my arrival in America, contained the following article:\n\nIn all this affair the language of Jackson has been that of a heartless\ndespot, solely occupied with the preservation of his own authority.\nAmbition is his crime, and it will be his punishment too: intrigue is\nhis native element, and intrigue will confound his tricks, and will\ndeprive him of his power: he governs by means of corruption, and his\nimmoral practices will redound to his shame and confusion. His conduct\nin the political arena has been that of a shameless and lawless\ngamester. He succeeded at the time, but the hour of retribution\napproaches, and he will be obliged to disgorge his winnings, to throw\naside his false dice, and to end his days in some retirement, where he\nmay curse his madness at his leisure; for repentance is a virtue with\nwhich his heart is likely to remain forever unacquainted.\n\nIt is not uncommonly imagined in France that the virulence of the\npress originates in the uncertain social condition, in the political\nexcitement, and the general sense of consequent evil which prevail in\nthat country; and it is therefore supposed that as soon as society has\nresumed a certain degree of composure the press will abandon its present\nvehemence. I am inclined to think that the above causes explain the\nreason of the extraordinary ascendency it has acquired over the nation,\nbut that they do not exercise much influence upon the tone of its\nlanguage. The periodical press appears to me to be actuated by passions\nand propensities independent of the circumstances in which it is placed,\nand the present position of America corroborates this opinion.\n\nAmerica is perhaps, at this moment, the country of the whole world\nwhich contains the fewest germs of revolution; but the press is not less\ndestructive in its principles than in France, and it displays the same\nviolence without the same reasons for indignation. In America, as\nin France, it constitutes a singular power, so strangely composed of\nmingled good and evil that it is at the same time indispensable to the\nexistence of freedom, and nearly incompatible with the maintenance of\npublic order. Its power is certainly much greater in France than in the\nUnited States; though nothing is more rare in the latter country than to\nhear of a prosecution having been instituted against it. The reason\nof this is perfectly simple: the Americans, having once admitted\nthe doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, apply it with perfect\nconsistency. It was never their intention to found a permanent state\nof things with elements which undergo daily modifications; and there\nis consequently nothing criminal in an attack upon the existing laws,\nprovided it be not attended with a violent infraction of them. They\nare moreover of opinion that courts of justice are unable to check\nthe abuses of the press; and that as the subtilty of human language\nperpetually eludes the severity of judicial analysis, offences of this\nnature are apt to escape the hand which attempts to apprehend them. They\nhold that to act with efficacy upon the press it would be necessary to\nfind a tribunal, not only devoted to the existing order of things, but\ncapable of surmounting the influence of public opinion; a tribunal which\nshould conduct its proceedings without publicity, which should pronounce\nits decrees without assigning its motives, and punish the intentions\neven more than the language of an author. Whosoever should have the\npower of creating and maintaining a tribunal of this kind would waste\nhis time in prosecuting the liberty of the press; for he would be the\nsupreme master of the whole community, and he would be as free to\nrid himself of the authors as of their writings. In this question,\ntherefore, there is no medium between servitude and extreme license; in\norder to enjoy the inestimable benefits which the liberty of the press\nensures, it is necessary to submit to the inevitable evils which it\nengenders. To expect to acquire the former and to escape the latter\nis to cherish one of those illusions which commonly mislead nations\nin their times of sickness, when, tired with faction and exhausted by\neffort, they attempt to combine hostile opinions and contrary principles\nupon the same soil.\n\nThe small influence of the American journals is attributable to several\nreasons, amongst which are the following:\n\nThe liberty of writing, like all other liberty, is most formidable\nwhen it is a novelty; for a people which has never been accustomed to\nco-operate in the conduct of State affairs places implicit confidence\nin the first tribune who arouses its attention. The Anglo-Americans\nhave enjoyed this liberty ever since the foundation of the settlements;\nmoreover, the press cannot create human passions by its own power,\nhowever skillfully it may kindle them where they exist. In America\npolitics are discussed with animation and a varied activity, but they\nrarely touch those deep passions which are excited whenever the positive\ninterest of a part of the community is impaired: but in the United\nStates the interests of the community are in a most prosperous\ncondition. A single glance upon a French and an American newspaper is\nsufficient to show the difference which exists between the two nations\non this head. In France the space allotted to commercial advertisements\nis very limited, and the intelligence is not considerable, but the most\nessential part of the journal is that which contains the discussion of\nthe politics of the day. In America three-quarters of the enormous sheet\nwhich is set before the reader are filled with advertisements, and the\nremainder is frequently occupied by political intelligence or trivial\nanecdotes: it is only from time to time that one finds a corner devoted\nto passionate discussions like those with which the journalists of\nFrance are wont to indulge their readers.\n\nIt has been demonstrated by observation, and discovered by the innate\nsagacity of the pettiest as well as the greatest of despots, that the\ninfluence of a power is increased in proportion as its direction\nis rendered more central. In France the press combines a twofold\ncentralization; almost all its power is centred in the same spot, and\nvested in the same hands, for its organs are far from numerous. The\ninfluence of a public press thus constituted, upon a sceptical nation,\nmust be unbounded. It is an enemy with which a Government may sign an\noccasional truce, but which it is difficult to resist for any length of\ntime.\n\nNeither of these kinds of centralization exists in America. The United\nStates have no metropolis; the intelligence as well as the power of the\ncountry are dispersed abroad, and instead of radiating from a point,\nthey cross each other in every direction; the Americans have established\nno central control over the expression of opinion, any more than over\nthe conduct of business. These are circumstances which do not depend on\nhuman foresight; but it is owing to the laws of the Union that there\nare no licenses to be granted to printers, no securities demanded from\neditors as in France, and no stamp duty as in France and formerly in\nEngland. The consequence of this is that nothing is easier than to set\nup a newspaper, and a small number of readers suffices to defray the\nexpenses of the editor.\n\nThe number of periodical and occasional publications which appears\nin the United States actually surpasses belief. The most enlightened\nAmericans attribute the subordinate influence of the press to this\nexcessive dissemination; and it is adopted as an axiom of political\nscience in that country that the only way to neutralize the effect of\npublic journals is to multiply them indefinitely. I cannot conceive\nthat a truth which is so self-evident should not already have been more\ngenerally admitted in Europe; it is comprehensible that the persons who\nhope to bring about revolutions by means of the press should be desirous\nof confining its action to a few powerful organs, but it is perfectly\nincredible that the partisans of the existing state of things, and the\nnatural supporters of the law, should attempt to diminish the influence\nof the press by concentrating its authority. The Governments of Europe\nseem to treat the press with the courtesy of the knights of old; they\nare anxious to furnish it with the same central power which they have\nfound to be so trusty a weapon, in order to enhance the glory of their\nresistance to its attacks.\n\nIn America there is scarcely a hamlet which has not its own newspaper.\nIt may readily be imagined that neither discipline nor unity of\ndesign can be communicated to so multifarious a host, and each one is\nconsequently led to fight under his own standard. All the political\njournals of the United States are indeed arrayed on the side of the\nadministration or against it; but they attack and defend in a thousand\ndifferent ways. They cannot succeed in forming those great currents of\nopinion which overwhelm the most solid obstacles. This division of the\ninfluence of the press produces a variety of other consequences which\nare scarcely less remarkable. The facility with which journals can be\nestablished induces a multitude of individuals to take a part in\nthem; but as the extent of competition precludes the possibility of\nconsiderable profit, the most distinguished classes of society are\nrarely led to engage in these undertakings. But such is the number of\nthe public prints that, even if they were a source of wealth, writers\nof ability could not be found to direct them all. The journalists of\nthe United States are usually placed in a very humble position, with a\nscanty education and a vulgar turn of mind. The will of the majority is\nthe most general of laws, and it establishes certain habits which form\nthe characteristics of each peculiar class of society; thus it dictates\nthe etiquette practised at courts and the etiquette of the bar. The\ncharacteristics of the French journalist consist in a violent, but\nfrequently an eloquent and lofty, manner of discussing the politics\nof the day; and the exceptions to this habitual practice are only\noccasional. The characteristics of the American journalist consist in\nan open and coarse appeal to the passions of the populace; and he\nhabitually abandons the principles of political science to assail the\ncharacters of individuals, to track them into private life, and disclose\nall their weaknesses and errors.\n\nNothing can be more deplorable than this abuse of the powers of thought;\nI shall have occasion to point out hereafter the influence of the\nnewspapers upon the taste and the morality of the American people, but\nmy present subject exclusively concerns the political world. It cannot\nbe denied that the effects of this extreme license of the press tend\nindirectly to the maintenance of public order. The individuals who\nare already in the possession of a high station in the esteem of their\nfellow-citizens are afraid to write in the newspapers, and they are thus\ndeprived of the most powerful instrument which they can use to excite\nthe passions of the multitude to their own advantage. *a\n\n[Footnote a: They only write in the papers when they choose to address\nthe people in their own name; as, for instance, when they are called\nupon to repel calumnious imputations, and to correct a misstatement of\nfacts.]\n\nThe personal opinions of the editors have no kind of weight in the\neyes of the public: the only use of a journal is, that it imparts the\nknowledge of certain facts, and it is only by altering or distorting\nthose facts that a journalist can contribute to the support of his own\nviews.\n\nBut although the press is limited to these resources, its influence\nin America is immense. It is the power which impels the circulation of\npolitical life through all the districts of that vast territory. Its eye\nis constantly open to detect the secret springs of political designs,\nand to summon the leaders of all parties to the bar of public opinion.\nIt rallies the interests of the community round certain principles, and\nit draws up the creed which factions adopt; for it affords a means of\nintercourse between parties which hear, and which address each other\nwithout ever having been in immediate contact. When a great number of\nthe organs of the press adopt the same line of conduct, their influence\nbecomes irresistible; and public opinion, when it is perpetually\nassailed from the same side, eventually yields to the attack. In the\nUnited States each separate journal exercises but little authority, but\nthe power of the periodical press is only second to that of the people.\n*b\n\n[Footnote b: See Appendix, P.]\n\nThe opinions established in the United States under the empire of the\nliberty of the press are frequently more firmly rooted than those which\nare formed elsewhere under the sanction of a censor.\n\nIn the United States the democracy perpetually raises fresh individuals\nto the conduct of public affairs; and the measures of the administration\nare consequently seldom regulated by the strict rules of consistency or\nof order. But the general principles of the Government are more stable,\nand the opinions most prevalent in society are generally more durable\nthan in many other countries. When once the Americans have taken up an\nidea, whether it be well or ill founded, nothing is more difficult than\nto eradicate it from their minds. The same tenacity of opinion has been\nobserved in England, where, for the last century, greater freedom of\nconscience and more invincible prejudices have existed than in all the\nother countries of Europe. I attribute this consequence to a cause which\nmay at first sight appear to have a very opposite tendency, namely, to\nthe liberty of the press. The nations amongst which this liberty exists\nare as apt to cling to their opinions from pride as from conviction.\nThey cherish them because they hold them to be just, and because they\nexercised their own free-will in choosing them; and they maintain them\nnot only because they are true, but because they are their own. Several\nother reasons conduce to the same end.\n\nIt was remarked by a man of genius that \"ignorance lies at the two ends\nof knowledge.\" Perhaps it would have been more correct to have said,\nthat absolute convictions are to be met with at the two extremities, and\nthat doubt lies in the middle; for the human intellect may be considered\nin three distinct states, which frequently succeed one another. A man\nbelieves implicitly, because he adopts a proposition without inquiry. He\ndoubts as soon as he is assailed by the objections which his inquiries\nmay have aroused. But he frequently succeeds in satisfying these doubts,\nand then he begins to believe afresh: he no longer lays hold on a truth\nin its most shadowy and uncertain form, but he sees it clearly before\nhim, and he advances onwards by the light it gives him. *c\n\n[Footnote c: It may, however, be doubted whether this rational\nand self-guiding conviction arouses as much fervor or enthusiastic\ndevotedness in men as their first dogmatical belief.]\n\nWhen the liberty of the press acts upon men who are in the first of\nthese three states, it does not immediately disturb their habit of\nbelieving implicitly without investigation, but it constantly modifies\nthe objects of their intuitive convictions. The human mind continues\nto discern but one point upon the whole intellectual horizon, and\nthat point is in continual motion. Such are the symptoms of sudden\nrevolutions, and of the misfortunes which are sure to befall those\ngenerations which abruptly adopt the unconditional freedom of the press.\n\nThe circle of novel ideas is, however, soon terminated; the touch\nof experience is upon them, and the doubt and mistrust which their\nuncertainty produces become universal. We may rest assured that the\nmajority of mankind will either believe they know not wherefore, or will\nnot know what to believe. Few are the beings who can ever hope to\nattain to that state of rational and independent conviction which true\nknowledge can beget in defiance of the attacks of doubt.\n\nIt has been remarked that in times of great religious fervor men\nsometimes change their religious opinions; whereas in times of general\nscepticism everyone clings to his own persuasion. The same thing takes\nplace in politics under the liberty of the press. In countries where all\nthe theories of social science have been contested in their turn, the\ncitizens who have adopted one of them stick to it, not so much because\nthey are assured of its excellence, as because they are not convinced of\nthe superiority of any other. In the present age men are not very ready\nto die in defence of their opinions, but they are rarely inclined to\nchange them; and there are fewer martyrs as well as fewer apostates.\n\nAnother still more valid reason may yet be adduced: when no abstract\nopinions are looked upon as certain, men cling to the mere propensities\nand external interests of their position, which are naturally more\ntangible and more permanent than any opinions in the world.\n\nIt is not a question of easy solution whether aristocracy or democracy\nis most fit to govern a country. But it is certain that democracy annoys\none part of the community, and that aristocracy oppresses another part.\nWhen the question is reduced to the simple expression of the struggle\nbetween poverty and wealth, the tendency of each side of the dispute\nbecomes perfectly evident without further controversy.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XII: Political Associations In The United States\n\nChapter Summary\n\nDaily use which the Anglo-Americans make of the right of\nassociation--Three kinds of political associations--In what manner\nthe Americans apply the representative system to associations--Dangers\nresulting to the State--Great Convention of 1831 relative to the\nTariff--Legislative character of this Convention--Why the unlimited\nexercise of the right of association is less dangerous in the United\nStates than elsewhere--Why it may be looked upon as necessary--Utility\nof associations in a democratic people.\n\nPolitical Associations In The United States\n\nIn no country in the world has the principle of association been\nmore successfully used, or more unsparingly applied to a multitude of\ndifferent objects, than in America. Besides the permanent associations\nwhich are established by law under the names of townships, cities,\nand counties, a vast number of others are formed and maintained by the\nagency of private individuals.\n\nThe citizen of the United States is taught from his earliest infancy\nto rely upon his own exertions in order to resist the evils and the\ndifficulties of life; he looks upon social authority with an eye of\nmistrust and anxiety, and he only claims its assistance when he is quite\nunable to shift without it. This habit may even be traced in the schools\nof the rising generation, where the children in their games are wont to\nsubmit to rules which they have themselves established, and to punish\nmisdemeanors which they have themselves defined. The same spirit\npervades every act of social life. If a stoppage occurs in a\nthoroughfare, and the circulation of the public is hindered, the\nneighbors immediately constitute a deliberative body; and this\nextemporaneous assembly gives rise to an executive power which remedies\nthe inconvenience before anybody has thought of recurring to an\nauthority superior to that of the persons immediately concerned. If the\npublic pleasures are concerned, an association is formed to provide\nfor the splendor and the regularity of the entertainment. Societies are\nformed to resist enemies which are exclusively of a moral nature, and to\ndiminish the vice of intemperance: in the United States associations are\nestablished to promote public order, commerce, industry, morality, and\nreligion; for there is no end which the human will, seconded by the\ncollective exertions of individuals, despairs of attaining.\n\nI shall hereafter have occasion to show the effects of association upon\nthe course of society, and I must confine myself for the present to the\npolitical world. When once the right of association is recognized, the\ncitizens may employ it in several different ways.\n\nAn association consists simply in the public assent which a number of\nindividuals give to certain doctrines, and in the engagement which they\ncontract to promote the spread of those doctrines by their exertions.\nThe right of association with these views is very analogous to the\nliberty of unlicensed writing; but societies thus formed possess more\nauthority than the press. When an opinion is represented by a society,\nit necessarily assumes a more exact and explicit form. It numbers its\npartisans, and compromises their welfare in its cause: they, on the\nother hand, become acquainted with each other, and their zeal is\nincreased by their number. An association unites the efforts of minds\nwhich have a tendency to diverge in one single channel, and urges them\nvigorously towards one single end which it points out.\n\nThe second degree in the right of association is the power of meeting.\nWhen an association is allowed to establish centres of action at certain\nimportant points in the country, its activity is increased and its\ninfluence extended. Men have the opportunity of seeing each other; means\nof execution are more readily combined, and opinions are maintained with\na degree of warmth and energy which written language cannot approach.\n\nLastly, in the exercise of the right of political association, there\nis a third degree: the partisans of an opinion may unite in electoral\nbodies, and choose delegates to represent them in a central assembly.\nThis is, properly speaking, the application of the representative system\nto a party.\n\nThus, in the first instance, a society is formed between individuals\nprofessing the same opinion, and the tie which keeps it together is of\na purely intellectual nature; in the second case, small assemblies are\nformed which only represent a fraction of the party. Lastly, in the\nthird case, they constitute a separate nation in the midst of the\nnation, a government within the Government. Their delegates, like the\nreal delegates of the majority, represent the entire collective force\nof their party; and they enjoy a certain degree of that national dignity\nand great influence which belong to the chosen representatives of the\npeople. It is true that they have not the right of making the laws,\nbut they have the power of attacking those which are in being, and\nof drawing up beforehand those which they may afterwards cause to be\nadopted.\n\nIf, in a people which is imperfectly accustomed to the exercise\nof freedom, or which is exposed to violent political passions, a\ndeliberating minority, which confines itself to the contemplation of\nfuture laws, be placed in juxtaposition to the legislative majority, I\ncannot but believe that public tranquillity incurs very great risks in\nthat nation. There is doubtless a very wide difference between proving\nthat one law is in itself better than another and proving that the\nformer ought to be substituted for the latter. But the imagination\nof the populace is very apt to overlook this difference, which is so\napparent to the minds of thinking men. It sometimes happens that a\nnation is divided into two nearly equal parties, each of which affects\nto represent the majority. If, in immediate contiguity to the directing\npower, another power be established, which exercises almost as much\nmoral authority as the former, it is not to be believed that it will\nlong be content to speak without acting; or that it will always be\nrestrained by the abstract consideration of the nature of associations\nwhich are meant to direct but not to enforce opinions, to suggest but\nnot to make the laws.\n\nThe more we consider the independence of the press in its principal\nconsequences, the more are we convinced that it is the chief and, so to\nspeak, the constitutive element of freedom in the modern world. A nation\nwhich is determined to remain free is therefore right in demanding the\nunrestrained exercise of this independence. But the unrestrained liberty\nof political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty\nof the press. The one is at the same time less necessary and more\ndangerous than the other. A nation may confine it within certain limits\nwithout forfeiting any part of its self-control; and it may sometimes be\nobliged to do so in order to maintain its own authority.\n\nIn America the liberty of association for political purposes is\nunbounded. An example will show in the clearest light to what an extent\nthis privilege is tolerated.\n\nThe question of the tariff, or of free trade, produced a great\nmanifestation of party feeling in America; the tariff was not only a\nsubject of debate as a matter of opinion, but it exercised a favorable\nor a prejudicial influence upon several very powerful interests of the\nStates. The North attributed a great portion of its prosperity, and the\nSouth all its sufferings, to this system; insomuch that for a long\ntime the tariff was the sole source of the political animosities which\nagitated the Union.\n\nIn 1831, when the dispute was raging with the utmost virulence, a\nprivate citizen of Massachusetts proposed to all the enemies of the\ntariff, by means of the public prints, to send delegates to Philadelphia\nin order to consult together upon the means which were most fitted to\npromote freedom of trade. This proposal circulated in a few days from\nMaine to New Orleans by the power of the printing-press: the opponents\nof the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were formed on all\nsides, and delegates were named. The majority of these individuals\nwere well known, and some of them had earned a considerable degree of\ncelebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in\nthe same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On October 1, 1831, this\nassembly, which according to the American custom had taken the name of\na Convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than two hundred\nmembers. Its debates were public, and they at once assumed a legislative\ncharacter; the extent of the powers of Congress, the theories of free\ntrade, and the different clauses of the tariff, were discussed in turn.\nAt the end of ten days' deliberation the Convention broke up, after\nhaving published an address to the American people, in which it\ndeclared:\n\nI. That Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the\nexisting tariff was unconstitutional;\n\nII. That the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests\nof all nations, and to that of the American people in particular.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political\nassociation has not hitherto produced, in the United States, those fatal\nconsequences which might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. The\nright of association was imported from England, and it has always\nexisted in America; so that the exercise of this privilege is now\namalgamated with the manners and customs of the people. At the present\ntime the liberty of association is become a necessary guarantee against\nthe tyranny of the majority. In the United States, as soon as a party is\nbecome preponderant, all public authority passes under its control; its\nprivate supporters occupy all the places, and have all the force of the\nadministration at their disposal. As the most distinguished partisans\nof the other side of the question are unable to surmount the obstacles\nwhich exclude them from power, they require some means of establishing\nthemselves upon their own basis, and of opposing the moral authority\nof the minority to the physical power which domineers over it. Thus a\ndangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable danger.\n\nThe omnipotence of the majority appears to me to present such extreme\nperils to the American Republics that the dangerous measure which is\nused to repress it seems to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And\nhere I am about to advance a proposition which may remind the reader\nof what I said before in speaking of municipal freedom: There are\nno countries in which associations are more needed, to prevent the\ndespotism of faction or the arbitrary power of a prince, than those\nwhich are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations the\nbody of the nobles and the more opulent part of the community are in\nthemselves natural associations, which act as checks upon the abuses of\npower. In countries in which these associations do not exist, if\nprivate individuals are unable to create an artificial and a temporary\nsubstitute for them, I can imagine no permanent protection against the\nmost galling tyranny; and a great people may be oppressed by a small\nfaction, or by a single individual, with impunity.\n\nThe meeting of a great political Convention (for there are Conventions\nof all kinds), which may frequently become a necessary measure, is\nalways a serious occurrence, even in America, and one which is never\nlooked forward to, by the judicious friends of the country, without\nalarm. This was very perceptible in the Convention of 1831, at which the\nexertions of all the most distinguished members of the Assembly tended\nto moderate its language, and to restrain the subjects which it treated\nwithin certain limits. It is probable, in fact, that the Convention of\n1831 exercised a very great influence upon the minds of the malcontents,\nand prepared them for the open revolt against the commercial laws of the\nUnion which took place in 1832.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association\nfor political purposes is the privilege which a people is longest in\nlearning how to exercise. If it does not throw the nation into anarchy,\nit perpetually augments the chances of that calamity. On one point,\nhowever, this perilous liberty offers a security against dangers of\nanother kind; in countries where associations are free, secret\nsocieties are unknown. In America there are numerous factions, but no\nconspiracies.\n\nDifferent ways in which the right of association is understood in\nEurope and in the United States--Different use which is made of it.\n\nThe most natural privilege of man, next to the right of acting\nfor himself, is that of combining his exertions with those of his\nfellow-creatures, and of acting in common with them. I am therefore led\nto conclude that the right of association is almost as inalienable\nas the right of personal liberty. No legislator can attack it without\nimpairing the very foundations of society. Nevertheless, if the liberty\nof association is a fruitful source of advantages and prosperity to some\nnations, it may be perverted or carried to excess by others, and\nthe element of life may be changed into an element of destruction. A\ncomparison of the different methods which associations pursue in those\ncountries in which they are managed with discretion, as well as in those\nwhere liberty degenerates into license, may perhaps be thought useful\nboth to governments and to parties.\n\nThe greater part of Europeans look upon an association as a weapon which\nis to be hastily fashioned, and immediately tried in the conflict.\nA society is formed for discussion, but the idea of impending action\nprevails in the minds of those who constitute it: it is, in fact, an\narmy; and the time given to parley serves to reckon up the strength and\nto animate the courage of the host, after which they direct their march\nagainst the enemy. Resources which lie within the bounds of the law may\nsuggest themselves to the persons who compose it as means, but never as\nthe only means, of success.\n\nSuch, however, is not the manner in which the right of association is\nunderstood in the United States. In America the citizens who form\nthe minority associate, in order, in the first place, to show their\nnumerical strength, and so to diminish the moral authority of the\nmajority; and, in the second place, to stimulate competition, and to\ndiscover those arguments which are most fitted to act upon the majority;\nfor they always entertain hopes of drawing over their opponents to their\nown side, and of afterwards disposing of the supreme power in their\nname. Political associations in the United States are therefore\npeaceable in their intentions, and strictly legal in the means which\nthey employ; and they assert with perfect truth that they only aim at\nsuccess by lawful expedients.\n\nThe difference which exists between the Americans and ourselves depends\non several causes. In Europe there are numerous parties so diametrically\nopposed to the majority that they can never hope to acquire its support,\nand at the same time they think that they are sufficiently strong in\nthemselves to struggle and to defend their cause. When a party of this\nkind forms an association, its object is, not to conquer, but to fight.\nIn America the individuals who hold opinions very much opposed to those\nof the majority are no sort of impediment to its power, and all other\nparties hope to win it over to their own principles in the end. The\nexercise of the right of association becomes dangerous in proportion\nto the impossibility which excludes great parties from acquiring the\nmajority. In a country like the United States, in which the differences\nof opinion are mere differences of hue, the right of association may\nremain unrestrained without evil consequences. The inexperience of many\nof the European nations in the enjoyment of liberty leads them only\nto look upon the liberty of association as a right of attacking the\nGovernment. The first notion which presents itself to a party, as well\nas to an individual, when it has acquired a consciousness of its own\nstrength, is that of violence: the notion of persuasion arises at a\nlater period and is only derived from experience. The English, who are\ndivided into parties which differ most essentially from each other,\nrarely abuse the right of association, because they have long been\naccustomed to exercise it. In France the passion for war is so intense\nthat there is no undertaking so mad, or so injurious to the welfare of\nthe State, that a man does not consider himself honored in defending it,\nat the risk of his life.\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful of the causes which tend to mitigate the\nexcesses of political association in the United States is Universal\nSuffrage. In countries in which universal suffrage exists the majority\nis never doubtful, because neither party can pretend to represent that\nportion of the community which has not voted. The associations which\nare formed are aware, as well as the nation at large, that they do not\nrepresent the majority: this is, indeed, a condition inseparable from\ntheir existence; for if they did represent the preponderating power,\nthey would change the law instead of soliciting its reform. The\nconsequence of this is that the moral influence of the Government which\nthey attack is very much increased, and their own power is very much\nenfeebled.\n\nIn Europe there are few associations which do not affect to represent\nthe majority, or which do not believe that they represent it. This\nconviction or this pretension tends to augment their force amazingly,\nand contributes no less to legalize their measures. Violence may seem to\nbe excusable in defence of the cause of oppressed right. Thus it is,\nin the vast labyrinth of human laws, that extreme liberty sometimes\ncorrects the abuses of license, and that extreme democracy obviates\nthe dangers of democratic government. In Europe, associations consider\nthemselves, in some degree, as the legislative and executive councils of\nthe people, which is unable to speak for itself. In America, where they\nonly represent a minority of the nation, they argue and they petition.\n\nThe means which the associations of Europe employ are in accordance\nwith the end which they propose to obtain. As the principal aim of these\nbodies is to act, and not to debate, to fight rather than to persuade,\nthey are naturally led to adopt a form of organization which differs\nfrom the ordinary customs of civil bodies, and which assumes the habits\nand the maxims of military life. They centralize the direction of their\nresources as much as possible, and they intrust the power of the whole\nparty to a very small number of leaders.\n\nThe members of these associations respond to a watchword, like soldiers\non duty; they profess the doctrine of passive obedience; say rather,\nthat in uniting together they at once abjure the exercise of their own\njudgment and free will; and the tyrannical control which these societies\nexercise is often far more insupportable than the authority possessed\nover society by the Government which they attack. Their moral force is\nmuch diminished by these excesses, and they lose the powerful interest\nwhich is always excited by a struggle between oppressors and the\noppressed. The man who in given cases consents to obey his fellows with\nservility, and who submits his activity and even his opinions to their\ncontrol, can have no claim to rank as a free citizen.\n\nThe Americans have also established certain forms of government which\nare applied to their associations, but these are invariably borrowed\nfrom the forms of the civil administration. The independence of each\nindividual is formally recognized; the tendency of the members of the\nassociation points, as it does in the body of the community, towards\nthe same end, but they are not obliged to follow the same track. No\none abjures the exercise of his reason and his free will; but every\none exerts that reason and that will for the benefit of a common\nundertaking.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America--Part I\n\nI am well aware of the difficulties which attend this part of my\nsubject, but although every expression which I am about to make use of\nmay clash, upon some one point, with the feelings of the different\nparties which divide my country, I shall speak my opinion with the most\nperfect openness.\n\nIn Europe we are at a loss how to judge the true character and the more\npermanent propensities of democracy, because in Europe two conflicting\nprinciples exist, and we do not know what to attribute to the principles\nthemselves, and what to refer to the passions which they bring into\ncollision. Such, however, is not the case in America; there the people\nreigns without any obstacle, and it has no perils to dread and no\ninjuries to avenge. In America, democracy is swayed by its own free\npropensities; its course is natural and its activity is unrestrained;\nthe United States consequently afford the most favorable opportunity of\nstudying its real character. And to no people can this inquiry be more\nvitally interesting than to the French nation, which is blindly driven\nonwards by a daily and irresistible impulse towards a state of things\nwhich may prove either despotic or republican, but which will assuredly\nbe democratic.\n\nUniversal Suffrage\n\nI have already observed that universal suffrage has been adopted in\nall the States of the Union; it consequently occurs amongst different\npopulations which occupy very different positions in the scale of\nsociety. I have had opportunities of observing its effects in different\nlocalities, and amongst races of men who are nearly strangers to each\nother by their language, their religion, and their manner of life; in\nLouisiana as well as in New England, in Georgia and in Canada. I have\nremarked that Universal Suffrage is far from producing in America either\nall the good or all the evil consequences which are assigned to it in\nEurope, and that its effects differ very widely from those which are\nusually attributed to it.\n\nChoice Of The People, And Instinctive Preferences Of The American\nDemocracy\n\nIn the United States the most able men are rarely placed at the head\nof affairs--Reason of this peculiarity--The envy which prevails in the\nlower orders of France against the higher classes is not a French, but a\npurely democratic sentiment--For what reason the most distinguished men\nin America frequently seclude themselves from public affairs.\n\nMany people in Europe are apt to believe without saying it, or to say\nwithout believing it, that one of the great advantages of universal\nsuffrage is, that it entrusts the direction of public affairs to men\nwho are worthy of the public confidence. They admit that the people is\nunable to govern for itself, but they aver that it is always sincerely\ndisposed to promote the welfare of the State, and that it instinctively\ndesignates those persons who are animated by the same good wishes, and\nwho are the most fit to wield the supreme authority. I confess that the\nobservations I made in America by no means coincide with these opinions.\nOn my arrival in the United States I was surprised to find so much\ndistinguished talent among the subjects, and so little among the heads\nof the Government. It is a well-authenticated fact, that at the present\nday the most able men in the United States are very rarely placed at\nthe head of affairs; and it must be acknowledged that such has been the\nresult in proportion as democracy has outstepped all its former limits.\nThe race of American statesmen has evidently dwindled most remarkably in\nthe course of the last fifty years.\n\nSeveral causes may be assigned to this phenomenon. It is impossible,\nnotwithstanding the most strenuous exertions, to raise the intelligence\nof the people above a certain level. Whatever may be the facilities of\nacquiring information, whatever may be the profusion of easy methods and\nof cheap science, the human mind can never be instructed and educated\nwithout devoting a considerable space of time to those objects.\n\nThe greater or the lesser possibility of subsisting without labor is\ntherefore the necessary boundary of intellectual improvement. This\nboundary is more remote in some countries and more restricted in others;\nbut it must exist somewhere as long as the people is constrained to work\nin order to procure the means of physical subsistence, that is to say,\nas long as it retains its popular character. It is therefore quite as\ndifficult to imagine a State in which all the citizens should be very\nwell informed as a State in which they should all be wealthy; these two\ndifficulties may be looked upon as correlative. It may very readily be\nadmitted that the mass of the citizens are sincerely disposed to promote\nthe welfare of their country; nay more, it may even be allowed that the\nlower classes are less apt to be swayed by considerations of personal\ninterest than the higher orders: but it is always more or less\nimpossible for them to discern the best means of attaining the end which\nthey desire with sincerity. Long and patient observation, joined to a\nmultitude of different notions, is required to form a just estimate of\nthe character of a single individual; and can it be supposed that the\nvulgar have the power of succeeding in an inquiry which misleads the\npenetration of genius itself? The people has neither the time nor the\nmeans which are essential to the prosecution of an investigation of this\nkind: its conclusions are hastily formed from a superficial inspection\nof the more prominent features of a question. Hence it often assents\nto the clamor of a mountebank who knows the secret of stimulating its\ntastes, while its truest friends frequently fail in their exertions.\n\nMoreover, the democracy is not only deficient in that soundness of\njudgment which is necessary to select men really deserving of its\nconfidence, but it has neither the desire nor the inclination to find\nthem out. It cannot be denied that democratic institutions have a very\nstrong tendency to promote the feeling of envy in the human heart; not\nso much because they afford to every one the means of rising to the\nlevel of any of his fellow-citizens, as because those means perpetually\ndisappoint the persons who employ them. Democratic institutions awaken\nand foster a passion for equality which they can never entirely satisfy.\nThis complete equality eludes the grasp of the people at the very moment\nat which it thinks to hold it fast, and \"flies,\" as Pascal says, \"with\neternal flight\"; the people is excited in the pursuit of an advantage,\nwhich is more precious because it is not sufficiently remote to be\nunknown, or sufficiently near to be enjoyed. The lower orders\nare agitated by the chance of success, they are irritated by its\nuncertainty; and they pass from the enthusiasm of pursuit to the\nexhaustion of ill-success, and lastly to the acrimony of disappointment.\nWhatever transcends their own limits appears to be an obstacle to their\ndesires, and there is no kind of superiority, however legitimate it may\nbe, which is not irksome in their sight.\n\nIt has been supposed that the secret instinct which leads the lower\norders to remove their superiors as much as possible from the direction\nof public affairs is peculiar to France. This, however, is an error; the\npropensity to which I allude is not inherent in any particular nation,\nbut in democratic institutions in general; and although it may have been\nheightened by peculiar political circumstances, it owes its origin to a\nhigher cause.\n\nIn the United States the people is not disposed to hate the superior\nclasses of society; but it is not very favorably inclined towards them,\nand it carefully excludes them from the exercise of authority. It does\nnot entertain any dread of distinguished talents, but it is rarely\ncaptivated by them; and it awards its approbation very sparingly to such\nas have risen without the popular support.\n\nWhilst the natural propensities of democracy induce the people to reject\nthe most distinguished citizens as its rulers, these individuals are\nno less apt to retire from a political career in which it is almost\nimpossible to retain their independence, or to advance without degrading\nthemselves. This opinion has been very candidly set forth by Chancellor\nKent, who says, in speaking with great eulogiums of that part of the\nConstitution which empowers the Executive to nominate the judges: \"It is\nindeed probable that the men who are best fitted to discharge the duties\nof this high office would have too much reserve in their manners, and\ntoo much austerity in their principles, for them to be returned by the\nmajority at an election where universal suffrage is adopted.\" Such were\nthe opinions which were printed without contradiction in America in the\nyear 1830!\n\nI hold it to be sufficiently demonstrated that universal suffrage is\nby no means a guarantee of the wisdom of the popular choice, and that,\nwhatever its advantages may be, this is not one of them.\n\n\nCauses Which May Partly Correct These Tendencies Of The Democracy\nContrary effects produced on peoples as well as on individuals by great\ndangers--Why so many distinguished men stood at the head of affairs\nin America fifty years ago--Influence which the intelligence and\nthe manners of the people exercise upon its choice--Example of New\nEngland--States of the Southwest--Influence of certain laws upon the\nchoice of the people--Election by an elected body--Its effects upon the\ncomposition of the Senate.\n\nWhen a State is threatened by serious dangers, the people frequently\nsucceeds in selecting the citizens who are the most able to save it.\nIt has been observed that man rarely retains his customary level in\npresence of very critical circumstances; he rises above or he sinks\nbelow his usual condition, and the same thing occurs in nations at\nlarge. Extreme perils sometimes quench the energy of a people instead of\nstimulating it; they excite without directing its passions, and instead\nof clearing they confuse its powers of perception. The Jews deluged the\nsmoking ruins of their temple with the carnage of the remnant of their\nhost. But it is more common, both in the case of nations and in that\nof individuals, to find extraordinary virtues arising from the very\nimminence of the danger. Great characters are then thrown into relief,\nas edifices which are concealed by the gloom of night are illuminated by\nthe glare of a conflagration. At those dangerous times genius no longer\nabstains from presenting itself in the arena; and the people, alarmed\nby the perils of its situation, buries its envious passions in a short\noblivion. Great names may then be drawn from the balloting-box.\n\nI have already observed that the American statesmen of the present day\nare very inferior to those who stood at the head of affairs fifty years\nago. This is as much a consequence of the circumstances as of the\nlaws of the country. When America was struggling in the high cause of\nindependence to throw off the yoke of another country, and when it\nwas about to usher a new nation into the world, the spirits of its\ninhabitants were roused to the height which their great efforts\nrequired. In this general excitement the most distinguished men were\nready to forestall the wants of the community, and the people clung\nto them for support, and placed them at its head. But events of this\nmagnitude are rare, and it is from an inspection of the ordinary course\nof affairs that our judgment must be formed.\n\nIf passing occurrences sometimes act as checks upon the passions of\ndemocracy, the intelligence and the manners of the community exercise\nan influence which is not less powerful and far more permanent. This is\nextremely perceptible in the United States.\n\nIn New England the education and the liberties of the communities were\nengendered by the moral and religious principles of their founders.\nWhere society has acquired a sufficient degree of stability to enable it\nto hold certain maxims and to retain fixed habits, the lower orders\nare accustomed to respect intellectual superiority and to submit to\nit without complaint, although they set at naught all those privileges\nwhich wealth and birth have introduced among mankind. The democracy\nin New England consequently makes a more judicious choice than it does\nelsewhere.\n\nBut as we descend towards the South, to those States in which\nthe constitution of society is more modern and less strong, where\ninstruction is less general, and where the principles of morality, of\nreligion, and of liberty are less happily combined, we perceive that the\ntalents and the virtues of those who are in authority become more and\nmore rare.\n\nLastly, when we arrive at the new South-western States, in which the\nconstitution of society dates but from yesterday, and presents an\nagglomeration of adventurers and speculators, we are amazed at the\npersons who are invested with public authority, and we are led to ask by\nwhat force, independent of the legislation and of the men who direct it,\nthe State can be protected, and society be made to flourish.\n\nThere are certain laws of a democratic nature which contribute,\nnevertheless, to correct, in some measure, the dangerous tendencies of\ndemocracy. On entering the House of Representatives of Washington one is\nstruck by the vulgar demeanor of that great assembly. The eye frequently\ndoes not discover a man of celebrity within its walls. Its members are\nalmost all obscure individuals whose names present no associations to\nthe mind: they are mostly village lawyers, men in trade, or even\npersons belonging to the lower classes of society. In a country in which\neducation is very general, it is said that the representatives of the\npeople do not always know how to write correctly.\n\nAt a few yards' distance from this spot is the door of the Senate, which\ncontains within a small space a large proportion of the celebrated men\nof America. Scarcely an individual is to be perceived in it who does\nnot recall the idea of an active and illustrious career: the Senate\nis composed of eloquent advocates, distinguished generals, wise\nmagistrates, and statesmen of note, whose language would at all times do\nhonor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates of Europe.\n\nWhat then is the cause of this strange contrast, and why are the most\nable citizens to be found in one assembly rather than in the other?\nWhy is the former body remarkable for its vulgarity and its poverty of\ntalent, whilst the latter seems to enjoy a monopoly of intelligence and\nof sound judgment? Both of these assemblies emanate from the people;\nboth of them are chosen by universal suffrage; and no voice has hitherto\nbeen heard to assert in America that the Senate is hostile to the\ninterests of the people. From what cause, then, does so startling a\ndifference arise? The only reason which appears to me adequately to\naccount for it is, that the House of Representatives is elected by the\npopulace directly, and that the Senate is elected by elected bodies. The\nwhole body of the citizens names the legislature of each State, and the\nFederal Constitution converts these legislatures into so many electoral\nbodies, which return the members of the Senate. The senators are elected\nby an indirect application of universal suffrage; for the legislatures\nwhich name them are not aristocratic or privileged bodies which exercise\nthe electoral franchise in their own right; but they are chosen by the\ntotality of the citizens; they are generally elected every year, and new\nmembers may constantly be chosen who will employ their electoral rights\nin conformity with the wishes of the public. But this transmission of\nthe popular authority through an assembly of chosen men operates an\nimportant change in it, by refining its discretion and improving the\nforms which it adopts. Men who are chosen in this manner accurately\nrepresent the majority of the nation which governs them; but they\nrepresent the elevated thoughts which are current in the community,\nthe propensities which prompt its nobler actions, rather than the petty\npassions which disturb or the vices which disgrace it.\n\nThe time may be already anticipated at which the American Republics will\nbe obliged to introduce the plan of election by an elected body more\nfrequently into their system of representation, or they will incur no\nsmall risk of perishing miserably amongst the shoals of democracy.\n\nAnd here I have no scruple in confessing that I look upon this peculiar\nsystem of election as the only means of bringing the exercise of\npolitical power to the level of all classes of the people. Those\nthinkers who regard this institution as the exclusive weapon of a party,\nand those who fear, on the other hand, to make use of it, seem to me to\nfall into as great an error in the one case as in the other.\n\nInfluence Which The American Democracy Has Exercised On The Laws\nRelating To Elections\n\nWhen elections are rare, they expose the State to a violent crisis--When\nthey are frequent, they keep up a degree of feverish excitement--The\nAmericans have preferred the second of these two evils--Mutability of\nthe laws--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson on this subject.\n\nWhen elections recur at long intervals the State is exposed to violent\nagitation every time they take place. Parties exert themselves to the\nutmost in order to gain a prize which is so rarely within their reach;\nand as the evil is almost irremediable for the candidates who fail, the\nconsequences of their disappointed ambition may prove most disastrous;\nif, on the other hand, the legal struggle can be repeated within a short\nspace of time, the defeated parties take patience. When elections occur\nfrequently, their recurrence keeps society in a perpetual state of\nfeverish excitement, and imparts a continual instability to public\naffairs.\n\n\nThus, on the one hand the State is exposed to the perils of a\nrevolution, on the other to perpetual mutability; the former system\nthreatens the very existence of the Government, the latter is an\nobstacle to all steady and consistent policy. The Americans have\npreferred the second of these evils to the first; but they were led to\nthis conclusion by their instinct much more than by their reason; for a\ntaste for variety is one of the characteristic passions of democracy. An\nextraordinary mutability has, by this means, been introduced into their\nlegislation. Many of the Americans consider the instability of their\nlaws as a necessary consequence of a system whose general results are\nbeneficial. But no one in the United States affects to deny the fact of\nthis instability, or to contend that it is not a great evil.\n\nHamilton, after having demonstrated the utility of a power which might\nprevent, or which might at least impede, the promulgation of bad laws,\nadds: \"It might perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws\nincludes that of preventing good ones, and may be used to the one\npurpose as well as to the other. But this objection will have little\nweight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that\ninconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish\nin the character and genius of our governments.\" (Federalist, No. 73.)\nAnd again in No. 62 of the same work he observes: \"The facility and\nexcess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our governments\nare most liable. . . . The mischievous effects of the mutability in the\npublic councils arising from a rapid succession of new members would\nfill a volume: every new election in the States is found to change\none-half of the representatives. From this change of men must proceed\na change of opinions and of measures, which forfeits the respect and\nconfidence of other nations, poisons the blessings of liberty itself,\nand diminishes the attachment and reverence of the people toward a\npolitical system which betrays so many marks of infirmity.\"\n\nJefferson himself, the greatest Democrat whom the democracy of America\nhas yet produced, pointed out the same evils. \"The instability of\nour laws,\" said he in a letter to Madison, \"is really a very serious\ninconvenience. I think that we ought to have obviated it by deciding\nthat a whole year should always be allowed to elapse between the\nbringing in of a bill and the final passing of it. It should afterward\nbe discussed and put to the vote without the possibility of making any\nalteration in it; and if the circumstances of the case required a\nmore speedy decision, the question should not be decided by a simple\nmajority, but by a majority of at least two-thirds of both houses.\"\n\nPublic Officers Under The Control Of The Democracy In America Simple\nexterior of the American public officers--No official costume--All\npublic officers are remunerated--Political consequences of this\nsystem--No public career exists in America--Result of this.\n\nPublic officers in the United States are commingled with the crowd\nof citizens; they have neither palaces, nor guards, nor ceremonial\ncostumes. This simple exterior of the persons in authority is connected\nnot only with the peculiarities of the American character, but with\nthe fundamental principles of that society. In the estimation of the\ndemocracy a government is not a benefit, but a necessary evil. A certain\ndegree of power must be granted to public officers, for they would be\nof no use without it. But the ostensible semblance of authority is by\nno means indispensable to the conduct of affairs, and it is needlessly\noffensive to the susceptibility of the public. The public officers\nthemselves are well aware that they only enjoy the superiority over\ntheir fellow-citizens which they derive from their authority upon\ncondition of putting themselves on a level with the whole community by\ntheir manners. A public officer in the United States is uniformly civil,\naccessible to all the world, attentive to all requests, and obliging\nin his replies. I was pleased by these characteristics of a democratic\ngovernment; and I was struck by the manly independence of the citizens,\nwho respect the office more than the officer, and who are less attached\nto the emblems of authority than to the man who bears them.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the influence which costumes really\nexercise, in an age like that in which we live, has been a good deal\nexaggerated. I never perceived that a public officer in America was the\nless respected whilst he was in the discharge of his duties because his\nown merit was set off by no adventitious signs. On the other hand, it is\nvery doubtful whether a peculiar dress contributes to the respect which\npublic characters ought to have for their own position, at least when\nthey are not otherwise inclined to respect it. When a magistrate (and\nin France such instances are not rare) indulges his trivial wit at the\nexpense of the prisoner, or derides the predicament in which a culprit\nis placed, it would be well to deprive him of his robes of office,\nto see whether he would recall some portion of the natural dignity of\nmankind when he is reduced to the apparel of a private citizen.\n\nA democracy may, however, allow a certain show of magisterial pomp, and\nclothe its officers in silks and gold, without seriously compromising\nits principles. Privileges of this kind are transitory; they belong to\nthe place, and are distinct from the individual: but if public officers\nare not uniformly remunerated by the State, the public charges must be\nentrusted to men of opulence and independence, who constitute the\nbasis of an aristocracy; and if the people still retains its right\nof election, that election can only be made from a certain class of\ncitizens. When a democratic republic renders offices which had formerly\nbeen remunerated gratuitous, it may safely be believed that the State\nis advancing to monarchical institutions; and when a monarchy begins to\nremunerate such officers as had hitherto been unpaid, it is a sure\nsign that it is approaching toward a despotic or a republican form of\ngovernment. The substitution of paid for unpaid functionaries is of\nitself, in my opinion, sufficient to constitute a serious revolution.\n\nI look upon the entire absence of gratuitous functionaries in America as\none of the most prominent signs of the absolute dominion which democracy\nexercises in that country. All public services, of whatsoever nature\nthey may be, are paid; so that every one has not merely the right, but\nalso the means of performing them. Although, in democratic States, all\nthe citizens are qualified to occupy stations in the Government, all\nare not tempted to try for them. The number and the capacities of the\ncandidates are more apt to restrict the choice of electors than the\nconnections of the candidateship.\n\nIn nations in which the principle of election extends to every place in\nthe State no political career can, properly speaking, be said to exist.\nMen are promoted as if by chance to the rank which they enjoy, and\nthey are by no means sure of retaining it. The consequence is that in\ntranquil times public functions offer but few lures to ambition. In the\nUnited States the persons who engage in the perplexities of political\nlife are individuals of very moderate pretensions. The pursuit of wealth\ngenerally diverts men of great talents and of great passions from the\npursuit of power, and it very frequently happens that a man does not\nundertake to direct the fortune of the State until he has discovered\nhis incompetence to conduct his own affairs. The vast number of very\nordinary men who occupy public stations is quite as attributable to\nthese causes as to the bad choice of the democracy. In the United\nStates, I am not sure that the people would return the men of superior\nabilities who might solicit its support, but it is certain that men of\nthis description do not come forward.\n\nArbitrary Power Of Magistrates Under The Rule Of The American Democracy\n\nFor what reason the arbitrary power of Magistrates is greater in\nabsolute monarchies and in democratic republics than it is in limited\nmonarchies--Arbitrary power of the Magistrates in New England.\n\nIn two different kinds of government the magistrates *a exercise a\nconsiderable degree of arbitrary power; namely, under the absolute\ngovernment of a single individual, and under that of a democracy. This\nidentical result proceeds from causes which are nearly analogous.\n\n[Footnote a: I here use the word magistrates in the widest sense in\nwhich it can be taken; I apply it to all the officers to whom the\nexecution of the laws is intrusted.]\n\nIn despotic States the fortune of no citizen is secure; and public\nofficers are not more safe than private individuals. The sovereign, who\nhas under his control the lives, the property, and sometimes the honor\nof the men whom he employs, does not scruple to allow them a great\nlatitude of action, because he is convinced that they will not use it\nto his prejudice. In despotic States the sovereign is so attached to the\nexercise of his power, that he dislikes the constraint even of his own\nregulations; and he is well pleased that his agents should follow a\nsomewhat fortuitous line of conduct, provided he be certain that their\nactions will never counteract his desires.\n\nIn democracies, as the majority has every year the right of depriving\nthe officers whom it has appointed of their power, it has no reason\nto fear any abuse of their authority. As the people is always able\nto signify its wishes to those who conduct the Government, it prefers\nleaving them to make their own exertions to prescribing an invariable\nrule of conduct which would at once fetter their activity and the\npopular authority.\n\nIt may even be observed, on attentive consideration, that under the\nrule of a democracy the arbitrary power of the magistrate must be still\ngreater than in despotic States. In the latter the sovereign has the\npower of punishing all the faults with which he becomes acquainted, but\nit would be vain for him to hope to become acquainted with all those\nwhich are committed. In the former the sovereign power is not only\nsupreme, but it is universally present. The American functionaries are,\nin point of fact, much more independent in the sphere of action which\nthe law traces out for them than any public officer in Europe. Very\nfrequently the object which they are to accomplish is simply pointed out\nto them, and the choice of the means is left to their own discretion.\n\nIn New England, for instance, the selectmen of each township are bound\nto draw up the list of persons who are to serve on the jury; the only\nrule which is laid down to guide them in their choice is that they are\nto select citizens possessing the elective franchise and enjoying a fair\nreputation. *b In France the lives and liberties of the subjects would\nbe thought to be in danger if a public officer of any kind was entrusted\nwith so formidable a right. In New England the same magistrates are\nempowered to post the names of habitual drunkards in public-houses, and\nto prohibit the inhabitants of a town from supplying them with liquor.\n*c A censorial power of this excessive kind would be revolting to\nthe population of the most absolute monarchies; here, however, it is\nsubmitted to without difficulty.\n\n[Footnote b: See the Act of February 27, 1813. \"General Collection of\nthe Laws of Massachusetts,\" vol. ii. p. 331. It should be added that the\njurors are afterwards drawn from these lists by lot.]\n\n[Footnote c: See Act of February 28, 1787. \"General Collection of the\nLaws of Massachusetts,\" vol. i. p. 302.]\n\nNowhere has so much been left by the law to the arbitrary determination\nof the magistrate as in democratic republics, because this arbitrary\npower is unattended by any alarming consequences. It may even be\nasserted that the freedom of the magistrate increases as the elective\nfranchise is extended, and as the duration of the time of office\nis shortened. Hence arises the great difficulty which attends the\nconversion of a democratic republic into a monarchy. The magistrate\nceases to be elective, but he retains the rights and the habits of an\nelected officer, which lead directly to despotism.\n\nIt is only in limited monarchies that the law, which prescribes the\nsphere in which public officers are to act, superintends all their\nmeasures. The cause of this may be easily detected. In limited\nmonarchies the power is divided between the King and the people, both\nof whom are interested in the stability of the magistrate. The King\ndoes not venture to place the public officers under the control of the\npeople, lest they should be tempted to betray his interests; on the\nother hand, the people fears lest the magistrates should serve to\noppress the liberties of the country, if they were entirely dependent\nupon the Crown; they cannot therefore be said to depend on either one\nor the other. The same cause which induces the king and the people\nto render public officers independent suggests the necessity of such\nsecurities as may prevent their independence from encroaching upon\nthe authority of the former and the liberties of the latter. They\nconsequently agree as to the necessity of restricting the functionary\nto a line of conduct laid down beforehand, and they are interested in\nconfining him by certain regulations which he cannot evade.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America--Part II\n\nInstability Of The Administration In The United States\n\nIn America the public acts of a community frequently leave fewer\ntraces than the occurrences of a family--Newspapers the only historical\nremains--Instability of the administration prejudicial to the art of\ngovernment.\n\nThe authority which public men possess in America is so brief, and they\nare so soon commingled with the ever-changing population of the country,\nthat the acts of a community frequently leave fewer traces than the\noccurrences of a private family. The public administration is, so to\nspeak, oral and traditionary. But little is committed to writing, and\nthat little is wafted away forever, like the leaves of the Sibyl, by the\nsmallest breeze.\n\nThe only historical remains in the United States are the newspapers; but\nif a number be wanting, the chain of time is broken, and the present\nis severed from the past. I am convinced that in fifty years it will\nbe more difficult to collect authentic documents concerning the social\ncondition of the Americans at the present day than it is to find remains\nof the administration of France during the Middle Ages; and if the\nUnited States were ever invaded by barbarians, it would be necessary to\nhave recourse to the history of other nations in order to learn anything\nof the people which now inhabits them.\n\nThe instability of the administration has penetrated into the habits of\nthe people: it even appears to suit the general taste, and no one cares\nfor what occurred before his time. No methodical system is pursued; no\narchives are formed; and no documents are brought together when it would\nbe very easy to do so. Where they exist, little store is set upon them;\nand I have amongst my papers several original public documents which\nwere given to me in answer to some of my inquiries. In America\nsociety seems to live from hand to mouth, like an army in the field.\nNevertheless, the art of administration may undoubtedly be ranked as\na science, and no sciences can be improved if the discoveries and\nobservations of successive generations are not connected together in\nthe order in which they occur. One man, in the short space of his life\nremarks a fact; another conceives an idea; the former invents a means\nof execution, the latter reduces a truth to a fixed proposition; and\nmankind gathers the fruits of individual experience upon its way\nand gradually forms the sciences. But the persons who conduct the\nadministration in America can seldom afford any instruction to each\nother; and when they assume the direction of society, they simply\npossess those attainments which are most widely disseminated in the\ncommunity, and no experience peculiar to themselves. Democracy,\ncarried to its furthest limits, is therefore prejudicial to the art of\ngovernment; and for this reason it is better adapted to a people already\nversed in the conduct of an administration than to a nation which is\nuninitiated in public affairs.\n\nThis remark, indeed, is not exclusively applicable to the science of\nadministration. Although a democratic government is founded upon a very\nsimple and natural principle, it always presupposes the existence of\na high degree of culture and enlightenment in society. *d At the first\nglance it may be imagined to belong to the earliest ages of the world;\nbut maturer observation will convince us that it could only come last in\nthe succession of human history.\n\n[Footnote d: It is needless to observe that I speak here of the\ndemocratic form of government as applied to a people, not merely to a\ntribe.]\n\nCharges Levied By The State Under The Rule Of The American Democracy\n\nIn all communities citizens divisible into three classes--Habits of\neach of these classes in the direction of public finances--Why public\nexpenditure must tend to increase when the people governs--What renders\nthe extravagance of a democracy less to be feared in America--Public\nexpenditure under a democracy.\n\nBefore we can affirm whether a democratic form of government is\neconomical or not, we must establish a suitable standard of comparison.\nThe question would be one of easy solution if we were to attempt to draw\na parallel between a democratic republic and an absolute monarchy. The\npublic expenditure would be found to be more considerable under the\nformer than under the latter; such is the case with all free States\ncompared to those which are not so. It is certain that despotism ruins\nindividuals by preventing them from producing wealth, much more than by\ndepriving them of the wealth they have produced; it dries up the source\nof riches, whilst it usually respects acquired property. Freedom, on the\ncontrary, engenders far more benefits than it destroys; and the nations\nwhich are favored by free institutions invariably find that their\nresources increase even more rapidly than their taxes.\n\nMy present object is to compare free nations to each other, and to point\nout the influence of democracy upon the finances of a State.\n\nCommunities, as well as organic bodies, are subject to certain fixed\nrules in their formation which they cannot evade. They are composed of\ncertain elements which are common to them at all times and under all\ncircumstances. The people may always be mentally divided into three\ndistinct classes. The first of these classes consists of the wealthy;\nthe second, of those who are in easy circumstances; and the third is\ncomposed of those who have little or no property, and who subsist more\nespecially by the work which they perform for the two superior orders.\nThe proportion of the individuals who are included in these three\ndivisions may vary according to the condition of society, but the\ndivisions themselves can never be obliterated.\n\nIt is evident that each of these classes will exercise an influence\npeculiar to its own propensities upon the administration of the finances\nof the State. If the first of the three exclusively possesses the\nlegislative power, it is probable that it will not be sparing of the\npublic funds, because the taxes which are levied on a large fortune only\ntend to diminish the sum of superfluous enjoyment, and are, in point of\nfact, but little felt. If the second class has the power of making the\nlaws, it will certainly not be lavish of taxes, because nothing is\nso onerous as a large impost which is levied upon a small income.\nThe government of the middle classes appears to me to be the most\neconomical, though perhaps not the most enlightened, and certainly not\nthe most generous, of free governments.\n\nBut let us now suppose that the legislative authority is vested in\nthe lowest orders: there are two striking reasons which show that the\ntendency of the expenditure will be to increase, not to diminish. As the\ngreat majority of those who create the laws are possessed of no property\nupon which taxes can be imposed, all the money which is spent for the\ncommunity appears to be spent to their advantage, at no cost of their\nown; and those who are possessed of some little property readily find\nmeans of regulating the taxes so that they are burdensome to the wealthy\nand profitable to the poor, although the rich are unable to take the\nsame advantage when they are in possession of the Government.\n\nIn countries in which the poor *e should be exclusively invested with\nthe power of making the laws no great economy of public expenditure\nought to be expected: that expenditure will always be considerable;\neither because the taxes do not weigh upon those who levy them, or\nbecause they are levied in such a manner as not to weigh upon those\nclasses. In other words, the government of the democracy is the only one\nunder which the power which lays on taxes escapes the payment of them.\n\n[Footnote e: The word poor is used here, and throughout the remainder\nof this chapter, in a relative, not in an absolute sense. Poor men in\nAmerica would often appear rich in comparison with the poor of Europe;\nbut they may with propriety by styled poor in comparison with their more\naffluent countrymen.]\n\nIt may be objected (but the argument has no real weight) that the\ntrue interest of the people is indissolubly connected with that of the\nwealthier portion of the community, since it cannot but suffer by the\nsevere measures to which it resorts. But is it not the true interest of\nkings to render their subjects happy, and the true interest of nobles\nto admit recruits into their order on suitable grounds? If remote\nadvantages had power to prevail over the passions and the exigencies\nof the moment, no such thing as a tyrannical sovereign or an exclusive\naristocracy could ever exist.\n\nAgain, it may be objected that the poor are never invested with the sole\npower of making the laws; but I reply, that wherever universal suffrage\nhas been established the majority of the community unquestionably\nexercises the legislative authority; and if it be proved that the poor\nalways constitute the majority, it may be added, with perfect truth,\nthat in the countries in which they possess the elective franchise they\npossess the sole power of making laws. But it is certain that in all the\nnations of the world the greater number has always consisted of those\npersons who hold no property, or of those whose property is insufficient\nto exempt them from the necessity of working in order to procure an easy\nsubsistence. Universal suffrage does therefore, in point of fact, invest\nthe poor with the government of society.\n\nThe disastrous influence which popular authority may sometimes exercise\nupon the finances of a State was very clearly seen in some of the\ndemocratic republics of antiquity, in which the public treasure was\nexhausted in order to relieve indigent citizens, or to supply the\ngames and theatrical amusements of the populace. It is true that the\nrepresentative system was then very imperfectly known, and that, at\nthe present time, the influence of popular passion is less felt in the\nconduct of public affairs; but it may be believed that the delegate\nwill in the end conform to the principles of his constituents, and favor\ntheir propensities as much as their interests.\n\nThe extravagance of democracy is, however, less to be dreaded in\nproportion as the people acquires a share of property, because on the\none hand the contributions of the rich are then less needed, and, on\nthe other, it is more difficult to lay on taxes which do not affect the\ninterests of the lower classes. On this account universal suffrage\nwould be less dangerous in France than in England, because in the latter\ncountry the property on which taxes may be levied is vested in fewer\nhands. America, where the great majority of the citizens possess some\nfortune, is in a still more favorable position than France.\n\nThere are still further causes which may increase the sum of public\nexpenditure in democratic countries. When the aristocracy governs, the\nindividuals who conduct the affairs of State are exempted by their own\nstation in society from every kind of privation; they are contented with\ntheir position; power and renown are the objects for which they strive;\nand, as they are placed far above the obscurer throng of citizens, they\ndo not always distinctly perceive how the well-being of the mass of the\npeople ought to redound to their own honor. They are not indeed callous\nto the sufferings of the poor, but they cannot feel those miseries as\nacutely as if they were themselves partakers of them. Provided that the\npeople appear to submit to its lot, the rulers are satisfied, and they\ndemand nothing further from the Government. An aristocracy is more\nintent upon the means of maintaining its influence than upon the means\nof improving its condition.\n\nWhen, on the contrary, the people is invested with the supreme\nauthority, the perpetual sense of their own miseries impels the rulers\nof society to seek for perpetual ameliorations. A thousand different\nobjects are subjected to improvement; the most trivial details are\nsought out as susceptible of amendment; and those changes which are\naccompanied with considerable expense are more especially advocated,\nsince the object is to render the condition of the poor more tolerable,\nwho cannot pay for themselves.\n\nMoreover, all democratic communities are agitated by an ill-defined\nexcitement and by a kind of feverish impatience, that engender a\nmultitude of innovations, almost all of which are attended with expense.\n\nIn monarchies and aristocracies the natural taste which the rulers have\nfor power and for renown is stimulated by the promptings of ambition,\nand they are frequently incited by these temptations to very costly\nundertakings. In democracies, where the rulers labor under privations,\nthey can only be courted by such means as improve their well-being, and\nthese improvements cannot take place without a sacrifice of money. When\na people begins to reflect upon its situation, it discovers a multitude\nof wants to which it had not before been subject, and to satisfy these\nexigencies recourse must be had to the coffers of the State. Hence it\narises that the public charges increase in proportion as civilization\nspreads, and that imposts are augmented as knowledge pervades the\ncommunity.\n\nThe last cause which frequently renders a democratic government\ndearer than any other is, that a democracy does not always succeed in\nmoderating its expenditure, because it does not understand the art of\nbeing economical. As the designs which it entertains are frequently\nchanged, and the agents of those designs are still more frequently\nremoved, its undertakings are often ill conducted or left unfinished: in\nthe former case the State spends sums out of all proportion to the end\nwhich it proposes to accomplish; in the second, the expense itself is\nunprofitable. *f\n\n[Footnote f: The gross receipts of the Treasury of the United States in\n1832 were about $28,000,000; in 1870 they had risen to $411,000,000. The\ngross expenditure in 1832 was $30,000,000; in 1870, $309,000,000.]\n\nTendencies Of The American Democracy As Regards The Salaries Of Public\nOfficers\n\nIn the democracies those who establish high salaries have no chance of\nprofiting by them--Tendency of the American democracy to increase\nthe salaries of subordinate officers and to lower those of the more\nimportant functionaries--Reason of this--Comparative statement of the\nsalaries of public officers in the United States and in France.\n\nThere is a powerful reason which usually induces democracies to\neconomize upon the salaries of public officers. As the number of\ncitizens who dispense the remuneration is extremely large in democratic\ncountries, so the number of persons who can hope to be benefited by the\nreceipt of it is comparatively small. In aristocratic countries, on the\ncontrary, the individuals who fix high salaries have almost always a\nvague hope of profiting by them. These appointments may be looked upon\nas a capital which they create for their own use, or at least as a\nresource for their children.\n\nIt must, however, be allowed that a democratic State is most\nparsimonious towards its principal agents. In America the secondary\nofficers are much better paid, and the dignitaries of the administration\nmuch worse, than they are elsewhere.\n\nThese opposite effects result from the same cause; the people fixes\nthe salaries of the public officers in both cases; and the scale of\nremuneration is determined by the consideration of its own wants. It is\nheld to be fair that the servants of the public should be placed in the\nsame easy circumstances as the public itself; *g but when the question\nturns upon the salaries of the great officers of State, this rule\nfails, and chance alone can guide the popular decision. The poor have no\nadequate conception of the wants which the higher classes of society may\nfeel. The sum which is scanty to the rich appears enormous to the poor\nman whose wants do not extend beyond the necessaries of life; and in his\nestimation the Governor of a State, with his twelve or fifteen hundred\ndollars a year, is a very fortunate and enviable being. *h If you\nundertake to convince him that the representative of a great people\nought to be able to maintain some show of splendor in the eyes of\nforeign nations, he will perhaps assent to your meaning; but when he\nreflects on his own humble dwelling, and on the hard-earned produce\nof his wearisome toil, he remembers all that he could do with a salary\nwhich you say is insufficient, and he is startled or almost frightened\nat the sight of such uncommon wealth. Besides, the secondary public\nofficer is almost on a level with the people, whilst the others are\nraised above it. The former may therefore excite his interest, but the\nlatter begins to arouse his envy.\n\n[Footnote g: The easy circumstances in which secondary functionaries\nare placed in the United States result also from another cause, which\nis independent of the general tendencies of democracy; every kind of\nprivate business is very lucrative, and the State would not be served at\nall if it did not pay its servants. The country is in the position of\na commercial undertaking, which is obliged to sustain an expensive\ncompetition, notwithstanding its tastes for economy.]\n\n[Footnote h: The State of Ohio, which contains a million of inhabitants,\ngives its Governor a salary of only $1,200 a year.]\n\nThis is very clearly seen in the United States, where the salaries seem\nto decrease as the authority of those who receive them augments *i\n\n[Footnote i: To render this assertion perfectly evident, it will\nsuffice to examine the scale of salaries of the agents of the Federal\nGovernment. I have added the salaries attached to the corresponding\nofficers in France under the constitutional monarchy to complete the\ncomparison.\n\n     United States\n     Treasury Department\n     Messenger ............................   $700\n     Clerk with lowest salary .............  1,000\n     Clerk with highest salary ............  1,600\n     Chief Clerk ..........................  2,000\n     Secretary of State ...................  6,000\n     The President ........................ 25,000\n\n     France\n     Ministere des Finances\n     Hussier ........................... 1,500 fr.\n     Clerk with lowest salary,  1,000 to 1,800 fr.\n     Clerk with highest salary  3,200 to 8,600 fr.\n     Secretaire-general ................20,000 fr.\n     The Minister ......................80,000 fr.\n     The King ......................12,000,000 fr.\n\nI have perhaps done wrong in selecting France as my standard of\ncomparison. In France the democratic tendencies of the nation exercise\nan ever-increasing influence upon the Government, and the Chambers show\na disposition to raise the low salaries and to lower the principal\nones. Thus, the Minister of Finance, who received 160,000 fr. under the\nEmpire, receives 80,000 fr. in 1835: the Directeurs-generaux of\nFinance, who then received 50,000 fr. now receive only 20,000 fr. [This\ncomparison is based on the state of things existing in France and\nthe United States in 1831. It has since materially altered in both\ncountries, but not so much as to impugn the truth of the author's\nobservation.]]\n\nUnder the rule of an aristocracy it frequently happens, on the contrary,\nthat whilst the high officers are receiving munificent salaries, the\ninferior ones have not more than enough to procure the necessaries of\nlife. The reason of this fact is easily discoverable from causes very\nanalogous to those to which I have just alluded. If a democracy is\nunable to conceive the pleasures of the rich or to witness them without\nenvy, an aristocracy is slow to understand, or, to speak more correctly,\nis unacquainted with, the privations of the poor. The poor man is not\n(if we use the term aright) the fellow of the rich one; but he is a\nbeing of another species. An aristocracy is therefore apt to care but\nlittle for the fate of its subordinate agents; and their salaries are\nonly raised when they refuse to perform their service for too scanty a\nremuneration.\n\nIt is the parsimonious conduct of democracy towards its principal\nofficers which has countenanced a supposition of far more economical\npropensities than any which it really possesses. It is true that it\nscarcely allows the means of honorable subsistence to the individuals\nwho conduct its affairs; but enormous sums are lavished to meet the\nexigencies or to facilitate the enjoyments of the people. *j The money\nraised by taxation may be better employed, but it is not saved. In\ngeneral, democracy gives largely to the community, and very sparingly to\nthose who govern it. The reverse is the case in aristocratic countries,\nwhere the money of the State is expended to the profit of the persons\nwho are at the head of affairs.\n\n[Footnote j: See the American budgets for the cost of indigent citizens\nand gratuitous instruction. In 1831 $250,000 were spent in the State of\nNew York for the maintenance of the poor, and at least $1,000,000\nwere devoted to gratuitous instruction. (William's \"New York Annual\nRegister,\" 1832, pp. 205 and 243.) The State of New York contained only\n1,900,000 inhabitants in the year 1830, which is not more than double\nthe amount of population in the Department du Nord in France.]\n\nDifficulty of Distinguishing The Causes Which Contribute To The Economy\nOf The American Government\n\nWe are liable to frequent errors in the research of those facts which\nexercise a serious influence upon the fate of mankind, since nothing\nis more difficult than to appreciate their real value. One people\nis naturally inconsistent and enthusiastic; another is sober and\ncalculating; and these characteristics originate in their physical\nconstitution or in remote causes with which we are unacquainted.\n\nThese are nations which are fond of parade and the bustle of festivity,\nand which do not regret the costly gaieties of an hour. Others, on\nthe contrary, are attached to more retiring pleasures, and seem almost\nashamed of appearing to be pleased. In some countries the highest value\nis set upon the beauty of public edifices; in others the productions of\nart are treated with indifference, and everything which is unproductive\nis looked down upon with contempt. In some renown, in others money, is\nthe ruling passion.\n\nIndependently of the laws, all these causes concur to exercise a very\npowerful influence upon the conduct of the finances of the State. If the\nAmericans never spend the money of the people in galas, it is not only\nbecause the imposition of taxes is under the control of the people,\nbut because the people takes no delight in public rejoicings. If they\nrepudiate all ornament from their architecture, and set no store on any\nbut the more practical and homely advantages, it is not only because\nthey live under democratic institutions, but because they are a\ncommercial nation. The habits of private life are continued in public;\nand we ought carefully to distinguish that economy which depends upon\ntheir institutions from that which is the natural result of their\nmanners and customs.\n\nWhether The Expenditure Of The United States Can Be Compared To That Of\nFrance\n\nTwo points to be established in order to estimate the extent of the\npublic charges, viz., the national wealth and the rate of taxation--The\nwealth and the charges of France not accurately known--Why the wealth\nand charges of the Union cannot be accurately known--Researches of\nthe author with a view to discover the amount of taxation of\nPennsylvania--General symptoms which may serve to indicate the amount of\nthe public charges in a given nation--Result of this investigation for\nthe Union.\n\nMany attempts have recently been made in France to compare the public\nexpenditure of that country with the expenditure of the United States;\nall these attempts have, however, been unattended by success, and a few\nwords will suffice to show that they could not have had a satisfactory\nresult.\n\n\nIn order to estimate the amount of the public charges of a people two\npreliminaries are indispensable: it is necessary, in the first place, to\nknow the wealth of that people; and in the second, to learn what portion\nof that wealth is devoted to the expenditure of the State. To show the\namount of taxation without showing the resources which are destined\nto meet the demand, is to undertake a futile labor; for it is not the\nexpenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the revenue, which\nit is desirable to know.\n\nThe same rate of taxation which may easily be supported by a wealthy\ncontributor will reduce a poor one to extreme misery. The wealth of\nnations is composed of several distinct elements, of which population\nis the first, real property the second, and personal property the third.\nThe first of these three elements may be discovered without difficulty.\nAmongst civilized nations it is easy to obtain an accurate census of\nthe inhabitants; but the two others cannot be determined with so much\nfacility. It is difficult to take an exact account of all the lands in\na country which are under cultivation, with their natural or their\nacquired value; and it is still more impossible to estimate the entire\npersonal property which is at the disposal of a nation, and which eludes\nthe strictest analysis by the diversity and the number of shapes under\nwhich it may occur. And, indeed, we find that the most ancient civilized\nnations of Europe, including even those in which the administration\nis most central, have not succeeded, as yet, in determining the exact\ncondition of their wealth.\n\nIn America the attempt has never been made; for how would such an\ninvestigation be possible in a country where society has not yet\nsettled into habits of regularity and tranquillity; where the national\nGovernment is not assisted by a multiple of agents whose exertions it\ncan command and direct to one sole end; and where statistics are not\nstudied, because no one is able to collect the necessary documents,\nor to find time to peruse them? Thus the primary elements of the\ncalculations which have been made in France cannot be obtained in the\nUnion; the relative wealth of the two countries is unknown; the property\nof the former is not accurately determined, and no means exist of\ncomputing that of the latter.\n\nI consent, therefore, for the sake of the discussion, to abandon this\nnecessary term of the comparison, and I confine myself to a computation\nof the actual amount of taxation, without investigating the relation\nwhich subsists between the taxation and the revenue. But the reader will\nperceive that my task has not been facilitated by the limits which I\nhere lay down for my researches.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that the central administration of France, assisted\nby all the public officers who are at its disposal, might determine with\nexactitude the amount of the direct and indirect taxes levied upon\nthe citizens. But this investigation, which no private individual can\nundertake, has not hitherto been completed by the French Government, or,\nat least, its results have not been made public. We are acquainted with\nthe sum total of the charges of the State; we know the amount of the\ndepartmental expenditure; but the expenses of the communal divisions\nhave not been computed, and the amount of the public expenses of France\nis consequently unknown.\n\nIf we now turn to America, we shall perceive that the difficulties are\nmultiplied and enhanced. The Union publishes an exact return of the\namount of its expenditure; the budgets of the four and twenty States\nfurnish similar returns of their revenues; but the expenses incident to\nthe affairs of the counties and the townships are unknown. *k\n\n[Footnote k: The Americans, as we have seen, have four separate budgets,\nthe Union, the States, the Counties, and the Townships having each\nseverally their own. During my stay in America I made every endeavor\nto discover the amount of the public expenditure in the townships and\ncounties of the principal States of the Union, and I readily obtained\nthe budget of the larger townships, but I found it quite impossible to\nprocure that of the smaller ones. I possess, however, some documents\nrelating to county expenses, which, although incomplete, are still\ncurious. I have to thank Mr. Richards, Mayor of Philadelphia, for the\nbudgets of thirteen of the counties of Pennsylvania, viz., Lebanon,\nCentre, Franklin, Fayette, Montgomery, Luzerne, Dauphin, Butler,\nAlleghany, Columbia, Northampton, Northumberland, and Philadelphia,\nfor the year 1830. Their population at that time consisted of 495,207\ninhabitants. On looking at the map of Pennsylvania, it will be seen\nthat these thirteen counties are scattered in every direction, and so\ngenerally affected by the causes which usually influence the condition\nof a country, that they may easily be supposed to furnish a correct\naverage of the financial state of the counties of Pennsylvania in\ngeneral; and thus, upon reckoning that the expenses of these counties\namounted in the year 1830 to about $361,650, or nearly 75 cents for each\ninhabitant, and calculating that each of them contributed in the same\nyear about $2.55 towards the Union, and about 75 cents to the State of\nPennsylvania, it appears that they each contributed as their share\nof all the public expenses (except those of the townships) the sum of\n$4.05. This calculation is doubly incomplete, as it applies only to a\nsingle year and to one part of the public charges; but it has at least\nthe merit of not being conjectural.]\n\nThe authority of the Federal government cannot oblige the provincial\ngovernments to throw any light upon this point; and even if these\ngovernments were inclined to afford their simultaneous co-operation,\nit may be doubted whether they possess the means of procuring a\nsatisfactory answer. Independently of the natural difficulties of the\ntask, the political organization of the country would act as a hindrance\nto the success of their efforts. The county and town magistrates are not\nappointed by the authorities of the State, and they are not subjected\nto their control. It is therefore very allowable to suppose that, if the\nState was desirous of obtaining the returns which we require, its design\nwould be counteracted by the neglect of those subordinate officers whom\nit would be obliged to employ. *l It is, in point of fact, useless to\ninquire what the Americans might do to forward this inquiry, since it\nis certain that they have hitherto done nothing at all. There does not\nexist a single individual at the present day, in America or in Europe,\nwho can inform us what each citizen of the Union annually contributes\nto the public charges of the nation. *m [Footnote l: Those who have\nattempted to draw a comparison between the expenses of France and\nAmerica have at once perceived that no such comparison could be drawn\nbetween the total expenditure of the two countries; but they have\nendeavored to contrast detached portions of this expenditure. It may\nreadily be shown that this second system is not at all less defective\nthan the first. If I attempt to compare the French budget with the\nbudget of the Union, it must be remembered that the latter embraces much\nfewer objects than then central Government of the former country, and\nthat the expenditure must consequently be much smaller. If I contrast\nthe budgets of the Departments with those of the States which constitute\nthe Union, it must be observed that, as the power and control exercised\nby the States is much greater than that which is exercised by the\nDepartments, their expenditure is also more considerable. As for the\nbudgets of the counties, nothing of the kind occurs in the French\nsystem of finances; and it is, again, doubtful whether the corresponding\nexpenses should be referred to the budget of the State or to those of\nthe municipal divisions. Municipal expenses exist in both countries,\nbut they are not always analogous. In America the townships discharge a\nvariety of offices which are reserved in France to the Departments or\nto the State. It may, moreover, be asked what is to be understood by the\nmunicipal expenses of America. The organization of the municipal bodies\nor townships differs in the several States. Are we to be guided by what\noccurs in New England or in Georgia, in Pennsylvania or in the State\nof Illinois? A kind of analogy may very readily be perceived between\ncertain budgets in the two countries; but as the elements of which\nthey are composed always differ more or less, no fair comparison can\nbe instituted between them. [The same difficulty exists, perhaps to a\ngreater degree at the present time, when the taxation of America has\nlargely increased.--1874.]]\n\n[Footnote m: Even if we knew the exact pecuniary contributions of every\nFrench and American citizen to the coffers of the State, we should only\ncome at a portion of the truth. Governments do not only demand supplies\nof money, but they call for personal services, which may be looked upon\nas equivalent to a given sum. When a State raises an army, besides the\npay of the troops, which is furnished by the entire nation, each soldier\nmust give up his time, the value of which depends on the use he might\nmake of it if he were not in the service. The same remark applies to the\nmilitia; the citizen who is in the militia devotes a certain portion\nof valuable time to the maintenance of the public peace, and he does in\nreality surrender to the State those earnings which he is prevented from\ngaining. Many other instances might be cited in addition to these. The\ngovernments of France and of America both levy taxes of this kind,\nwhich weigh upon the citizens; but who can estimate with accuracy their\nrelative amount in the two countries?\n\nThis, however, is not the last of the difficulties which prevent us from\ncomparing the expenditure of the Union with that of France. The French\nGovernment contracts certain obligations which do not exist in America,\nand vice versa. The French Government pays the clergy; in America the\nvoluntary principle prevails. In America there is a legal provision for\nthe poor; in France they are abandoned to the charity of the public. The\nFrench public officers are paid by a fixed salary; in America they are\nallowed certain perquisites. In France contributions in kind take place\non very few roads; in America upon almost all the thoroughfares: in\nthe former country the roads are free to all travellers; in the\nlatter turnpikes abound. All these differences in the manner in which\ncontributions are levied in the two countries enhance the difficulty of\ncomparing their expenditure; for there are certain expenses which the\ncitizens would not be subject to, or which would at any rate be much\nless considerable, if the State did not take upon itself to act in the\nname of the public.]\n\nHence we must conclude that it is no less difficult to compare the\nsocial expenditure than it is to estimate the relative wealth of France\nand America. I will even add that it would be dangerous to attempt this\ncomparison; for when statistics are not based upon computations which\nare strictly accurate, they mislead instead of guiding aright. The mind\nis easily imposed upon by the false affectation of exactness, which\nprevails even in the misstatements of science, and it adopts with\nconfidence errors which are dressed in the forms of mathematical truth.\n\nWe abandon, therefore, our numerical investigation, with the hope of\nmeeting with data of another kind. In the absence of positive documents,\nwe may form an opinion as to the proportion which the taxation of a\npeople bears to its real prosperity, by observing whether its external\nappearance is flourishing; whether, after having discharged the calls of\nthe State, the poor man retains the means of subsistence, and the rich\nthe means of enjoyment; and whether both classes are contented with\ntheir position, seeking, however, to ameliorate it by perpetual\nexertions, so that industry is never in want of capital, nor capital\nunemployed by industry. The observer who draws his inferences from these\nsigns will, undoubtedly, be led to the conclusion that the American of\nthe United States contributes a much smaller portion of his income to\nthe State than the citizen of France. Nor, indeed, can the result be\notherwise.\n\nA portion of the French debt is the consequence of two successive\ninvasions; and the Union has no similar calamity to fear. A nation\nplaced upon the continent of Europe is obliged to maintain a large\nstanding army; the isolated position of the Union enables it to have\nonly 6,000 soldiers. The French have a fleet of 300 sail; the Americans\nhave 52 vessels. *n How, then, can the inhabitants of the Union be\ncalled upon to contribute as largely as the inhabitants of France?\nNo parallel can be drawn between the finances of two countries so\ndifferently situated.\n\n[Footnote n: See the details in the Budget of the French Minister of\nMarine; and for America, the National Calendar of 1833, p. 228. [But\nthe public debt of the United States in 1870, caused by the Civil War,\namounted to $2,480,672,427; that of France was more than doubled by the\nextravagance of the Second Empire and by the war of 1870.]]\n\nIt is by examining what actually takes place in the Union, and not\nby comparing the Union with France, that we may discover whether the\nAmerican Government is really economical. On casting my eyes over the\ndifferent republics which form the confederation, I perceive that their\nGovernments lack perseverance in their undertakings, and that they\nexercise no steady control over the men whom they employ. Whence I\nnaturally infer that they must often spend the money of the people to\nno purpose, or consume more of it than is really necessary to their\nundertakings. Great efforts are made, in accordance with the democratic\norigin of society, to satisfy the exigencies of the lower orders, to\nopen the career of power to their endeavors, and to diffuse knowledge\nand comfort amongst them. The poor are maintained, immense sums are\nannually devoted to public instruction, all services whatsoever are\nremunerated, and the most subordinate agents are liberally paid. If\nthis kind of government appears to me to be useful and rational, I am\nnevertheless constrained to admit that it is expensive.\n\nWherever the poor direct public affairs and dispose of the national\nresources, it appears certain that, as they profit by the expenditure of\nthe State, they are apt to augment that expenditure.\n\nI conclude, therefore, without having recourse to inaccurate\ncomputations, and without hazarding a comparison which might prove\nincorrect, that the democratic government of the Americans is not a\ncheap government, as is sometimes asserted; and I have no hesitation in\npredicting that, if the people of the United States is ever involved\nin serious difficulties, its taxation will speedily be increased to the\nrate of that which prevails in the greater part of the aristocracies and\nthe monarchies of Europe. *o\n\n[Footnote o: [That is precisely what has since occurred.]]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIII: Government Of The Democracy In America--Part III\n\nCorruption And Vices Of The Rulers In A Democracy, And Consequent\nEffects Upon Public Morality\n\nIn aristocracies rulers sometimes endeavor to corrupt the people--In\ndemocracies rulers frequently show themselves to be corrupt--In the\nformer their vices are directly prejudicial to the morality of the\npeople--In the latter their indirect influence is still more pernicious.\n\nA distinction must be made, when the aristocratic and the democratic\nprinciples mutually inveigh against each other, as tending to facilitate\ncorruption. In aristocratic governments the individuals who are placed\nat the head of affairs are rich men, who are solely desirous of power.\nIn democracies statesmen are poor, and they have their fortunes to make.\nThe consequence is that in aristocratic States the rulers are rarely\naccessible to corruption, and have very little craving for money; whilst\nthe reverse is the case in democratic nations.\n\nBut in aristocracies, as those who are desirous of arriving at the head\nof affairs are possessed of considerable wealth, and as the number of\npersons by whose assistance they may rise is comparatively small, the\ngovernment is, if I may use the expression, put up to a sort of auction.\nIn democracies, on the contrary, those who are covetous of power are\nvery seldom wealthy, and the number of citizens who confer that power is\nextremely great. Perhaps in democracies the number of men who might be\nbought is by no means smaller, but buyers are rarely to be met with;\nand, besides, it would be necessary to buy so many persons at once that\nthe attempt is rendered nugatory.\n\nMany of the men who have been in the administration in France during\nthe last forty years have been accused of making their fortunes at\nthe expense of the State or of its allies; a reproach which was rarely\naddressed to the public characters of the ancient monarchy. But in\nFrance the practice of bribing electors is almost unknown, whilst it is\nnotoriously and publicly carried on in England. In the United States\nI never heard a man accused of spending his wealth in corrupting\nthe populace; but I have often heard the probity of public officers\nquestioned; still more frequently have I heard their success attributed\nto low intrigues and immoral practices.\n\nIf, then, the men who conduct the government of an aristocracy sometimes\nendeavor to corrupt the people, the heads of a democracy are themselves\ncorrupt. In the former case the morality of the people is directly\nassailed; in the latter an indirect influence is exercised upon the\npeople which is still more to be dreaded.\n\nAs the rulers of democratic nations are almost always exposed to\nthe suspicion of dishonorable conduct, they in some measure lend the\nauthority of the Government to the base practices of which they are\naccused. They thus afford an example which must prove discouraging\nto the struggles of virtuous independence, and must foster the secret\ncalculations of a vicious ambition. If it be asserted that evil passions\nare displayed in all ranks of society, that they ascend the throne by\nhereditary right, and that despicable characters are to be met with\nat the head of aristocratic nations as well as in the sphere of a\ndemocracy, this objection has but little weight in my estimation. The\ncorruption of men who have casually risen to power has a coarse and\nvulgar infection in it which renders it contagious to the multitude. On\nthe contrary, there is a kind of aristocratic refinement and an air of\ngrandeur in the depravity of the great, which frequently prevent it from\nspreading abroad.\n\nThe people can never penetrate into the perplexing labyrinth of court\nintrigue, and it will always have difficulty in detecting the turpitude\nwhich lurks under elegant manners, refined tastes, and graceful\nlanguage. But to pillage the public purse, and to vend the favors of the\nState, are arts which the meanest villain may comprehend, and hope to\npractice in his turn.\n\nIn reality it is far less prejudicial to witness the immorality of the\ngreat than to witness that immorality which leads to greatness. In a\ndemocracy private citizens see a man of their own rank in life, who\nrises from that obscure position, and who becomes possessed of riches\nand of power in a few years; the spectacle excites their surprise and\ntheir envy, and they are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday\ntheir equal is to-day their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents\nor his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they\nare themselves less virtuous and less talented than he was. They are\ntherefore led (and not unfrequently their conjecture is a correct one)\nto impute his success mainly to some one of his defects; and an odious\nmixture is thus formed of the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness\nand success, utility and dishonor.\n\nEfforts Of Which A Democracy Is Capable\n\nThe Union has only had one struggle hitherto for its\nexistence--Enthusiasm at the commencement of the war--Indifference\ntowards its close--Difficulty of establishing military conscription\nor impressment of seamen in America--Why a democratic people is less\ncapable of sustained effort than another.\n\nI here warn the reader that I speak of a government which implicitly\nfollows the real desires of a people, and not of a government which\nsimply commands in its name. Nothing is so irresistible as a tyrannical\npower commanding in the name of the people, because, whilst it exercises\nthat moral influence which belongs to the decision of the majority, it\nacts at the same time with the promptitude and the tenacity of a single\nman.\n\nIt is difficult to say what degree of exertion a democratic government\nmay be capable of making a crisis in the history of the nation. But no\ngreat democratic republic has hitherto existed in the world. To style\nthe oligarchy which ruled over France in 1793 by that name would be to\noffer an insult to the republican form of government. The United States\nafford the first example of the kind.\n\nThe American Union has now subsisted for half a century, in the course\nof which time its existence has only once been attacked, namely, during\nthe War of Independence. At the commencement of that long war, various\noccurrences took place which betokened an extraordinary zeal for the\nservice of the country. *p But as the contest was prolonged, symptoms of\nprivate egotism began to show themselves. No money was poured into the\npublic treasury; few recruits could be raised to join the army; the\npeople wished to acquire independence, but was very ill-disposed to\nundergo the privations by which alone it could be obtained. \"Tax\nlaws,\" says Hamilton in the \"Federalist\" (No. 12), \"have in vain been\nmultiplied; new methods to enforce the collection have in vain been\ntried; the public expectation has been uniformly disappointed and the\ntreasuries of the States have remained empty. The popular system of\nadministration inherent in the nature of popular government, coinciding\nwith the real scarcity of money incident to a languid and mutilated\nstate of trade, has hitherto defeated every experiment for extensive\ncollections, and has at length taught the different legislatures the\nfolly of attempting them.\"\n\n[Footnote p: One of the most singular of these occurrences was the\nresolution which the Americans took of temporarily abandoning the use of\ntea. Those who know that men usually cling more to their habits than\nto their life will doubtless admire this great though obscure sacrifice\nwhich was made by a whole people.]\n\nThe United States have not had any serious war to carry on ever since\nthat period. In order, therefore, to appreciate the sacrifices which\ndemocratic nations may impose upon themselves, we must wait until the\nAmerican people is obliged to put half its entire income at the disposal\nof the Government, as was done by the English; or until it sends forth a\ntwentieth part of its population to the field of battle, as was done by\nFrance. *q\n\n[Footnote q: [The Civil War showed that when the necessity arose the\nAmerican people, both in the North and in the South, are capable of\nmaking the most enormous sacrifices, both in money and in men.]]\n\nIn America the use of conscription is unknown, and men are induced to\nenlist by bounties. The notions and habits of the people of the United\nStates are so opposed to compulsory enlistment that I do not imagine it\ncan ever be sanctioned by the laws. What is termed the conscription\nin France is assuredly the heaviest tax upon the population of that\ncountry; yet how could a great continental war be carried on without it?\nThe Americans have not adopted the British impressment of seamen, and\nthey have nothing which corresponds to the French system of maritime\nconscription; the navy, as well as the merchant service, is supplied\nby voluntary service. But it is not easy to conceive how a people can\nsustain a great maritime war without having recourse to one or the other\nof these two systems. Indeed, the Union, which has fought with some\nhonor upon the seas, has never possessed a very numerous fleet, and\nthe equipment of the small number of American vessels has always been\nexcessively expensive.\n\nI have heard American statesmen confess that the Union will have great\ndifficulty in maintaining its rank on the seas without adopting the\nsystem of impressment or of maritime conscription; but the difficulty is\nto induce the people, which exercises the supreme authority, to submit\nto impressment or any compulsory system.\n\nIt is incontestable that in times of danger a free people displays far\nmore energy than one which is not so. But I incline to believe that\nthis is more especially the case in those free nations in which the\ndemocratic element preponderates. Democracy appears to me to be much\nbetter adapted for the peaceful conduct of society, or for an occasional\neffort of remarkable vigor, than for the hardy and prolonged endurance\nof the storms which beset the political existence of nations. The reason\nis very evident; it is enthusiasm which prompts men to expose themselves\nto dangers and privations, but they will not support them long without\nreflection. There is more calculation, even in the impulses of bravery,\nthan is generally attributed to them; and although the first efforts are\nsuggested by passion, perseverance is maintained by a distinct regard of\nthe purpose in view. A portion of what we value is exposed, in order to\nsave the remainder.\n\nBut it is this distinct perception of the future, founded upon a sound\njudgment and an enlightened experience, which is most frequently wanting\nin democracies. The populace is more apt to feel than to reason; and\nif its present sufferings are great, it is to be feared that the still\ngreater sufferings attendant upon defeat will be forgotten.\n\nAnother cause tends to render the efforts of a democratic government\nless persevering than those of an aristocracy. Not only are the lower\nclasses less awakened than the higher orders to the good or evil chances\nof the future, but they are liable to suffer far more acutely from\npresent privations. The noble exposes his life, indeed, but the chance\nof glory is equal to the chance of harm. If he sacrifices a large\nportion of his income to the State, he deprives himself for a time of\nthe pleasures of affluence; but to the poor man death is embellished\nby no pomp or renown, and the imposts which are irksome to the rich are\nfatal to him.\n\nThis relative impotence of democratic republics is, perhaps, the\ngreatest obstacle to the foundation of a republic of this kind in\nEurope. In order that such a State should subsist in one country of the\nOld World, it would be necessary that similar institutions should be\nintroduced into all the other nations.\n\nI am of opinion that a democratic government tends in the end to\nincrease the real strength of society; but it can never combine, upon a\nsingle point and at a given time, so much power as an aristocracy or\na monarchy. If a democratic country remained during a whole century\nsubject to a republican government, it would probably at the end of\nthat period be more populous and more prosperous than the neighboring\ndespotic States. But it would have incurred the risk of being conquered\nmuch oftener than they would in that lapse of years.\n\nSelf-Control Of The American Democracy\n\nThe American people acquiesces slowly, or frequently does not acquiesce,\nin what is beneficial to its interests--The faults of the American\ndemocracy are for the most part reparable.\n\nThe difficulty which a democracy has in conquering the passions and in\nsubduing the exigencies of the moment, with a view to the future, is\nconspicuous in the most trivial occurrences of the United States. The\npeople, which is surrounded by flatterers, has great difficulty in\nsurmounting its inclinations, and whenever it is solicited to undergo a\nprivation or any kind of inconvenience, even to attain an end which is\nsanctioned by its own rational conviction, it almost always refuses to\ncomply at first. The deference of the Americans to the laws has\nbeen very justly applauded; but it must be added that in America the\nlegislation is made by the people and for the people. Consequently, in\nthe United States the law favors those classes which are most interested\nin evading it elsewhere. It may therefore be supposed that an offensive\nlaw, which should not be acknowledged to be one of immediate utility,\nwould either not be enacted or would not be obeyed.\n\nIn America there is no law against fraudulent bankruptcies; not because\nthey are few, but because there are a great number of bankruptcies. The\ndread of being prosecuted as a bankrupt acts with more intensity upon\nthe mind of the majority of the people than the fear of being involved\nin losses or ruin by the failure of other parties, and a sort of guilty\ntolerance is extended by the public conscience to an offence which\neveryone condemns in his individual capacity. In the new States of the\nSouthwest the citizens generally take justice into their own hands,\nand murders are of very frequent occurrence. This arises from the rude\nmanners and the ignorance of the inhabitants of those deserts, who do\nnot perceive the utility of investing the law with adequate force, and\nwho prefer duels to prosecutions.\n\nSomeone observed to me one day, in Philadelphia, that almost all crimes\nin America are caused by the abuse of intoxicating liquors, which the\nlower classes can procure in great abundance, from their excessive\ncheapness. \"How comes it,\" said I, \"that you do not put a duty upon\nbrandy?\" \"Our legislators,\" rejoined my informant, \"have frequently\nthought of this expedient; but the task of putting it in operation is a\ndifficult one; a revolt might be apprehended, and the members who\nshould vote for a law of this kind would be sure of losing their\nseats.\" \"Whence I am to infer,\" replied I, \"that the drinking population\nconstitutes the majority in your country, and that temperance is\nsomewhat unpopular.\"\n\nWhen these things are pointed out to the American statesmen, they\ncontent themselves with assuring you that time will operate the\nnecessary change, and that the experience of evil will teach the people\nits true interests. This is frequently true, although a democracy is\nmore liable to error than a monarch or a body of nobles; the chances of\nits regaining the right path when once it has acknowledged its\nmistake, are greater also; because it is rarely embarrassed by internal\ninterests, which conflict with those of the majority, and resist the\nauthority of reason. But a democracy can only obtain truth as the result\nof experience, and many nations may forfeit their existence whilst they\nare awaiting the consequences of their errors.\n\nThe great privilege of the Americans does not simply consist in their\nbeing more enlightened than other nations, but in their being able to\nrepair the faults they may commit. To which it must be added, that a\ndemocracy cannot derive substantial benefit from past experience, unless\nit be arrived at a certain pitch of knowledge and civilization. There\nare tribes and peoples whose education has been so vicious, and whose\ncharacter presents so strange a mixture of passion, of ignorance, and of\nerroneous notions upon all subjects, that they are unable to discern the\ncauses of their own wretchedness, and they fall a sacrifice to ills with\nwhich they are unacquainted.\n\nI have crossed vast tracts of country that were formerly inhabited by\npowerful Indian nations which are now extinct; I have myself passed some\ntime in the midst of mutilated tribes, which witness the daily decline\nof their numerical strength and of the glory of their independence; and\nI have heard these Indians themselves anticipate the impending doom of\ntheir race. Every European can perceive means which would rescue\nthese unfortunate beings from inevitable destruction. They alone are\ninsensible to the expedient; they feel the woe which year after year\nheaps upon their heads, but they will perish to a man without accepting\nthe remedy. It would be necessary to employ force to induce them to\nsubmit to the protection and the constraint of civilization.\n\nThe incessant revolutions which have convulsed the South American\nprovinces for the last quarter of a century have frequently been\nadverted to with astonishment, and expectations have been expressed that\nthose nations would speedily return to their natural state. But can\nit be affirmed that the turmoil of revolution is not actually the most\nnatural state of the South American Spaniards at the present time? In\nthat country society is plunged into difficulties from which all its\nefforts are insufficient to rescue it. The inhabitants of that fair\nportion of the Western Hemisphere seem obstinately bent on pursuing\nthe work of inward havoc. If they fall into a momentary repose from the\neffects of exhaustion, that repose prepares them for a fresh state of\nfrenzy. When I consider their condition, which alternates between misery\nand crime, I should be inclined to believe that despotism itself would\nbe a benefit to them, if it were possible that the words despotism and\nbenefit could ever be united in my mind.\n\nConduct Of Foreign Affairs By The American Democracy\n\nDirection given to the foreign policy of the United States by\nWashington and Jefferson--Almost all the defects inherent in\ndemocratic institutions are brought to light in the conduct of foreign\naffairs--Their advantages are less perceptible.\n\nWe have seen that the Federal Constitution entrusts the permanent\ndirection of the external interests of the nation to the President and\nthe Senate, *r which tends in some degree to detach the general foreign\npolicy of the Union from the control of the people. It cannot therefore\nbe asserted with truth that the external affairs of State are conducted\nby the democracy.\n\n[Footnote r: \"The President,\" says the Constitution, Art. II, sect. 2,\nSection 2, \"shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the\nSenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present\nconcur.\" The reader is reminded that the senators are returned for a\nterm of six years, and that they are chosen by the legislature of each\nState.]\n\nThe policy of America owes its rise to Washington, and after him to\nJefferson, who established those principles which it observes at the\npresent day. Washington said in the admirable letter which he addressed\nto his fellow-citizens, and which may be looked upon as his political\nbequest to the country: \"The great rule of conduct for us in regard to\nforeign nations is, in extending our commercial relations, to have\nwith them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have\nalready formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good\nfaith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to\nus have none, or a very remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in\nfrequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to\nour concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate\nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her\npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships\nor enmities. Our detached and distant situation invites and enables\nus to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an\nefficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy\nmaterial injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an\nattitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon\nto be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the\nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard\nthe giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our\ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel. Why forego the advantages of\nso peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?\nWhy, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe,\nentangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition,\nrivalship, interest, humor, or caprice? It is our true policy to steer\nclear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world;\nso far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be\nunderstood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements.\nI hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs,\nthat honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it; therefore, let\nthose engagements be observed in their genuine sense; but in my opinion\nit is unnecessary, and would be unwise, to extend them. Taking care\nalways to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, in a respectable\ndefensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for\nextraordinary emergencies.\" In a previous part of the same letter\nWashington makes the following admirable and just remark: \"The nation\nwhich indulges towards another an habitual hatred or an habitual\nfondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to\nits affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its\nduty and its interest.\"\n\nThe political conduct of Washington was always guided by these maxims.\nHe succeeded in maintaining his country in a state of peace whilst all\nthe other nations of the globe were at war; and he laid it down as a\nfundamental doctrine, that the true interest of the Americans consisted\nin a perfect neutrality with regard to the internal dissensions of the\nEuropean Powers.\n\nJefferson went still further, and he introduced a maxim into the policy\nof the Union, which affirms that \"the Americans ought never to solicit\nany privileges from foreign nations, in order not to be obliged to grant\nsimilar privileges themselves.\"\n\nThese two principles, which were so plain and so just as to be adapted\nto the capacity of the populace, have greatly simplified the foreign\npolicy of the United States. As the Union takes no part in the affairs\nof Europe, it has, properly speaking, no foreign interests to discuss,\nsince it has at present no powerful neighbors on the American continent.\nThe country is as much removed from the passions of the Old World by its\nposition as by the line of policy which it has chosen, and it is neither\ncalled upon to repudiate nor to espouse the conflicting interests of\nEurope; whilst the dissensions of the New World are still concealed\nwithin the bosom of the future.\n\nThe Union is free from all pre-existing obligations, and it is\nconsequently enabled to profit by the experience of the old nations\nof Europe, without being obliged, as they are, to make the best of the\npast, and to adapt it to their present circumstances; or to accept\nthat immense inheritance which they derive from their forefathers--an\ninheritance of glory mingled with calamities, and of alliances\nconflicting with national antipathies. The foreign policy of the United\nStates is reduced by its very nature to await the chances of the\nfuture history of the nation, and for the present it consists more in\nabstaining from interference than in exerting its activity.\n\nIt is therefore very difficult to ascertain, at present, what degree\nof sagacity the American democracy will display in the conduct of the\nforeign policy of the country; and upon this point its adversaries, as\nwell as its advocates, must suspend their judgment. As for myself I have\nno hesitation in avowing my conviction, that it is most especially in\nthe conduct of foreign relations that democratic governments appear to\nme to be decidedly inferior to governments carried on upon different\nprinciples. Experience, instruction, and habit may almost always succeed\nin creating a species of practical discretion in democracies, and that\nscience of the daily occurrences of life which is called good sense.\nGood sense may suffice to direct the ordinary course of society; and\namongst a people whose education has been provided for, the advantages\nof democratic liberty in the internal affairs of the country may more\nthan compensate for the evils inherent in a democratic government. But\nsuch is not always the case in the mutual relations of foreign nations.\n\nForeign politics demand scarcely any of those qualities which a\ndemocracy possesses; and they require, on the contrary, the perfect use\nof almost all those faculties in which it is deficient. Democracy is\nfavorable to the increase of the internal resources of the State; it\ntends to diffuse a moderate independence; it promotes the growth of\npublic spirit, and fortifies the respect which is entertained for law in\nall classes of society; and these are advantages which only exercise an\nindirect influence over the relations which one people bears to another.\nBut a democracy is unable to regulate the details of an important\nundertaking, to persevere in a design, and to work out its execution in\nthe presence of serious obstacles. It cannot combine its measures with\nsecrecy, and it will not await their consequences with patience. These\nare qualities which more especially belong to an individual or to an\naristocracy; and they are precisely the means by which an individual\npeople attains to a predominant position.\n\nIf, on the contrary, we observe the natural defects of aristocracy,\nwe shall find that their influence is comparatively innoxious in the\ndirection of the external affairs of a State. The capital fault of which\naristocratic bodies may be accused is that they are more apt to contrive\ntheir own advantage than that of the mass of the people. In foreign\npolitics it is rare for the interest of the aristocracy to be in any way\ndistinct from that of the people.\n\nThe propensity which democracies have to obey the impulse of passion\nrather than the suggestions of prudence, and to abandon a mature design\nfor the gratification of a momentary caprice, was very clearly seen in\nAmerica on the breaking out of the French Revolution. It was then as\nevident to the simplest capacity as it is at the present time that the\ninterest of the Americans forbade them to take any part in the contest\nwhich was about to deluge Europe with blood, but which could by no means\ninjure the welfare of their own country. Nevertheless the sympathies of\nthe people declared themselves with so much violence in behalf of France\nthat nothing but the inflexible character of Washington, and the immense\npopularity which he enjoyed, could have prevented the Americans from\ndeclaring war against England. And even then, the exertions which\nthe austere reason of that great man made to repress the generous but\nimprudent passions of his fellow-citizens, very nearly deprived him of\nthe sole recompense which he had ever claimed--that of his country's\nlove. The majority then reprobated the line of policy which he adopted,\nand which has since been unanimously approved by the nation. *s If the\nConstitution and the favor of the public had not entrusted the direction\nof the foreign affairs of the country to Washington, it is certain that\nthe American nation would at that time have taken the very measures\nwhich it now condemns.\n\n[Footnote s: See the fifth volume of Marshall's \"Life of Washington.\" In\na government constituted like that of the United States, he says,\n\"it is impossible for the chief magistrate, however firm he may be, to\noppose for any length of time the torrent of popular opinion; and the\nprevalent opinion of that day seemed to incline to war. In fact, in\nthe session of Congress held at the time, it was frequently seen that\nWashington had lost the majority in the House of Representatives.\" The\nviolence of the language used against him in public was extreme, and in\na political meeting they did not scruple to compare him indirectly to\nthe treacherous Arnold. \"By the opposition,\" says Marshall, \"the friends\nof the administration were declared to be an aristocratic and corrupt\nfaction, who, from a desire to introduce monarchy, were hostile to\nFrance and under the influence of Britain; that they were a paper\nnobility, whose extreme sensibility at every measure which threatened\nthe funds, induced a tame submission to injuries and insults, which the\ninterests and honor of the nation required them to resist.\"]\n\nAlmost all the nations which have ever exercised a powerful influence\nupon the destinies of the world by conceiving, following up, and\nexecuting vast designs--from the Romans to the English--have been\ngoverned by aristocratic institutions. Nor will this be a subject of\nwonder when we recollect that nothing in the world has so absolute a\nfixity of purpose as an aristocracy. The mass of the people may be led\nastray by ignorance or passion; the mind of a king may be biased, and\nhis perseverance in his designs may be shaken--besides which a king is\nnot immortal--but an aristocratic body is too numerous to be led astray\nby the blandishments of intrigue, and yet not numerous enough to yield\nreadily to the intoxicating influence of unreflecting passion: it has\nthe energy of a firm and enlightened individual, added to the power\nwhich it derives from perpetuity.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV: Advantages American Society Derive From Democracy--Part I\n\nWhat The Real Advantages Are Which American Society Derives From The\nGovernment Of The Democracy\n\nBefore I enter upon the subject of the present chapter I am induced\nto remind the reader of what I have more than once adverted to in the\ncourse of this book. The political institutions of the United States\nappear to me to be one of the forms of government which a democracy may\nadopt; but I do not regard the American Constitution as the best, or as\nthe only one, which a democratic people may establish. In showing the\nadvantages which the Americans derive from the government of democracy,\nI am therefore very far from meaning, or from believing, that similar\nadvantages can only be obtained from the same laws.\n\nGeneral Tendency Of The Laws Under The Rule Of The American Democracy,\nAnd Habits Of Those Who Apply Them\n\nDefects of a democratic government easy to be discovered--Its advantages\nonly to be discerned by long observation--Democracy in America often\ninexpert, but the general tendency of the laws advantageous--In the\nAmerican democracy public officers have no permanent interests distinct\nfrom those of the majority--Result of this state of things.\n\nThe defects and the weaknesses of a democratic government may very\nreadily be discovered; they are demonstrated by the most flagrant\ninstances, whilst its beneficial influence is less perceptibly\nexercised. A single glance suffices to detect its evil consequences, but\nits good qualities can only be discerned by long observation. The laws\nof the American democracy are frequently defective or incomplete; they\nsometimes attack vested rights, or give a sanction to others which are\ndangerous to the community; but even if they were good, the frequent\nchanges which they undergo would be an evil. How comes it, then, that\nthe American republics prosper and maintain their position?\n\nIn the consideration of laws a distinction must be carefully observed\nbetween the end at which they aim and the means by which they are\ndirected to that end, between their absolute and their relative\nexcellence. If it be the intention of the legislator to favor the\ninterests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the\nmeasures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in\nview with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the law may\nbe well drawn up, although its purpose be bad; and the more efficacious\nit is, the greater is the mischief which it causes.\n\nDemocratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest\npossible number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens, who\nare subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their\nown advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to\nconcentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority, because\nan aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may\ntherefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of\na democracy in the conduct of its legislation is useful to a greater\nnumber of citizens than that of an aristocracy. This is, however, the\nsum total of its advantages.\n\nAristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation\nthan democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a self-control which\nprotects them from the errors of temporary excitement, and they form\nlasting designs which they mature with the assistance of favorable\nopportunities. Aristocratic government proceeds with the dexterity of\nart; it understands how to make the collective force of all its laws\nconverge at the same time to a given point. Such is not the case with\ndemocracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective or inopportune.\nThe means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of\naristocracy, and the measures which it unwittingly adopts are frequently\nopposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful.\n\nLet us now imagine a community so organized by nature, or by its\nconstitution, that it can support the transitory action of bad laws,\nand that it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of\nthe legislation: we shall then be able to conceive that a democratic\ngovernment, notwithstanding its defects, will be most fitted to conduce\nto the prosperity of this community. This is precisely what has occurred\nin the United States; and I repeat, what I have before remarked, that\nthe great advantage of the Americans consists in their being able to\ncommit faults which they may afterward repair.\n\nAn analogous observation may be made respecting public officers. It\nis easy to perceive that the American democracy frequently errs in\nthe choice of the individuals to whom it entrusts the power of the\nadministration; but it is more difficult to say why the State prospers\nunder their rule. In the first place it is to be remarked, that if in a\ndemocratic State the governors have less honesty and less capacity than\nelsewhere, the governed, on the other hand, are more enlightened and\nmore attentive to their interests. As the people in democracies is more\nincessantly vigilant in its affairs and more jealous of its rights,\nit prevents its representatives from abandoning that general line of\nconduct which its own interest prescribes. In the second place, it must\nbe remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse\nhis power, he possesses it for a shorter period of time. But there is\nyet another reason which is still more general and conclusive. It is\nno doubt of importance to the welfare of nations that they should be\ngoverned by men of talents and virtue; but it is perhaps still more\nimportant that the interests of those men should not differ from the\ninterests of the community at large; for, if such were the case, virtues\nof a high order might become useless, and talents might be turned to\na bad account. I say that it is important that the interests of the\npersons in authority should not conflict with or oppose the interests of\nthe community at large; but I do not insist upon their having the same\ninterests as the whole population, because I am not aware that such a\nstate of things ever existed in any country.\n\nNo political form has hitherto been discovered which is equally\nfavorable to the prosperity and the development of all the classes into\nwhich society is divided. These classes continue to form, as it were,\na certain number of distinct nations in the same nation; and experience\nhas shown that it is no less dangerous to place the fate of these\nclasses exclusively in the hands of any one of them than it is to make\none people the arbiter of the destiny of another. When the rich alone\ngovern, the interest of the poor is always endangered; and when the poor\nmake the laws, that of the rich incurs very serious risks. The advantage\nof democracy does not consist, therefore, as has sometimes been\nasserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in contributing\nto the well-being of the greatest possible number.\n\nThe men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the\nUnited States are frequently inferior, both in point of capacity and of\nmorality, to those whom aristocratic institutions would raise to\npower. But their interest is identified and confounded with that of the\nmajority of their fellow-citizens. They may frequently be faithless and\nfrequently mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of\nconduct opposed to the will of the majority; and it is impossible that\nthey should give a dangerous or an exclusive tendency to the government.\n\nThe mal-administration of a democratic magistrate is a mere isolated\nfact, which only occurs during the short period for which he is elected.\nCorruption and incapacity do not act as common interests, which may\nconnect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or an incapable\nmagistrate will not concert his measures with another magistrate, simply\nbecause that individual is as corrupt and as incapable as himself; and\nthese two men will never unite their endeavors to promote the corruption\nand inaptitude of their remote posterity. The ambition and the\nmanoeuvres of the one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other.\nThe vices of a magistrate, in democratic states, are usually peculiar to\nhis own person.\n\nBut under aristocratic governments public men are swayed by the interest\nof their order, which, if it is sometimes confounded with the interests\nof the majority, is very frequently distinct from them. This interest is\nthe common and lasting bond which unites them together; it induces them\nto coalesce, and to combine their efforts in order to attain an end\nwhich does not always ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber; and it serves not only to connect the persons in authority,\nbut to unite them to a considerable portion of the community, since\na numerous body of citizens belongs to the aristocracy, without being\ninvested with official functions. The aristocratic magistrate is\ntherefore constantly supported by a portion of the community, as well as\nby the Government of which he is a member.\n\nThe common purpose which connects the interest of the magistrates in\naristocracies with that of a portion of their contemporaries identifies\nit with that of future generations; their influence belongs to the\nfuture as much as to the present. The aristocratic magistrate is urged\nat the same time toward the same point by the passions of the community,\nby his own, and I may almost add by those of his posterity. Is it, then,\nwonderful that he does not resist such repeated impulses? And indeed\naristocracies are often carried away by the spirit of their order\nwithout being corrupted by it; and they unconsciously fashion society to\ntheir own ends, and prepare it for their own descendants.\n\nThe English aristocracy is perhaps the most liberal which ever existed,\nand no body of men has ever, uninterruptedly, furnished so many\nhonorable and enlightened individuals to the government of a country. It\ncannot, however, escape observation that in the legislation of England\nthe good of the poor has been sacrificed to the advantage of the\nrich, and the rights of the majority to the privileges of the few. The\nconsequence is, that England, at the present day, combines the extremes\nof fortune in the bosom of her society, and her perils and calamities\nare almost equal to her power and her renown. *a\n\n[Footnote a: [The legislation of England for the forty years is\ncertainly not fairly open to this criticism, which was written before\nthe Reform Bill of 1832, and accordingly Great Britain has thus far\nescaped and surmounted the perils and calamities to which she seemed to\nbe exposed.]]\n\nIn the United States, where the public officers have no interests to\npromote connected with their caste, the general and constant influence\nof the Government is beneficial, although the individuals who conduct it\nare frequently unskilful and sometimes contemptible. There is indeed a\nsecret tendency in democratic institutions to render the exertions\nof the citizens subservient to the prosperity of the community,\nnotwithstanding their private vices and mistakes; whilst in aristocratic\ninstitutions there is a secret propensity which, notwithstanding the\ntalents and the virtues of those who conduct the government, leads them\nto contribute to the evils which oppress their fellow-creatures. In\naristocratic governments public men may frequently do injuries which\nthey do not intend, and in democratic states they produce advantages\nwhich they never thought of.\n\nPublic Spirit In The United States\n\nPatriotism of instinct--Patriotism of reflection--Their different\ncharacteristics--Nations ought to strive to acquire the second when the\nfirst has disappeared--Efforts of the Americans to it--Interest of the\nindividual intimately connected with that of the country.\n\nThere is one sort of patriotic attachment which principally arises from\nthat instinctive, disinterested, and undefinable feeling which connects\nthe affections of man with his birthplace. This natural fondness is\nunited to a taste for ancient customs, and to a reverence for ancestral\ntraditions of the past; those who cherish it love their country as they\nlove the mansions of their fathers. They enjoy the tranquillity which\nit affords them; they cling to the peaceful habits which they have\ncontracted within its bosom; they are attached to the reminiscences\nwhich it awakens, and they are even pleased by the state of obedience\nin which they are placed. This patriotism is sometimes stimulated\nby religious enthusiasm, and then it is capable of making the most\nprodigious efforts. It is in itself a kind of religion; it does not\nreason, but it acts from the impulse of faith and of sentiment. By\nsome nations the monarch has been regarded as a personification of the\ncountry; and the fervor of patriotism being converted into the fervor of\nloyalty, they took a sympathetic pride in his conquests, and gloried in\nhis power. At one time, under the ancient monarchy, the French felt a\nsort of satisfaction in the sense of their dependence upon the arbitrary\npleasure of their king, and they were wont to say with pride, \"We are\nthe subjects of the most powerful king in the world.\"\n\nBut, like all instinctive passions, this kind of patriotism is more apt\nto prompt transient exertion than to supply the motives of continuous\nendeavor. It may save the State in critical circumstances, but it will\nnot unfrequently allow the nation to decline in the midst of peace.\nWhilst the manners of a people are simple and its faith unshaken, whilst\nsociety is steadily based upon traditional institutions whose legitimacy\nhas never been contested, this instinctive patriotism is wont to endure.\n\nBut there is another species of attachment to a country which is more\nrational than the one we have been describing. It is perhaps less\ngenerous and less ardent, but it is more fruitful and more lasting; it\nis coeval with the spread of knowledge, it is nurtured by the laws, it\ngrows by the exercise of civil rights, and, in the end, it is confounded\nwith the personal interest of the citizen. A man comprehends the\ninfluence which the prosperity of his country has upon his own welfare;\nhe is aware that the laws authorize him to contribute his assistance\nto that prosperity, and he labors to promote it as a portion of his\ninterest in the first place, and as a portion of his right in the\nsecond.\n\nBut epochs sometimes occur, in the course of the existence of a nation,\nat which the ancient customs of a people are changed, public morality\ndestroyed, religious belief disturbed, and the spell of tradition\nbroken, whilst the diffusion of knowledge is yet imperfect, and the\ncivil rights of the community are ill secured, or confined within very\nnarrow limits. The country then assumes a dim and dubious shape in the\neyes of the citizens; they no longer behold it in the soil which they\ninhabit, for that soil is to them a dull inanimate clod; nor in the\nusages of their forefathers, which they have been taught to look upon\nas a debasing yoke; nor in religion, for of that they doubt; nor in\nthe laws, which do not originate in their own authority; nor in the\nlegislator, whom they fear and despise. The country is lost to their\nsenses, they can neither discover it under its own nor under borrowed\nfeatures, and they entrench themselves within the dull precincts of\na narrow egotism. They are emancipated from prejudice without having\nacknowledged the empire of reason; they are neither animated by the\ninstinctive patriotism of monarchical subjects nor by the thinking\npatriotism of republican citizens; but they have stopped halfway between\nthe two, in the midst of confusion and of distress.\n\nIn this predicament, to retreat is impossible; for a people cannot\nrestore the vivacity of its earlier times, any more than a man can\nreturn to the innocence and the bloom of childhood; such things may\nbe regretted, but they cannot be renewed. The only thing, then, which\nremains to be done is to proceed, and to accelerate the union of private\nwith public interests, since the period of disinterested patriotism is\ngone by forever.\n\nI am certainly very far from averring that, in order to obtain this\nresult, the exercise of political rights should be immediately granted\nto all the members of the community. But I maintain that the most\npowerful, and perhaps the only, means of interesting men in the welfare\nof their country which we still possess is to make them partakers in the\nGovernment. At the present time civic zeal seems to me to be inseparable\nfrom the exercise of political rights; and I hold that the number of\ncitizens will be found to augment or to decrease in Europe in proportion\nas those rights are extended.\n\nIn the United States the inhabitants were thrown but as yesterday upon\nthe soil which they now occupy, and they brought neither customs nor\ntraditions with them there; they meet each other for the first time\nwith no previous acquaintance; in short, the instinctive love of their\ncountry can scarcely exist in their minds; but everyone takes as zealous\nan interest in the affairs of his township, his county, and of the whole\nState, as if they were his own, because everyone, in his sphere, takes\nan active part in the government of society.\n\nThe lower orders in the United States are alive to the perception of the\ninfluence exercised by the general prosperity upon their own welfare;\nand simple as this observation is, it is one which is but too rarely\nmade by the people. But in America the people regards this prosperity as\nthe result of its own exertions; the citizen looks upon the fortune of\nthe public as his private interest, and he co-operates in its success,\nnot so much from a sense of pride or of duty, as from what I shall\nventure to term cupidity.\n\nIt is unnecessary to study the institutions and the history of the\nAmericans in order to discover the truth of this remark, for their\nmanners render it sufficiently evident. As the American participates\nin all that is done in his country, he thinks himself obliged to defend\nwhatever may be censured; for it is not only his country which is\nattacked upon these occasions, but it is himself. The consequence is,\nthat his national pride resorts to a thousand artifices, and to all the\npetty tricks of individual vanity.\n\nNothing is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life than\nthis irritable patriotism of the Americans. A stranger may be very well\ninclined to praise many of the institutions of their country, but he\nbegs permission to blame some of the peculiarities which he observes--a\npermission which is, however, inexorably refused. America is therefore a\nfree country, in which, lest anybody should be hurt by your remarks, you\nare not allowed to speak freely of private individuals, or of the\nState, of the citizens or of the authorities, of public or of private\nundertakings, or, in short, of anything at all, except it be of the\nclimate and the soil; and even then Americans will be found ready to\ndefend either the one or the other, as if they had been contrived by the\ninhabitants of the country.\n\nIn our times option must be made between the patriotism of all and the\ngovernment of a few; for the force and activity which the first confers\nare irreconcilable with the guarantees of tranquillity which the second\nfurnishes.\n\nNotion Of Rights In The United States\n\nNo great people without a notion of rights--How the notion of rights can\nbe given to people--Respect of rights in the United States--Whence it\narises.\n\nAfter the idea of virtue, I know no higher principle than that of right;\nor, to speak more accurately, these two ideas are commingled in one.\nThe idea of right is simply that of virtue introduced into the political\nworld. It is the idea of right which enabled men to define anarchy and\ntyranny; and which taught them to remain independent without arrogance,\nas well as to obey without servility. The man who submits to violence\nis debased by his compliance; but when he obeys the mandate of one\nwho possesses that right of authority which he acknowledges in a\nfellow-creature, he rises in some measure above the person who delivers\nthe command. There are no great men without virtue, and there are\nno great nations--it may almost be added that there would be no\nsociety--without the notion of rights; for what is the condition of a\nmass of rational and intelligent beings who are only united together by\nthe bond of force?\n\nI am persuaded that the only means which we possess at the present time\nof inculcating the notion of rights, and of rendering it, as it were,\npalpable to the senses, is to invest all the members of the community\nwith the peaceful exercise of certain rights: this is very clearly seen\nin children, who are men without the strength and the experience of\nmanhood. When a child begins to move in the midst of the objects which\nsurround him, he is instinctively led to turn everything which he can\nlay his hands upon to his own purposes; he has no notion of the property\nof others; but as he gradually learns the value of things, and begins\nto perceive that he may in his turn be deprived of his possessions, he\nbecomes more circumspect, and he observes those rights in others which\nhe wishes to have respected in himself. The principle which the child\nderives from the possession of his toys is taught to the man by the\nobjects which he may call his own. In America those complaints against\nproperty in general which are so frequent in Europe are never heard,\nbecause in America there are no paupers; and as everyone has property of\nhis own to defend, everyone recognizes the principle upon which he holds\nit.\n\nThe same thing occurs in the political world. In America the lowest\nclasses have conceived a very high notion of political rights, because\nthey exercise those rights; and they refrain from attacking those of\nother people, in order to ensure their own from attack. Whilst in Europe\nthe same classes sometimes recalcitrate even against the supreme power,\nthe American submits without a murmur to the authority of the pettiest\nmagistrate.\n\nThis truth is exemplified by the most trivial details of national\npeculiarities. In France very few pleasures are exclusively reserved\nfor the higher classes; the poor are admitted wherever the rich are\nreceived, and they consequently behave with propriety, and respect\nwhatever contributes to the enjoyments in which they themselves\nparticipate. In England, where wealth has a monopoly of amusement as\nwell as of power, complaints are made that whenever the poor happen to\nsteal into the enclosures which are reserved for the pleasures of the\nrich, they commit acts of wanton mischief: can this be wondered at,\nsince care has been taken that they should have nothing to lose? *b\n\n[Footnote b: [This, too, has been amended by much larger provisions for\nthe amusements of the people in public parks, gardens, museums, etc.;\nand the conduct of the people in these places of amusement has improved\nin the same proportion.]]\n\nThe government of democracy brings the notion of political rights to\nthe level of the humblest citizens, just as the dissemination of wealth\nbrings the notion of property within the reach of all the members of the\ncommunity; and I confess that, to my mind, this is one of its greatest\nadvantages. I do not assert that it is easy to teach men to exercise\npolitical rights; but I maintain that, when it is possible, the effects\nwhich result from it are highly important; and I add that, if there ever\nwas a time at which such an attempt ought to be made, that time is our\nown. It is clear that the influence of religious belief is shaken, and\nthat the notion of divine rights is declining; it is evident that\npublic morality is vitiated, and the notion of moral rights is also\ndisappearing: these are general symptoms of the substitution of argument\nfor faith, and of calculation for the impulses of sentiment. If, in the\nmidst of this general disruption, you do not succeed in connecting\nthe notion of rights with that of personal interest, which is the\nonly immutable point in the human heart, what means will you have of\ngoverning the world except by fear? When I am told that, since the laws\nare weak and the populace is wild, since passions are excited and the\nauthority of virtue is paralyzed, no measures must be taken to increase\nthe rights of the democracy, I reply, that it is for these very reasons\nthat some measures of the kind must be taken; and I am persuaded that\ngovernments are still more interested in taking them than society at\nlarge, because governments are liable to be destroyed and society cannot\nperish.\n\nI am not, however, inclined to exaggerate the example which America\nfurnishes. In those States the people are invested with political rights\nat a time when they could scarcely be abused, for the citizens were\nfew in number and simple in their manners. As they have increased, the\nAmericans have not augmented the power of the democracy, but they\nhave, if I may use the expression, extended its dominions. It cannot\nbe doubted that the moment at which political rights are granted to a\npeople that had before been without them is a very critical, though it\nbe a necessary one. A child may kill before he is aware of the value\nof life; and he may deprive another person of his property before he is\naware that his own may be taken away from him. The lower orders, when\nfirst they are invested with political rights, stand, in relation to\nthose rights, in the same position as the child does to the whole of\nnature, and the celebrated adage may then be applied to them, Homo puer\nrobustus. This truth may even be perceived in America. The States in\nwhich the citizens have enjoyed their rights longest are those in which\nthey make the best use of them.\n\nIt cannot be repeated too often that nothing is more fertile in\nprodigies than the art of being free; but there is nothing more arduous\nthan the apprenticeship of liberty. Such is not the case with despotic\ninstitutions: despotism often promises to make amends for a thousand\nprevious ills; it supports the right, it protects the oppressed, and it\nmaintains public order. The nation is lulled by the temporary prosperity\nwhich accrues to it, until it is roused to a sense of its own misery.\nLiberty, on the contrary, is generally established in the midst of\nagitation, it is perfected by civil discord, and its benefits cannot be\nappreciated until it is already old.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XIV: Advantages American Society Derive From Democracy--Part II\n\nRespect For The Law In The United States\n\nRespect of the Americans for the law--Parental affection which they\nentertain for it--Personal interest of everyone to increase the\nauthority of the law.\n\nIt is not always feasible to consult the whole people, either directly\nor indirectly, in the formation of the law; but it cannot be denied\nthat, when such a measure is possible the authority of the law is very\nmuch augmented. This popular origin, which impairs the excellence and\nthe wisdom of legislation, contributes prodigiously to increase\nits power. There is an amazing strength in the expression of the\ndetermination of a whole people, and when it declares itself the\nimagination of those who are most inclined to contest it is overawed by\nits authority. The truth of this fact is very well known by parties, and\nthey consequently strive to make out a majority whenever they can. If\nthey have not the greater number of voters on their side, they assert\nthat the true majority abstained from voting; and if they are foiled\neven there, they have recourse to the body of those persons who had no\nvotes to give.\n\nIn the United States, except slaves, servants, and paupers in the\nreceipt of relief from the townships, there is no class of persons\nwho do not exercise the elective franchise, and who do not indirectly\ncontribute to make the laws. Those who design to attack the laws must\nconsequently either modify the opinion of the nation or trample upon its\ndecision.\n\nA second reason, which is still more weighty, may be further adduced;\nin the United States everyone is personally interested in enforcing the\nobedience of the whole community to the law; for as the minority may\nshortly rally the majority to its principles, it is interested in\nprofessing that respect for the decrees of the legislator which it may\nsoon have occasion to claim for its own. However irksome an enactment\nmay be, the citizen of the United States complies with it, not only\nbecause it is the work of the majority, but because it originates in his\nown authority, and he regards it as a contract to which he is himself a\nparty.\n\nIn the United States, then, that numerous and turbulent multitude does\nnot exist which always looks upon the law as its natural enemy, and\naccordingly surveys it with fear and with fear and with distrust. It is\nimpossible, on the other hand, not to perceive that all classes display\nthe utmost reliance upon the legislation of their country, and that they\nare attached to it by a kind of parental affection.\n\nI am wrong, however, in saying all classes; for as in America the\nEuropean scale of authority is inverted, the wealthy are there placed in\na position analogous to that of the poor in the Old World, and it is\nthe opulent classes which frequently look upon the law with suspicion.\nI have already observed that the advantage of democracy is not, as has\nbeen sometimes asserted, that it protects the interests of the whole\ncommunity, but simply that it protects those of the majority. In the\nUnited States, where the poor rule, the rich have always some reason to\ndread the abuses of their power. This natural anxiety of the rich may\nproduce a sullen dissatisfaction, but society is not disturbed by it;\nfor the same reason which induces the rich to withhold their confidence\nin the legislative authority makes them obey its mandates; their wealth,\nwhich prevents them from making the law, prevents them from withstanding\nit. Amongst civilized nations revolts are rarely excited, except by such\npersons as have nothing to lose by them; and if the laws of a democracy\nare not always worthy of respect, at least they always obtain it; for\nthose who usually infringe the laws have no excuse for not complying\nwith the enactments they have themselves made, and by which they are\nthemselves benefited, whilst the citizens whose interests might be\npromoted by the infraction of them are induced, by their character and\ntheir stations, to submit to the decisions of the legislature, whatever\nthey may be. Besides which, the people in America obeys the law not\nonly because it emanates from the popular authority, but because that\nauthority may modify it in any points which may prove vexatory; a law\nis observed because it is a self-imposed evil in the first place, and an\nevil of transient duration in the second.\n\nActivity Which Pervades All The Branches Of The Body Politic In The\nUnited States; Influence Which It Exercises Upon Society\n\nMore difficult to conceive the political activity which pervades the\nUnited States than the freedom and equality which reign there--The great\nactivity which perpetually agitates the legislative bodies is only an\nepisode to the general activity--Difficult for an American to confine\nhimself to his own business--Political agitation extends to all social\nintercourse--Commercial activity of the Americans partly attributable to\nthis cause--Indirect advantages which society derives from a democratic\ngovernment.\n\nOn passing from a country in which free institutions are established to\none where they do not exist, the traveller is struck by the change; in\nthe former all is bustle and activity, in the latter everything is calm\nand motionless. In the one, amelioration and progress are the general\ntopics of inquiry; in the other, it seems as if the community only\naspired to repose in the enjoyment of the advantages which it has\nacquired. Nevertheless, the country which exerts itself so strenuously\nto promote its welfare is generally more wealthy and more prosperous\nthan that which appears to be so contented with its lot; and when we\ncompare them together, we can scarcely conceive how so many new wants\nare daily felt in the former, whilst so few seem to occur in the latter.\n\nIf this remark is applicable to those free countries in which\nmonarchical and aristocratic institutions subsist, it is still more\nstriking with regard to democratic republics. In these States it is not\nonly a portion of the people which is busied with the amelioration of\nits social condition, but the whole community is engaged in the task;\nand it is not the exigencies and the convenience of a single class for\nwhich a provision is to be made, but the exigencies and the convenience\nof all ranks of life.\n\nIt is not impossible to conceive the surpassing liberty which the\nAmericans enjoy; some idea may likewise be formed of the extreme\nequality which subsists amongst them, but the political activity which\npervades the United States must be seen in order to be understood. No\nsooner do you set foot upon the American soil than you are stunned by a\nkind of tumult; a confused clamor is heard on every side; and a thousand\nsimultaneous voices demand the immediate satisfaction of their social\nwants. Everything is in motion around you; here, the people of one\nquarter of a town are met to decide upon the building of a church;\nthere, the election of a representative is going on; a little further\nthe delegates of a district are posting to the town in order to consult\nupon some local improvements; or in another place the laborers of a\nvillage quit their ploughs to deliberate upon the project of a road or\na public school. Meetings are called for the sole purpose of declaring\ntheir disapprobation of the line of conduct pursued by the Government;\nwhilst in other assemblies the citizens salute the authorities of the\nday as the fathers of their country. Societies are formed which regard\ndrunkenness as the principal cause of the evils under which the State\nlabors, and which solemnly bind themselves to give a constant example of\ntemperance. *c\n\n[Footnote c: At the time of my stay in the United States the temperance\nsocieties already consisted of more than 270,000 members, and their\neffect had been to diminish the consumption of fermented liquors by\n500,000 gallons per annum in the State of Pennsylvania alone.]\n\nThe great political agitation of the American legislative bodies, which\nis the only kind of excitement that attracts the attention of foreign\ncountries, is a mere episode or a sort of continuation of that universal\nmovement which originates in the lowest classes of the people and\nextends successively to all the ranks of society. It is impossible to\nspend more efforts in the pursuit of enjoyment.\n\nThe cares of political life engross a most prominent place in the\noccupation of a citizen in the United States, and almost the only\npleasure of which an American has any idea is to take a part in the\nGovernment, and to discuss the part he has taken. This feeling pervades\nthe most trifling habits of life; even the women frequently attend\npublic meetings and listen to political harangues as a recreation\nafter their household labors. Debating clubs are to a certain extent a\nsubstitute for theatrical entertainments: an American cannot converse,\nbut he can discuss; and when he attempts to talk he falls into a\ndissertation. He speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting; and\nif he should chance to warm in the course of the discussion, he will\ninfallibly say, \"Gentlemen,\" to the person with whom he is conversing.\n\nIn some countries the inhabitants display a certain repugnance to avail\nthemselves of the political privileges with which the law invests them;\nit would seem that they set too high a value upon their time to spend\nit on the interests of the community; and they prefer to withdraw within\nthe exact limits of a wholesome egotism, marked out by four sunk fences\nand a quickset hedge. But if an American were condemned to confine\nhis activity to his own affairs, he would be robbed of one half of\nhis existence; he would feel an immense void in the life which he is\naccustomed to lead, and his wretchedness would be unbearable. *d I am\npersuaded that, if ever a despotic government is established in America,\nit will find it more difficult to surmount the habits which free\ninstitutions have engendered than to conquer the attachment of the\ncitizens to freedom.\n\n[Footnote d: The same remark was made at Rome under the first Caesars.\nMontesquieu somewhere alludes to the excessive despondency of certain\nRoman citizens who, after the excitement of political life, were all at\nonce flung back into the stagnation of private life.]\n\nThis ceaseless agitation which democratic government has introduced into\nthe political world influences all social intercourse. I am not sure\nthat upon the whole this is not the greatest advantage of democracy. And\nI am much less inclined to applaud it for what it does than for what\nit causes to be done. It is incontestable that the people frequently\nconducts public business very ill; but it is impossible that the lower\norders should take a part in public business without extending the\ncircle of their ideas, and without quitting the ordinary routine of\ntheir mental acquirements. The humblest individual who is called upon\nto co-operate in the government of society acquires a certain degree of\nself-respect; and as he possesses authority, he can command the services\nof minds much more enlightened than his own. He is canvassed by a\nmultitude of applicants, who seek to deceive him in a thousand different\nways, but who instruct him by their deceit. He takes a part in political\nundertakings which did not originate in his own conception, but which\ngive him a taste for undertakings of the kind. New ameliorations are\ndaily pointed out in the property which he holds in common with others,\nand this gives him the desire of improving that property which is more\npeculiarly his own. He is perhaps neither happier nor better than those\nwho came before him, but he is better informed and more active. I have\nno doubt that the democratic institutions of the United States, joined\nto the physical constitution of the country, are the cause (not\nthe direct, as is so often asserted, but the indirect cause) of the\nprodigious commercial activity of the inhabitants. It is not engendered\nby the laws, but the people learns how to promote it by the experience\nderived from legislation.\n\nWhen the opponents of democracy assert that a single individual performs\nthe duties which he undertakes much better than the government of\nthe community, it appears to me that they are perfectly right. The\ngovernment of an individual, supposing an equality of instruction on\neither side, is more consistent, more persevering, and more accurate\nthan that of a multitude, and it is much better qualified judiciously\nto discriminate the characters of the men it employs. If any deny what I\nadvance, they have certainly never seen a democratic government, or have\nformed their opinion upon very partial evidence. It is true that\neven when local circumstances and the disposition of the people allow\ndemocratic institutions to subsist, they never display a regular\nand methodical system of government. Democratic liberty is far from\naccomplishing all the projects it undertakes, with the skill of an\nadroit despotism. It frequently abandons them before they have borne\ntheir fruits, or risks them when the consequences may prove dangerous;\nbut in the end it produces more than any absolute government, and if it\ndo fewer things well, it does a greater number of things. Under its\nsway the transactions of the public administration are not nearly so\nimportant as what is done by private exertion. Democracy does not confer\nthe most skilful kind of government upon the people, but it produces\nthat which the most skilful governments are frequently unable to awaken,\nnamely, an all-pervading and restless activity, a superabundant force,\nand an energy which is inseparable from it, and which may, under\nfavorable circumstances, beget the most amazing benefits. These are the\ntrue advantages of democracy.\n\nIn the present age, when the destinies of Christendom seem to be in\nsuspense, some hasten to assail democracy as its foe whilst it is yet in\nits early growth; and others are ready with their vows of adoration for\nthis new deity which is springing forth from chaos: but both parties are\nvery imperfectly acquainted with the object of their hatred or of their\ndesires; they strike in the dark, and distribute their blows by mere\nchance.\n\nWe must first understand what the purport of society and the aim of\ngovernment is held to be. If it be your intention to confer a certain\nelevation upon the human mind, and to teach it to regard the things of\nthis world with generous feelings, to inspire men with a scorn of mere\ntemporal advantage, to give birth to living convictions, and to keep\nalive the spirit of honorable devotedness; if you hold it to be a good\nthing to refine the habits, to embellish the manners, to cultivate the\narts of a nation, and to promote the love of poetry, of beauty, and of\nrenown; if you would constitute a people not unfitted to act with power\nupon all other nations, nor unprepared for those high enterprises which,\nwhatever be the result of its efforts, will leave a name forever famous\nin time--if you believe such to be the principal object of society, you\nmust avoid the government of democracy, which would be a very uncertain\nguide to the end you have in view.\n\nBut if you hold it to be expedient to divert the moral and intellectual\nactivity of man to the production of comfort, and to the acquirement of\nthe necessaries of life; if a clear understanding be more profitable\nto man than genius; if your object be not to stimulate the virtues of\nheroism, but to create habits of peace; if you had rather witness vices\nthan crimes and are content to meet with fewer noble deeds, provided\noffences be diminished in the same proportion; if, instead of living\nin the midst of a brilliant state of society, you are contented to\nhave prosperity around you; if, in short, you are of opinion that the\nprincipal object of a Government is not to confer the greatest possible\nshare of power and of glory upon the body of the nation, but to ensure\nthe greatest degree of enjoyment and the least degree of misery to each\nof the individuals who compose it--if such be your desires, you can have\nno surer means of satisfying them than by equalizing the conditions of\nmen, and establishing democratic institutions.\n\nBut if the time be passed at which such a choice was possible, and if\nsome superhuman power impel us towards one or the other of these two\ngovernments without consulting our wishes, let us at least endeavor to\nmake the best of that which is allotted to us; and let us so inquire\ninto its good and its evil propensities as to be able to foster the\nformer and repress the latter to the utmost.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And Its Consequences--Part I\n\nChapter Summary\n\nNatural strength of the majority in democracies--Most of the American\nConstitutions have increased this strength by artificial means--How this\nhas been done--Pledged delegates--Moral power of the majority--Opinion\nas to its infallibility--Respect for its rights, how augmented in the\nUnited States.\n\nUnlimited Power Of The Majority In The United States, And Its\nConsequences\n\nThe very essence of democratic government consists in the absolute\nsovereignty of the majority; for there is nothing in democratic States\nwhich is capable of resisting it. Most of the American Constitutions\nhave sought to increase this natural strength of the majority by\nartificial means. *a\n\n[Footnote a: We observed, in examining the Federal Constitution, that\nthe efforts of the legislators of the Union had been diametrically\nopposed to the present tendency. The consequence has been that the\nFederal Government is more independent in its sphere than that of the\nStates. But the Federal Government scarcely ever interferes in any\nbut external affairs; and the governments of the State are in the\ngovernments of the States are in reality the authorities which direct\nsociety in America.]\n\nThe legislature is, of all political institutions, the one which is most\neasily swayed by the wishes of the majority. The Americans determined\nthat the members of the legislature should be elected by the people\nimmediately, and for a very brief term, in order to subject them, not\nonly to the general convictions, but even to the daily passion, of their\nconstituents. The members of both houses are taken from the same\nclass in society, and are nominated in the same manner; so that the\nmodifications of the legislative bodies are almost as rapid and quite as\nirresistible as those of a single assembly. It is to a legislature thus\nconstituted that almost all the authority of the government has been\nentrusted.\n\nBut whilst the law increased the strength of those authorities which\nof themselves were strong, it enfeebled more and more those which were\nnaturally weak. It deprived the representatives of the executive of all\nstability and independence, and by subjecting them completely to the\ncaprices of the legislature, it robbed them of the slender influence\nwhich the nature of a democratic government might have allowed them to\nretain. In several States the judicial power was also submitted to the\nelective discretion of the majority, and in all of them its existence\nwas made to depend on the pleasure of the legislative authority, since\nthe representatives were empowered annually to regulate the stipend of\nthe judges.\n\nCustom, however, has done even more than law. A proceeding which will in\nthe end set all the guarantees of representative government at naught\nis becoming more and more general in the United States; it frequently\nhappens that the electors, who choose a delegate, point out a certain\nline of conduct to him, and impose upon him a certain number of positive\nobligations which he is pledged to fulfil. With the exception of the\ntumult, this comes to the same thing as if the majority of the populace\nheld its deliberations in the market-place.\n\nSeveral other circumstances concur in rendering the power of the\nmajority in America not only preponderant, but irresistible. The moral\nauthority of the majority is partly based upon the notion that there\nis more intelligence and more wisdom in a great number of men collected\ntogether than in a single individual, and that the quantity of\nlegislators is more important than their quality. The theory of equality\nis in fact applied to the intellect of man: and human pride is thus\nassailed in its last retreat by a doctrine which the minority hesitate\nto admit, and in which they very slowly concur. Like all other powers,\nand perhaps more than all other powers, the authority of the many\nrequires the sanction of time; at first it enforces obedience by\nconstraint, but its laws are not respected until they have long been\nmaintained.\n\nThe right of governing society, which the majority supposes itself to\nderive from its superior intelligence, was introduced into the United\nStates by the first settlers, and this idea, which would be sufficient\nof itself to create a free nation, has now been amalgamated with the\nmanners of the people and the minor incidents of social intercourse.\n\nThe French, under the old monarchy, held it for a maxim (which is still\na fundamental principle of the English Constitution) that the King\ncould do no wrong; and if he did do wrong, the blame was imputed to his\nadvisers. This notion was highly favorable to habits of obedience, and\nit enabled the subject to complain of the law without ceasing to love\nand honor the lawgiver. The Americans entertain the same opinion with\nrespect to the majority.\n\nThe moral power of the majority is founded upon yet another principle,\nwhich is, that the interests of the many are to be preferred to those\nof the few. It will readily be perceived that the respect here professed\nfor the rights of the majority must naturally increase or diminish\naccording to the state of parties. When a nation is divided into\nseveral irreconcilable factions, the privilege of the majority is often\noverlooked, because it is intolerable to comply with its demands.\n\nIf there existed in America a class of citizens whom the legislating\nmajority sought to deprive of exclusive privileges which they had\npossessed for ages, and to bring down from an elevated station to the\nlevel of the ranks of the multitude, it is probable that the minority\nwould be less ready to comply with its laws. But as the United States\nwere colonized by men holding equal rank amongst themselves, there is as\nyet no natural or permanent source of dissension between the interests\nof its different inhabitants.\n\nThere are certain communities in which the persons who constitute the\nminority can never hope to draw over the majority to their side, because\nthey must then give up the very point which is at issue between them.\nThus, an aristocracy can never become a majority whilst it retains its\nexclusive privileges, and it cannot cede its privileges without ceasing\nto be an aristocracy.\n\nIn the United States political questions cannot be taken up in so\ngeneral and absolute a manner, and all parties are willing to recognize\nthe right of the majority, because they all hope to turn those rights to\ntheir own advantage at some future time. The majority therefore in that\ncountry exercises a prodigious actual authority, and a moral influence\nwhich is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist which can impede\nor so much as retard its progress, or which can induce it to heed the\ncomplaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. This state of things\nis fatal in itself and dangerous for the future.\n\nHow The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Increases In America The\nInstability Of Legislation And Administration Inherent In Democracy\nThe Americans increase the mutability of the laws which is inherent in\ndemocracy by changing the legislature every year, and by investing\nit with unbounded authority--The same effect is produced upon the\nadministration--In America social amelioration is conducted more\nenergetically but less perseveringly than in Europe.\n\nI have already spoken of the natural defects of democratic institutions,\nand they all of them increase at the exact ratio of the power of the\nmajority. To begin with the most evident of them all; the mutability\nof the laws is an evil inherent in democratic government, because it is\nnatural to democracies to raise men to power in very rapid succession.\nBut this evil is more or less sensible in proportion to the authority\nand the means of action which the legislature possesses.\n\nIn America the authority exercised by the legislative bodies is supreme;\nnothing prevents them from accomplishing their wishes with celerity, and\nwith irresistible power, whilst they are supplied by new representatives\nevery year. That is to say, the circumstances which contribute most\npowerfully to democratic instability, and which admit of the free\napplication of caprice to every object in the State, are here in full\noperation. In conformity with this principle, America is, at the present\nday, the country in the world where laws last the shortest time. Almost\nall the American constitutions have been amended within the course of\nthirty years: there is therefore not a single American State which has\nnot modified the principles of its legislation in that lapse of time.\nAs for the laws themselves, a single glance upon the archives of the\ndifferent States of the Union suffices to convince one that in America\nthe activity of the legislator never slackens. Not that the American\ndemocracy is naturally less stable than any other, but that it is\nallowed to follow its capricious propensities in the formation of the\nlaws. *b\n\n[Footnote b: The legislative acts promulgated by the State of\nMassachusetts alone, from the year 1780 to the present time, already\nfill three stout volumes; and it must not be forgotten that the\ncollection to which I allude was published in 1823, when many old laws\nwhich had fallen into disuse were omitted. The State of Massachusetts,\nwhich is not more populous than a department of France, may be\nconsidered as the most stable, the most consistent, and the most\nsagacious in its undertakings of the whole Union.]\n\nThe omnipotence of the majority, and the rapid as well as absolute\nmanner in which its decisions are executed in the United States, has not\nonly the effect of rendering the law unstable, but it exercises the same\ninfluence upon the execution of the law and the conduct of the public\nadministration. As the majority is the only power which it is important\nto court, all its projects are taken up with the greatest ardor, but no\nsooner is its attention distracted than all this ardor ceases; whilst in\nthe free States of Europe the administration is at once independent and\nsecure, so that the projects of the legislature are put into execution,\nalthough its immediate attention may be directed to other objects.\n\nIn America certain ameliorations are undertaken with much more zeal and\nactivity than elsewhere; in Europe the same ends are promoted by much\nless social effort, more continuously applied.\n\nSome years ago several pious individuals undertook to ameliorate the\ncondition of the prisons. The public was excited by the statements\nwhich they put forward, and the regeneration of criminals became a very\npopular undertaking. New prisons were built, and for the first time the\nidea of reforming as well as of punishing the delinquent formed a part\nof prison discipline. But this happy alteration, in which the public had\ntaken so hearty an interest, and which the exertions of the citizens had\nirresistibly accelerated, could not be completed in a moment. Whilst the\nnew penitentiaries were being erected (and it was the pleasure of the\nmajority that they should be terminated with all possible celerity), the\nold prisons existed, which still contained a great number of offenders.\nThese jails became more unwholesome and more corrupt in proportion as\nthe new establishments were beautified and improved, forming a contrast\nwhich may readily be understood. The majority was so eagerly employed\nin founding the new prisons that those which already existed were\nforgotten; and as the general attention was diverted to a novel object,\nthe care which had hitherto been bestowed upon the others ceased. The\nsalutary regulations of discipline were first relaxed, and afterwards\nbroken; so that in the immediate neighborhood of a prison which bore\nwitness to the mild and enlightened spirit of our time, dungeons might\nbe met with which reminded the visitor of the barbarity of the Middle\nAges.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XV: Unlimited Power Of Majority, And Its Consequences--Part II\n\nTyranny Of The Majority\n\nHow the principle of the sovereignty of the people is to be\nunderstood--Impossibility of conceiving a mixed government--The\nsovereign power must centre somewhere--Precautions to be taken to\ncontrol its action--These precautions have not been taken in the United\nStates--Consequences.\n\nI hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically\nspeaking, a people has a right to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet I\nhave asserted that all authority originates in the will of the majority.\nAm I then, in contradiction with myself?\n\nA general law--which bears the name of Justice--has been made and\nsanctioned, not only by a majority of this or that people, but by\na majority of mankind. The rights of every people are consequently\nconfined within the limits of what is just. A nation may be considered\nin the light of a jury which is empowered to represent society at large,\nand to apply the great and general law of justice. Ought such a jury,\nwhich represents society, to have more power than the society in which\nthe laws it applies originate?\n\nWhen I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which\nthe majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the sovereignty\nof the people to the sovereignty of mankind. It has been asserted that\na people can never entirely outstep the boundaries of justice and of\nreason in those affairs which are more peculiarly its own, and that\nconsequently, full power may fearlessly be given to the majority by\nwhich it is represented. But this language is that of a slave.\n\nA majority taken collectively may be regarded as a being whose opinions,\nand most frequently whose interests, are opposed to those of another\nbeing, which is styled a minority. If it be admitted that a man,\npossessing absolute power, may misuse that power by wronging his\nadversaries, why should a majority not be liable to the same reproach?\nMen are not apt to change their characters by agglomeration; nor\ndoes their patience in the presence of obstacles increase with the\nconsciousness of their strength. *c And for these reasons I can never\nwillingly invest any number of my fellow-creatures with that unlimited\nauthority which I should refuse to any one of them.\n\n[Footnote c: No one will assert that a people cannot forcibly wrong\nanother people; but parties may be looked upon as lesser nations within\na greater one, and they are aliens to each other: if, therefore, it be\nadmitted that a nation can act tyrannically towards another nation, it\ncannot be denied that a party may do the same towards another party.]\n\nI do not think that it is possible to combine several principles in the\nsame government, so as at the same time to maintain freedom, and really\nto oppose them to one another. The form of government which is usually\ntermed mixed has always appeared to me to be a mere chimera. Accurately\nspeaking there is no such thing as a mixed government (with the meaning\nusually given to that word), because in all communities some one\nprinciple of action may be discovered which preponderates over the\nothers. England in the last century, which has been more especially\ncited as an example of this form of Government, was in point of fact\nan essentially aristocratic State, although it comprised very powerful\nelements of democracy; for the laws and customs of the country were such\nthat the aristocracy could not but preponderate in the end, and subject\nthe direction of public affairs to its own will. The error arose from\ntoo much attention being paid to the actual struggle which was going\non between the nobles and the people, without considering the probable\nissue of the contest, which was in reality the important point. When\na community really has a mixed government, that is to say, when it is\nequally divided between two adverse principles, it must either pass\nthrough a revolution or fall into complete dissolution.\n\nI am therefore of opinion that some one social power must always be made\nto predominate over the others; but I think that liberty is endangered\nwhen this power is checked by no obstacles which may retard its course,\nand force it to moderate its own vehemence.\n\nUnlimited power is in itself a bad and dangerous thing; human beings\nare not competent to exercise it with discretion, and God alone can be\nomnipotent, because His wisdom and His justice are always equal to His\npower. But no power upon earth is so worthy of honor for itself, or of\nreverential obedience to the rights which it represents, that I would\nconsent to admit its uncontrolled and all-predominant authority. When I\nsee that the right and the means of absolute command are conferred on a\npeople or upon a king, upon an aristocracy or a democracy, a monarchy or\na republic, I recognize the germ of tyranny, and I journey onward to a\nland of more hopeful institutions.\n\nIn my opinion the main evil of the present democratic institutions of\nthe United States does not arise, as is often asserted in Europe, from\ntheir weakness, but from their overpowering strength; and I am not so\nmuch alarmed at the excessive liberty which reigns in that country as at\nthe very inadequate securities which exist against tyranny.\n\nWhen an individual or a party is wronged in the United States, to\nwhom can he apply for redress? If to public opinion, public opinion\nconstitutes the majority; if to the legislature, it represents the\nmajority, and implicitly obeys its injunctions; if to the executive\npower, it is appointed by the majority, and remains a passive tool in\nits hands; the public troops consist of the majority under arms; the\njury is the majority invested with the right of hearing judicial cases;\nand in certain States even the judges are elected by the majority.\nHowever iniquitous or absurd the evil of which you complain may be, you\nmust submit to it as well as you can. *d\n\n[Footnote d: A striking instance of the excesses which may be occasioned\nby the despotism of the majority occurred at Baltimore in the year 1812.\nAt that time the war was very popular in Baltimore. A journal which\nhad taken the other side of the question excited the indignation of\nthe inhabitants by its opposition. The populace assembled, broke the\nprinting-presses, and attacked the houses of the newspaper editors. The\nmilitia was called out, but no one obeyed the call; and the only means\nof saving the poor wretches who were threatened by the frenzy of the\nmob was to throw them into prison as common malefactors. But even this\nprecaution was ineffectual; the mob collected again during the night,\nthe magistrates again made a vain attempt to call out the militia, the\nprison was forced, one of the newspaper editors was killed upon the\nspot, and the others were left for dead; the guilty parties were\nacquitted by the jury when they were brought to trial.\n\nI said one day to an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, \"Be so good as to\nexplain to me how it happens that in a State founded by Quakers, and\ncelebrated for its toleration, freed blacks are not allowed to exercise\ncivil rights. They pay the taxes; is it not fair that they should have a\nvote?\"\n\n\"You insult us,\" replied my informant, \"if you imagine that our\nlegislators could have committed so gross an act of injustice and\nintolerance.\"\n\n\"What! then the blacks possess the right of voting in this county?\"\n\n\"Without the smallest doubt.\"\n\n\"How comes it, then, that at the polling-booth this morning I did not\nperceive a single negro in the whole meeting?\"\n\n\"This is not the fault of the law: the negroes have an undisputed right\nof voting, but they voluntarily abstain from making their appearance.\"\n\n\"A very pretty piece of modesty on their parts!\" rejoined I.\n\n\"Why, the truth is, that they are not disinclined to vote, but they are\nafraid of being maltreated; in this country the law is sometimes unable\nto maintain its authority without the support of the majority. But in\nthis case the majority entertains very strong prejudices against the\nblacks, and the magistrates are unable to protect them in the exercise\nof their legal privileges.\"\n\n\"What! then the majority claims the right not only of making the laws,\nbut of breaking the laws it has made?\"]\n\nIf, on the other hand, a legislative power could be so constituted as\nto represent the majority without necessarily being the slave of its\npassions; an executive, so as to retain a certain degree of uncontrolled\nauthority; and a judiciary, so as to remain independent of the two other\npowers; a government would be formed which would still be democratic\nwithout incurring any risk of tyrannical abuse.\n\nI do not say that tyrannical abuses frequently occur in America at the\npresent day, but I maintain that no sure barrier is established against\nthem, and that the causes which mitigate the government are to be found\nin the circumstances and the manners of the country more than in its\nlaws.\n\nEffects Of The Unlimited Power Of The Majority Upon The Arbitrary\nAuthority Of The American Public Officers\n\nLiberty left by the American laws to public officers within a certain\nsphere--Their power.\n\n\nA distinction must be drawn between tyranny and arbitrary power.\nTyranny may be exercised by means of the law, and in that case it is\nnot arbitrary; arbitrary power may be exercised for the good of the\ncommunity at large, in which case it is not tyrannical. Tyranny usually\nemploys arbitrary means, but, if necessary, it can rule without them.\n\nIn the United States the unbounded power of the majority, which is\nfavorable to the legal despotism of the legislature, is likewise\nfavorable to the arbitrary authority of the magistrate. The majority has\nan entire control over the law when it is made and when it is executed;\nand as it possesses an equal authority over those who are in power and\nthe community at large, it considers public officers as its passive\nagents, and readily confides the task of serving its designs to their\nvigilance. The details of their office and the privileges which they are\nto enjoy are rarely defined beforehand; but the majority treats them as\na master does his servants when they are always at work in his sight,\nand he has the power of directing or reprimanding them at every instant.\n\nIn general the American functionaries are far more independent than the\nFrench civil officers within the sphere which is prescribed to them.\nSometimes, even, they are allowed by the popular authority to exceed\nthose bounds; and as they are protected by the opinion, and backed by\nthe co-operation, of the majority, they venture upon such manifestations\nof their power as astonish a European. By this means habits are formed\nin the heart of a free country which may some day prove fatal to its\nliberties.\n\nPower Exercised By The Majority In America Upon Opinion\n\nIn America, when the majority has once irrevocably decided a question,\nall discussion ceases--Reason of this--Moral power exercised by the\nmajority upon opinion--Democratic republics have deprived despotism of\nits physical instruments--Their despotism sways the minds of men.\n\nIt is in the examination of the display of public opinion in the United\nStates that we clearly perceive how far the power of the majority\nsurpasses all the powers with which we are acquainted in Europe.\nIntellectual principles exercise an influence which is so invisible, and\noften so inappreciable, that they baffle the toils of oppression. At the\npresent time the most absolute monarchs in Europe are unable to prevent\ncertain notions, which are opposed to their authority, from circulating\nin secret throughout their dominions, and even in their courts. Such\nis not the case in America; as long as the majority is still undecided,\ndiscussion is carried on; but as soon as its decision is irrevocably\npronounced, a submissive silence is observed, and the friends, as well\nas the opponents, of the measure unite in assenting to its propriety.\nThe reason of this is perfectly clear: no monarch is so absolute as to\ncombine all the powers of society in his own hands, and to conquer all\nopposition with the energy of a majority which is invested with the\nright of making and of executing the laws.\n\nThe authority of a king is purely physical, and it controls the actions\nof the subject without subduing his private will; but the majority\npossesses a power which is physical and moral at the same time; it acts\nupon the will as well as upon the actions of men, and it represses not\nonly all contest, but all controversy. I know no country in which there\nis so little true independence of mind and freedom of discussion as in\nAmerica. In any constitutional state in Europe every sort of religious\nand political theory may be advocated and propagated abroad; for there\nis no country in Europe so subdued by any single authority as not to\ncontain citizens who are ready to protect the man who raises his voice\nin the cause of truth from the consequences of his hardihood. If he is\nunfortunate enough to live under an absolute government, the people\nis upon his side; if he inhabits a free country, he may find a shelter\nbehind the authority of the throne, if he require one. The aristocratic\npart of society supports him in some countries, and the democracy in\nothers. But in a nation where democratic institutions exist, organized\nlike those of the United States, there is but one sole authority, one\nsingle element of strength and of success, with nothing beyond it.\n\nIn America the majority raises very formidable barriers to the liberty\nof opinion: within these barriers an author may write whatever he\npleases, but he will repent it if he ever step beyond them. Not that he\nis exposed to the terrors of an auto-da-fe, but he is tormented by\nthe slights and persecutions of daily obloquy. His political career is\nclosed forever, since he has offended the only authority which is\nable to promote his success. Every sort of compensation, even that\nof celebrity, is refused to him. Before he published his opinions he\nimagined that he held them in common with many others; but no sooner has\nhe declared them openly than he is loudly censured by his overbearing\nopponents, whilst those who think without having the courage to speak,\nlike him, abandon him in silence. He yields at length, oppressed by the\ndaily efforts he has been making, and he subsides into silence, as if he\nwas tormented by remorse for having spoken the truth.\n\nFetters and headsmen were the coarse instruments which tyranny formerly\nemployed; but the civilization of our age has refined the arts of\ndespotism which seemed, however, to have been sufficiently perfected\nbefore. The excesses of monarchical power had devised a variety of\nphysical means of oppression: the democratic republics of the present\nday have rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind as that will\nwhich it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of an individual\ndespot the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul, and the soul\nescaped the blows which were directed against it and rose superior to\nthe attempt; but such is not the course adopted by tyranny in democratic\nrepublics; there the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The\nsovereign can no longer say, \"You shall think as I do on pain of death;\"\nbut he says, \"You are free to think differently from me, and to retain\nyour life, your property, and all that you possess; but if such be your\ndetermination, you are henceforth an alien among your people. You may\nretain your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will\nnever be chosen by your fellow-citizens if you solicit their suffrages,\nand they will affect to scorn you if you solicit their esteem. You will\nremain among men, but you will be deprived of the rights of mankind.\nYour fellow-creatures will shun you like an impure being, and those who\nare most persuaded of your innocence will abandon you too, lest they\nshould be shunned in their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your\nlife, but it is an existence in comparably worse than death.\"\n\nMonarchical institutions have thrown an odium upon despotism; let us\nbeware lest democratic republics should restore oppression, and should\nrender it less odious and less degrading in the eyes of the many, by\nmaking it still more onerous to the few.\n\nWorks have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World\nexpressly intended to censure the vices and deride the follies of the\ntimes; Labruyere inhabited the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his\nchapter upon the Great, and Moliere criticised the courtiers in the very\npieces which were acted before the Court. But the ruling power in the\nUnited States is not to be made game of; the smallest reproach irritates\nits sensibility, and the slightest joke which has any foundation in\ntruth renders it indignant; from the style of its language to the more\nsolid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject\nof encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape from this\ntribute of adulation to his fellow-citizens. The majority lives in the\nperpetual practice of self-applause, and there are certain truths which\nthe Americans can only learn from strangers or from experience.\n\nIf great writers have not at present existed in America, the reason\nis very simply given in these facts; there can be no literary genius\nwithout freedom of opinion, and freedom of opinion does not exist in\nAmerica. The Inquisition has never been able to prevent a vast number\nof anti-religious books from circulating in Spain. The empire of the\nmajority succeeds much better in the United States, since it actually\nremoves the wish of publishing them. Unbelievers are to be met with in\nAmerica, but, to say the truth, there is no public organ of infidelity.\nAttempts have been made by some governments to protect the morality of\nnations by prohibiting licentious books. In the United States no one is\npunished for this sort of works, but no one is induced to write them;\nnot because all the citizens are immaculate in their manners, but\nbecause the majority of the community is decent and orderly.\n\n\nIn these cases the advantages derived from the exercise of this power\nare unquestionable, and I am simply discussing the nature of the\npower itself. This irresistible authority is a constant fact, and its\njudicious exercise is an accidental occurrence.\n\nEffects Of The Tyranny Of The Majority Upon The National Character Of\nThe Americans\n\nEffects of the tyranny of the majority more sensibly felt hitherto in\nthe manners than in the conduct of society--They check the development\nof leading characters--Democratic republics organized like the United\nStates bring the practice of courting favor within the reach of the\nmany--Proofs of this spirit in the United States--Why there is more\npatriotism in the people than in those who govern in its name.\n\nThe tendencies which I have just alluded to are as yet very slightly\nperceptible in political society, but they already begin to exercise an\nunfavorable influence upon the national character of the Americans. I\nam inclined to attribute the singular paucity of distinguished political\ncharacters to the ever-increasing activity of the despotism of the\nmajority in the United States. When the American Revolution broke out\nthey arose in great numbers, for public opinion then served, not to\ntyrannize over, but to direct the exertions of individuals. Those\ncelebrated men took a full part in the general agitation of mind common\nat that period, and they attained a high degree of personal fame, which\nwas reflected back upon the nation, but which was by no means borrowed\nfrom it.\n\nIn absolute governments the great nobles who are nearest to the throne\nflatter the passions of the sovereign, and voluntarily truckle to\nhis caprices. But the mass of the nation does not degrade itself\nby servitude: it often submits from weakness, from habit, or from\nignorance, and sometimes from loyalty. Some nations have been known to\nsacrifice their own desires to those of the sovereign with pleasure and\nwith pride, thus exhibiting a sort of independence in the very act of\nsubmission. These peoples are miserable, but they are not degraded.\nThere is a great difference between doing what one does not approve and\nfeigning to approve what one does; the one is the necessary case of a\nweak person, the other befits the temper of a lackey.\n\nIn free countries, where everyone is more or less called upon to give\nhis opinion in the affairs of state; in democratic republics, where\npublic life is incessantly commingled with domestic affairs, where the\nsovereign authority is accessible on every side, and where its attention\ncan almost always be attracted by vociferation, more persons are to\nbe met with who speculate upon its foibles and live at the cost of its\npassions than in absolute monarchies. Not because men are naturally\nworse in these States than elsewhere, but the temptation is stronger,\nand of easier access at the same time. The result is a far more\nextensive debasement of the characters of citizens.\n\n\nDemocratic republics extend the practice of currying favor with the\nmany, and they introduce it into a greater number of classes at once:\nthis is one of the most serious reproaches that can be addressed to\nthem. In democratic States organized on the principles of the American\nrepublics, this is more especially the case, where the authority of the\nmajority is so absolute and so irresistible that a man must give up his\nrights as a citizen, and almost abjure his quality as a human being, if\nte intends to stray from the track which it lays down.\n\nIn that immense crowd which throngs the avenues to power in the United\nStates I found very few men who displayed any of that manly candor and\nthat masculine independence of opinion which frequently distinguished\nthe Americans in former times, and which constitutes the leading feature\nin distinguished characters, wheresoever they may be found. It seems, at\nfirst sight, as if all the minds of the Americans were formed upon one\nmodel, so accurately do they correspond in their manner of judging. A\nstranger does, indeed, sometimes meet with Americans who dissent from\nthese rigorous formularies; with men who deplore the defects of the\nlaws, the mutability and the ignorance of democracy; who even go so far\nas to observe the evil tendencies which impair the national character,\nand to point out such remedies as it might be possible to apply; but\nno one is there to hear these things besides yourself, and you, to whom\nthese secret reflections are confided, are a stranger and a bird of\npassage. They are very ready to communicate truths which are useless to\nyou, but they continue to hold a different language in public.\n\nIf ever these lines are read in America, I am well assured of two\nthings: in the first place, that all who peruse them will raise their\nvoices to condemn me; and in the second place, that very many of them\nwill acquit me at the bottom of their conscience.\n\nI have heard of patriotism in the United States, and it is a virtue\nwhich may be found among the people, but never among the leaders of\nthe people. This may be explained by analogy; despotism debases the\noppressed much more than the oppressor: in absolute monarchies the king\nhas often great virtues, but the courtiers are invariably servile. It is\ntrue that the American courtiers do not say \"Sire,\" or \"Your Majesty\"--a\ndistinction without a difference. They are forever talking of the\nnatural intelligence of the populace they serve; they do not debate the\nquestion as to which of the virtues of their master is pre-eminently\nworthy of admiration, for they assure him that he possesses all the\nvirtues under heaven without having acquired them, or without caring to\nacquire them; they do not give him their daughters and their wives to\nbe raised at his pleasure to the rank of his concubines, but, by\nsacrificing their opinions, they prostitute themselves. Moralists and\nphilosophers in America are not obliged to conceal their opinions under\nthe veil of allegory; but, before they venture upon a harsh truth,\nthey say, \"We are aware that the people which we are addressing is too\nsuperior to all the weaknesses of human nature to lose the command of\nits temper for an instant; and we should not hold this language if\nwe were not speaking to men whom their virtues and their intelligence\nrender more worthy of freedom than all the rest of the world.\" It would\nhave been impossible for the sycophants of Louis XIV to flatter more\ndexterously. For my part, I am persuaded that in all governments,\nwhatever their nature may be, servility will cower to force, and\nadulation will cling to power. The only means of preventing men from\ndegrading themselves is to invest no one with that unlimited authority\nwhich is the surest method of debasing them.\n\nThe Greatest Dangers Of The American Republics Proceed From The\nUnlimited Power Of The Majority\n\nDemocratic republics liable to perish from a misuse of their power, and\nnot by impotence--The Governments of the American republics are\nmore centralized and more energetic than those of the monarchies of\nEurope--Dangers resulting from this--Opinions of Hamilton and Jefferson\nupon this point.\n\nGovernments usually fall a sacrifice to impotence or to tyranny. In\nthe former case their power escapes from them; it is wrested from their\ngrasp in the latter. Many observers, who have witnessed the anarchy of\ndemocratic States, have imagined that the government of those States was\nnaturally weak and impotent. The truth is, that when once hostilities\nare begun between parties, the government loses its control over\nsociety. But I do not think that a democratic power is naturally without\nforce or without resources: say, rather, that it is almost always by\nthe abuse of its force and the misemployment of its resources that a\ndemocratic government fails. Anarchy is almost always produced by its\ntyranny or its mistakes, but not by its want of strength.\n\nIt is important not to confound stability with force, or the greatness\nof a thing with its duration. In democratic republics, the power which\ndirects *e society is not stable; for it often changes hands and\nassumes a new direction. But whichever way it turns, its force is almost\nirresistible. The Governments of the American republics appear to me to\nbe as much centralized as those of the absolute monarchies of Europe,\nand more energetic than they are. I do not, therefore, imagine that they\nwill perish from weakness. *f\n\n[Footnote e: This power may be centred in an assembly, in which case\nit will be strong without being stable; or it may be centred in an\nindividual, in which case it will be less strong, but more stable.]\n\n[Footnote f: I presume that it is scarcely necessary to remind the\nreader here, as well as throughout the remainder of this chapter, that\nI am speaking, not of the Federal Government, but of the several\ngovernments of each State, which the majority controls at its pleasure.]\n\nIf ever the free institutions of America are destroyed, that event may\nbe attributed to the unlimited authority of the majority, which may at\nsome future time urge the minorities to desperation, and oblige them to\nhave recourse to physical force. Anarchy will then be the result, but it\nwill have been brought about by despotism.\n\nMr. Hamilton expresses the same opinion in the \"Federalist,\" No. 51.\n\"It is of great importance in a republic not only to guard the society\nagainst the oppression of its rulers, but to guard one part of the\nsociety against the injustice of the other part. Justice is the end of\ngovernment. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been, and ever\nwill be, pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the\npursuit. In a society, under the forms of which the stronger faction can\nreadily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said\nto reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker individual is not\nsecured against the violence of the stronger: and as in the latter state\neven the stronger individuals are prompted by the uncertainty of their\ncondition to submit to a government which may protect the weak as well\nas themselves, so in the former state will the more powerful factions be\ngradually induced by a like motive to wish for a government which will\nprotect all parties, the weaker as well as the more powerful. It can be\nlittle doubted that, if the State of Rhode Island was separated from\nthe Confederacy and left to itself, the insecurity of right under the\npopular form of government within such narrow limits would be displayed\nby such reiterated oppressions of the factious majorities, that some\npower altogether independent of the people would soon be called for by\nthe voice of the very factions whose misrule had proved the necessity of\nit.\"\n\nJefferson has also thus expressed himself in a letter to Madison: *g\n\"The executive power in our Government is not the only, perhaps not even\nthe principal, object of my solicitude. The tyranny of the Legislature\nis really the danger most to be feared, and will continue to be so for\nmany years to come. The tyranny of the executive power will come in its\nturn, but at a more distant period.\" I am glad to cite the opinion\nof Jefferson upon this subject rather than that of another, because I\nconsider him to be the most powerful advocate democracy has ever sent\nforth.\n\n[Footnote g: March 15, 1789.]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI: Causes Mitigating Tyranny In The United States--Part I\n\nChapter Summary\n\nThe national majority does not pretend to conduct all business--Is\nobliged to employ the town and county magistrates to execute its supreme\ndecisions.\n\nI have already pointed out the distinction which is to be made between\na centralized government and a centralized administration. The former\nexists in America, but the latter is nearly unknown there. If the\ndirecting power of the American communities had both these instruments\nof government at its disposal, and united the habit of executing its own\ncommands to the right of commanding; if, after having established the\ngeneral principles of government, it descended to the details of public\nbusiness; and if, having regulated the great interests of the country,\nit could penetrate into the privacy of individual interests, freedom\nwould soon be banished from the New World.\n\nBut in the United States the majority, which so frequently displays the\ntastes and the propensities of a despot, is still destitute of the more\nperfect instruments of tyranny. In the American republics the activity\nof the central Government has never as yet been extended beyond a\nlimited number of objects sufficiently prominent to call forth its\nattention. The secondary affairs of society have never been regulated\nby its authority, and nothing has hitherto betrayed its desire of\ninterfering in them. The majority is become more and more absolute, but\nit has not increased the prerogatives of the central government; those\ngreat prerogatives have been confined to a certain sphere; and although\nthe despotism of the majority may be galling upon one point, it cannot\nbe said to extend to all. However the predominant party in the nation\nmay be carried away by its passions, however ardent it may be in the\npursuit of its projects, it cannot oblige all the citizens to comply\nwith its desires in the same manner and at the same time throughout the\ncountry. When the central Government which represents that majority has\nissued a decree, it must entrust the execution of its will to agents,\nover whom it frequently has no control, and whom it cannot perpetually\ndirect. The townships, municipal bodies, and counties may therefore be\nlooked upon as concealed break-waters, which check or part the tide of\npopular excitement. If an oppressive law were passed, the liberties of\nthe people would still be protected by the means by which that law would\nbe put in execution: the majority cannot descend to the details and (as\nI will venture to style them) the puerilities of administrative tyranny.\nNor does the people entertain that full consciousness of its authority\nwhich would prompt it to interfere in these matters; it knows the\nextent of its natural powers, but it is unacquainted with the increased\nresources which the art of government might furnish.\n\nThis point deserves attention, for if a democratic republic similar to\nthat of the United States were ever founded in a country where the power\nof a single individual had previously subsisted, and the effects of a\ncentralized administration had sunk deep into the habits and the laws\nof the people, I do not hesitate to assert, that in that country a more\ninsufferable despotism would prevail than any which now exists in the\nmonarchical States of Europe, or indeed than any which could be found on\nthis side of the confines of Asia.\n\nThe Profession Of The Law In The United States Serves To Counterpoise\nThe Democracy\n\nUtility of discriminating the natural propensities of the members of\nthe legal profession--These men called upon to act a prominent part in\nfuture society--In what manner the peculiar pursuits of lawyers give an\naristocratic turn to their ideas--Accidental causes which may check this\ntendency--Ease with which the aristocracy coalesces with legal men--Use\nof lawyers to a despot--The profession of the law constitutes the only\naristocratic element with which the natural elements of democracy will\ncombine--Peculiar causes which tend to give an aristocratic turn of mind\nto the English and American lawyers--The aristocracy of America is\non the bench and at the bar--Influence of lawyers upon American\nsociety--Their peculiar magisterial habits affect the legislature, the\nadministration, and even the people.\n\nIn visiting the Americans and in studying their laws we perceive that\nthe authority they have entrusted to members of the legal profession,\nand the influence which these individuals exercise in the Government, is\nthe most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy.\nThis effect seems to me to result from a general cause which it is\nuseful to investigate, since it may produce analogous consequences\nelsewhere.\n\nThe members of the legal profession have taken an important part in all\nthe vicissitudes of political society in Europe during the last five\nhundred years. At one time they have been the instruments of those\nwho were invested with political authority, and at another they have\nsucceeded in converting political authorities into their instrument. In\nthe Middle Ages they afforded a powerful support to the Crown, and since\nthat period they have exerted themselves to the utmost to limit the\nroyal prerogative. In England they have contracted a close alliance with\nthe aristocracy; in France they have proved to be the most dangerous\nenemies of that class. It is my object to inquire whether, under all\nthese circumstances, the members of the legal profession have been\nswayed by sudden and momentary impulses; or whether they have been\nimpelled by principles which are inherent in their pursuits, and which\nwill always recur in history. I am incited to this investigation by\nreflecting that this particular class of men will most likely play a\nprominent part in that order of things to which the events of our time\nare giving birth.\n\nMen who have more especially devoted themselves to legal pursuits derive\nfrom those occupations certain habits of order, a taste for formalities,\nand a kind of instinctive regard for the regular connection of ideas,\nwhich naturally render them very hostile to the revolutionary spirit and\nthe unreflecting passions of the multitude.\n\nThe special information which lawyers derive from their studies ensures\nthem a separate station in society, and they constitute a sort of\nprivileged body in the scale of intelligence. This notion of their\nsuperiority perpetually recurs to them in the practice of their\nprofession: they are the masters of a science which is necessary, but\nwhich is not very generally known; they serve as arbiters between the\ncitizens; and the habit of directing the blind passions of parties in\nlitigation to their purpose inspires them with a certain contempt\nfor the judgment of the multitude. To this it may be added that they\nnaturally constitute a body, not by any previous understanding, or by an\nagreement which directs them to a common end; but the analogy of their\nstudies and the uniformity of their proceedings connect their minds\ntogether, as much as a common interest could combine their endeavors.\n\nA portion of the tastes and of the habits of the aristocracy may\nconsequently be discovered in the characters of men in the profession of\nthe law. They participate in the same instinctive love of order and of\nformalities; and they entertain the same repugnance to the actions of\nthe multitude, and the same secret contempt of the government of the\npeople. I do not mean to say that the natural propensities of lawyers\nare sufficiently strong to sway them irresistibly; for they, like most\nother men, are governed by their private interests and the advantages of\nthe moment.\n\nIn a state of society in which the members of the legal profession are\nprevented from holding that rank in the political world which they enjoy\nin private life, we may rest assured that they will be the foremost\nagents of revolution. But it must then be inquired whether the cause\nwhich induces them to innovate and to destroy is accidental, or whether\nit belongs to some lasting purpose which they entertain. It is true that\nlawyers mainly contributed to the overthrow of the French monarchy in\n1789; but it remains to be seen whether they acted thus because they had\nstudied the laws, or because they were prohibited from co-operating in\nthe work of legislation.\n\nFive hundred years ago the English nobles headed the people, and spoke\nin its name; at the present time the aristocracy supports the throne,\nand defends the royal prerogative. But aristocracy has, notwithstanding\nthis, its peculiar instincts and propensities. We must be careful not\nto confound isolated members of a body with the body itself. In all\nfree governments, of whatsoever form they may be, members of the legal\nprofession will be found at the head of all parties. The same remark\nis also applicable to the aristocracy; for almost all the democratic\nconvulsions which have agitated the world have been directed by nobles.\n\nA privileged body can never satisfy the ambition of all its members; it\nhas always more talents and more passions to content and to employ than\nit can find places; so that a considerable number of individuals are\nusually to be met with who are inclined to attack those very privileges\nwhich they find it impossible to turn to their own account.\n\nI do not, then, assert that all the members of the legal profession are\nat all times the friends of order and the opponents of innovation, but\nmerely that most of them usually are so. In a community in which lawyers\nare allowed to occupy, without opposition, that high station which\nnaturally belongs to them, their general spirit will be eminently\nconservative and anti-democratic. When an aristocracy excludes the\nleaders of that profession from its ranks, it excites enemies which\nare the more formidable to its security as they are independent of the\nnobility by their industrious pursuits; and they feel themselves to be\nits equal in point of intelligence, although they enjoy less opulence\nand less power. But whenever an aristocracy consents to impart some of\nits privileges to these same individuals, the two classes coalesce very\nreadily, and assume, as it were, the consistency of a single order of\nfamily interests.\n\nI am, in like manner, inclined to believe that a monarch will always\nbe able to convert legal practitioners into the most serviceable\ninstruments of his authority. There is a far greater affinity between\nthis class of individuals and the executive power than there is between\nthem and the people; just as there is a greater natural affinity between\nthe nobles and the monarch than between the nobles and the people,\nalthough the higher orders of society have occasionally resisted the\nprerogative of the Crown in concert with the lower classes.\n\nLawyers are attached to public order beyond every other consideration,\nand the best security of public order is authority. It must not be\nforgotten that, if they prize the free institutions of their country\nmuch, they nevertheless value the legality of those institutions far\nmore: they are less afraid of tyranny than of arbitrary power; and\nprovided that the legislature take upon itself to deprive men of their\nindependence, they are not dissatisfied.\n\nI am therefore convinced that the prince who, in presence of an\nencroaching democracy, should endeavor to impair the judicial authority\nin his dominions, and to diminish the political influence of lawyers,\nwould commit a great mistake. He would let slip the substance\nof authority to grasp at the shadow. He would act more wisely in\nintroducing men connected with the law into the government; and if he\nentrusted them with the conduct of a despotic power, bearing some marks\nof violence, that power would most likely assume the external features\nof justice and of legality in their hands.\n\n\nThe government of democracy is favorable to the political power of\nlawyers; for when the wealthy, the noble, and the prince are excluded\nfrom the government, they are sure to occupy the highest stations, in\ntheir own right, as it were, since they are the only men of information\nand sagacity, beyond the sphere of the people, who can be the object of\nthe popular choice. If, then, they are led by their tastes to combine\nwith the aristocracy and to support the Crown, they are naturally\nbrought into contact with the people by their interests. They like the\ngovernment of democracy, without participating in its propensities\nand without imitating its weaknesses; whence they derive a twofold\nauthority, from it and over it. The people in democratic states does not\nmistrust the members of the legal profession, because it is well known\nthat they are interested in serving the popular cause; and it listens\nto them without irritation, because it does not attribute to them any\nsinister designs. The object of lawyers is not, indeed, to overthrow the\ninstitutions of democracy, but they constantly endeavor to give it an\nimpulse which diverts it from its real tendency, by means which are\nforeign to its nature. Lawyers belong to the people by birth and\ninterest, to the aristocracy by habit and by taste, and they may be\nlooked upon as the natural bond and connecting link of the two great\nclasses of society.\n\nThe profession of the law is the only aristocratic element which can be\namalgamated without violence with the natural elements of democracy, and\nwhich can be advantageously and permanently combined with them. I am\nnot unacquainted with the defects which are inherent in the character\nof that body of men; but without this admixture of lawyer-like\nsobriety with the democratic principle, I question whether democratic\ninstitutions could long be maintained, and I cannot believe that a\nrepublic could subsist at the present time if the influence of lawyers\nin public business did not increase in proportion to the power of the\npeople.\n\nThis aristocratic character, which I hold to be common to the legal\nprofession, is much more distinctly marked in the United States and in\nEngland than in any other country. This proceeds not only from the legal\nstudies of the English and American lawyers, but from the nature of\nthe legislation, and the position which those persons occupy in the\ntwo countries. The English and the Americans have retained the law of\nprecedents; that is to say, they continue to found their legal opinions\nand the decisions of their courts upon the opinions and the decisions of\ntheir forefathers. In the mind of an English or American lawyer a taste\nand a reverence for what is old is almost always united to a love of\nregular and lawful proceedings.\n\nThis predisposition has another effect upon the character of the legal\nprofession and upon the general course of society. The English and\nAmerican lawyers investigate what has been done; the French advocate\ninquires what should have been done; the former produce precedents,\nthe latter reasons. A French observer is surprised to hear how often\nan English dr an American lawyer quotes the opinions of others, and how\nlittle he alludes to his own; whilst the reverse occurs in France. There\nthe most trifling litigation is never conducted without the introduction\nof an entire system of ideas peculiar to the counsel employed; and the\nfundamental principles of law are discussed in order to obtain a\nperch of land by the decision of the court. This abnegation of his own\nopinion, and this implicit deference to the opinion of his forefathers,\nwhich are common to the English and American lawyer, this subjection of\nthought which he is obliged to profess, necessarily give him more timid\nhabits and more sluggish inclinations in England and America than in\nFrance.\n\nThe French codes are often difficult of comprehension, but they can be\nread by every one; nothing, on the other hand, can be more impenetrable\nto the uninitiated than a legislation founded upon precedents. The\nindispensable want of legal assistance which is felt in England and in\nthe United States, and the high opinion which is generally entertained\nof the ability of the legal profession, tend to separate it more and\nmore from the people, and to place it in a distinct class. The French\nlawyer is simply a man extensively acquainted with the statutes of his\ncountry; but the English or American lawyer resembles the hierophants of\nEgypt, for, like them, he is the sole interpreter of an occult science.\n\nThe station which lawyers occupy in England and America exercises no\nless an influence upon their habits and their opinions. The English\naristocracy, which has taken care to attract to its sphere whatever is\nat all analogous to itself, has conferred a high degree of importance\nand of authority upon the members of the legal profession. In English\nsociety lawyers do not occupy the first rank, but they are contented\nwith the station assigned to them; they constitute, as it were, the\nyounger branch of the English aristocracy, and they are attached to\ntheir elder brothers, although they do not enjoy all their privileges.\nThe English lawyers consequently mingle the taste and the ideas of the\naristocratic circles in which they move with the aristocratic interests\nof their profession.\n\nAnd indeed the lawyer-like character which I am endeavoring to depict is\nmost distinctly to be met with in England: there laws are esteemed not\nso much because they are good as because they are old; and if it be\nnecessary to modify them in any respect, or to adapt them the\nchanges which time operates in society, recourse is had to the most\ninconceivable contrivances in order to uphold the traditionary fabric,\nand to maintain that nothing has been done which does not square with\nthe intentions and complete the labors of former generations. The\nvery individuals who conduct these changes disclaim all intention of\ninnovation, and they had rather resort to absurd expedients than plead\nguilty to so great a crime. This spirit appertains more especially to\nthe English lawyers; they seem indifferent to the real meaning of what\nthey treat, and they direct all their attention to the letter, seeming\ninclined to infringe the rules of common sense and of humanity rather\nthan to swerve one title from the law. The English legislation may be\ncompared to the stock of an old tree, upon which lawyers have engrafted\nthe most various shoots, with the hope that, although their fruits may\ndiffer, their foliage at least will be confounded with the venerable\ntrunk which supports them all.\n\nIn America there are no nobles or men of letters, and the people is apt\nto mistrust the wealthy; lawyers consequently form the highest political\nclass, and the most cultivated circle of society. They have therefore\nnothing to gain by innovation, which adds a conservative interest to\ntheir natural taste for public order. If I were asked where I place the\nAmerican aristocracy, I should reply without hesitation that it is not\ncomposed of the rich, who are united together by no common tie, but that\nit occupies the judicial bench and the bar.\n\nThe more we reflect upon all that occurs in the United States the more\nshall we be persuaded that the lawyers as a body form the most powerful,\nif not the only, counterpoise to the democratic element. In that country\nwe perceive how eminently the legal profession is qualified by its\npowers, and even by its defects, to neutralize the vices which are\ninherent in popular government. When the American people is intoxicated\nby passion, or carried away by the impetuosity of its ideas, it is\nchecked and stopped by the almost invisible influence of its legal\ncounsellors, who secretly oppose their aristocratic propensities to its\ndemocratic instincts, their superstitious attachment to what is antique\nto its love of novelty, their narrow views to its immense designs, and\ntheir habitual procrastination to its ardent impatience.\n\nThe courts of justice are the most visible organs by which the legal\nprofession is enabled to control the democracy. The judge is a lawyer,\nwho, independently of the taste for regularity and order which he has\ncontracted in the study of legislation, derives an additional love of\nstability from his own inalienable functions. His legal attainments have\nalready raised him to a distinguished rank amongst his fellow-citizens;\nhis political power completes the distinction of his station, and gives\nhim the inclinations natural to privileged classes.\n\nArmed with the power of declaring the laws to be unconstitutional, *a\nthe American magistrate perpetually interferes in political affairs. He\ncannot force the people to make laws, but at least he can oblige it not\nto disobey its own enactments; or to act inconsistently with its own\nprinciples. I am aware that a secret tendency to diminish the judicial\npower exists in the United States, and by most of the constitutions of\nthe several States the Government can, upon the demand of the two houses\nof the legislature, remove the judges from their station. By some other\nconstitutions the members of the tribunals are elected, and they are\neven subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict that these\ninnovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal consequences,\nand that it will be found out at some future period that the attack\nwhich is made upon the judicial power has affected the democratic\nrepublic itself.\n\n[Footnote a: See chapter VI. on the \"Judicial Power in the United\nStates.\"]\n\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the legal spirit of which I have\nbeen speaking has been confined, in the United States, to the courts of\njustice; it extends far beyond them. As the lawyers constitute the only\nenlightened class which the people does not mistrust, they are naturally\ncalled upon to occupy most of the public stations. They fill the\nlegislative assemblies, and they conduct the administration; they\nconsequently exercise a powerful influence upon the formation of the\nlaw, and upon its execution. The lawyers are, however, obliged to yield\nto the current of public opinion, which is too strong for them to resist\nit, but it is easy to find indications of what their conduct would be if\nthey were free to act as they chose. The Americans, who have made such\ncopious innovations in their political legislation, have introduced very\nsparing alterations in their civil laws, and that with great difficulty,\nalthough those laws are frequently repugnant to their social condition.\nThe reason of this is, that in matters of civil law the majority is\nobliged to defer to the authority of the legal profession, and that the\nAmerican lawyers are disinclined to innovate when they are left to their\nown choice.\n\nIt is curious for a Frenchman, accustomed to a very different state of\nthings, to hear the perpetual complaints which are made in the United\nStates against the stationary propensities of legal men, and their\nprejudices in favor of existing institutions.\n\nThe influence of the legal habits which are common in America extends\nbeyond the limits I have just pointed out. Scarcely any question arises\nin the United States which does not become, sooner or later, a subject\nof judicial debate; hence all parties are obliged to borrow the ideas,\nand even the language, usual in judicial proceedings in their\ndaily controversies. As most public men are, or have been, legal\npractitioners, they introduce the customs and technicalities of their\nprofession into the affairs of the country. The jury extends this\nhabitude to all classes. The language of the law thus becomes, in some\nmeasure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of the law, which is produced in\nthe schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their\nwalls into the bosom of society, where it descends to the lowest\nclasses, so that the whole people contracts the habits and the tastes of\nthe magistrate. The lawyers of the United States form a party which is\nbut little feared and scarcely perceived, which has no badge peculiar to\nitself, which adapts itself with great flexibility to the exigencies\nof the time, and accommodates itself to all the movements of the social\nbody; but this party extends over the whole community, and it penetrates\ninto all classes of society; it acts upon the country imperceptibly, but\nit finally fashions it to suit its purposes.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVI: Causes Mitigating Tyranny In The United States--Part II\n\nTrial By Jury In The United States Considered As A Political Institution\n\nTrial by jury, which is one of the instruments of the sovereignty of the\npeople, deserves to be compared with the other laws which establish that\nsovereignty--Composition of the jury in the United States--Effect of\ntrial by jury upon the national character--It educates the people--It\ntends to establish the authority of the magistrates and to extend a\nknowledge of law among the people.\n\nSince I have been led by my subject to recur to the administration of\njustice in the United States, I will not pass over this point without\nadverting to the institution of the jury. Trial by jury may be\nconsidered in two separate points of view, as a judicial and as a\npolitical institution. If it entered into my present purpose to inquire\nhow far trial by jury (more especially in civil cases) contributes to\ninsure the best administration of justice, I admit that its utility\nmight be contested. As the jury was first introduced at a time when\nsociety was in an uncivilized state, and when courts of justice were\nmerely called upon to decide on the evidence of facts, it is not an easy\ntask to adapt it to the wants of a highly civilized community when the\nmutual relations of men are multiplied to a surprising extent, and have\nassumed the enlightened and intellectual character of the age. *b\n\n[Footnote b: The investigation of trial by jury as a judicial\ninstitution, and the appreciation of its effects in the United States,\ntogether with the advantages the Americans have derived from it, would\nsuffice to form a book, and a book upon a very useful and curious\nsubject. The State of Louisiana would in particular afford the curious\nphenomenon of a French and English legislation, as well as a French and\nEnglish population, which are gradually combining with each other. See\nthe \"Digeste des Lois de la Louisiane,\" in two volumes; and the \"Traite\nsur les Regles des Actions civiles,\" printed in French and English at\nNew Orleans in 1830.]\n\nMy present object is to consider the jury as a political institution,\nand any other course would divert me from my subject. Of trial by jury,\nconsidered as a judicial institution, I shall here say but very few\nwords. When the English adopted trial by jury they were a semi-barbarous\npeople; they are become, in course of time, one of the most enlightened\nnations of the earth; and their attachment to this institution seems\nto have increased with their increasing cultivation. They soon spread\nbeyond their insular boundaries to every corner of the habitable globe;\nsome have formed colonies, others independent states; the mother-country\nhas maintained its monarchical constitution; many of its offspring have\nfounded powerful republics; but wherever the English have been they have\nboasted of the privilege of trial by jury. *c They have established it,\nor hastened to re-establish it, in all their settlements. A judicial\ninstitution which obtains the suffrages of a great people for so long\na series of ages, which is zealously renewed at every epoch of\ncivilization, in all the climates of the earth and under every form of\nhuman government, cannot be contrary to the spirit of justice. *d\n\n[Footnote c: All the English and American jurists are unanimous upon\nthis head. Mr. Story, judge of the Supreme Court of the United States,\nspeaks, in his \"Treatise on the Federal Constitution,\" of the advantages\nof trial by jury in civil cases:--\"The inestimable privilege of a\ntrial by jury in civil cases--a privilege scarcely inferior to that\nin criminal cases, which is counted by all persons to be essential to\npolitical and civil liberty. . . .\" (Story, book iii., chap. xxxviii.)]\n\n[Footnote d: If it were our province to point out the utility of the\njury as a judicial institution in this place, much might be said, and\nthe following arguments might be brought forward amongst others:--\n\nBy introducing the jury into the business of the courts you are enabled\nto diminish the number of judges, which is a very great advantage. When\njudges are very numerous, death is perpetually thinning the ranks of\nthe judicial functionaries, and laying places vacant for newcomers. The\nambition of the magistrates is therefore continually excited, and they\nare naturally made dependent upon the will of the majority, or the\nindividual who fills up the vacant appointments; the officers of the\ncourt then rise like the officers of an army. This state of things is\nentirely contrary to the sound administration of justice, and to the\nintentions of the legislator. The office of a judge is made inalienable\nin order that he may remain independent: but of what advantage is it\nthat his independence should be protected if he be tempted to sacrifice\nit of his own accord? When judges are very numerous many of them must\nnecessarily be incapable of performing their important duties, for a\ngreat magistrate is a man of no common powers; and I am inclined to\nbelieve that a half-enlightened tribunal is the worst of all instruments\nfor attaining those objects which it is the purpose of courts of justice\nto accomplish. For my own part, I had rather submit the decision of a\ncase to ignorant jurors directed by a skilful judge than to judges a\nmajority of whom are imperfectly acquainted with jurisprudence and with\nthe laws.]\n\nI turn, however, from this part of the subject. To look upon the jury as\na mere judicial institution is to confine our attention to a very narrow\nview of it; for however great its influence may be upon the decisions\nof the law courts, that influence is very subordinate to the powerful\neffects which it produces on the destinies of the community at large.\nThe jury is above all a political institution, and it must be regarded\nin this light in order to be duly appreciated.\n\nBy the jury I mean a certain number of citizens chosen indiscriminately,\nand invested with a temporary right of judging. Trial by jury, as\napplied to the repression of crime, appears to me to introduce an\neminently republican element into the government upon the following\ngrounds:--\n\nThe institution of the jury may be aristocratic or democratic, according\nto the class of society from which the jurors are selected; but it\nalways preserves its republican character, inasmuch as it places the\nreal direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion\nof the governed, instead of leaving it under the authority of the\nGovernment. Force is never more than a transient element of success; and\nafter force comes the notion of right. A government which should only\nbe able to crush its enemies upon a field of battle would very soon be\ndestroyed. The true sanction of political laws is to be found in penal\nlegislation, and if that sanction be wanting the law will sooner or\nlater lose its cogency. He who punishes infractions of the law is\ntherefore the real master of society. Now the institution of the jury\nraises the people itself, or at least a class of citizens, to the bench\nof judicial authority. The institution of the jury consequently invests\nthe people, or that class of citizens, with the direction of society. *e\n\n[Footnote e: An important remark must, however, be made. Trial by jury\ndoes unquestionably invest the people with a general control over the\nactions of citizens, but it does not furnish means of exercising this\ncontrol in all cases, or with an absolute authority. When an absolute\nmonarch has the right of trying offences by his representatives, the\nfate of the prisoner is, as it were, decided beforehand. But even if\nthe people were predisposed to convict, the composition and the\nnon-responsibility of the jury would still afford some chances favorable\nto the protection of innocence.]\n\nIn England the jury is returned from the aristocratic portion of\nthe nation; *f the aristocracy makes the laws, applies the laws, and\npunishes all infractions of the laws; everything is established upon a\nconsistent footing, and England may with truth be said to constitute an\naristocratic republic. In the United States the same system is applied\nto the whole people. Every American citizen is qualified to be an\nelector, a juror, and is eligible to office. *g The system of the jury,\nas it is understood in America, appears to me to be as direct and as\nextreme a consequence of the sovereignty of the people as universal\nsuffrage. These institutions are two instruments of equal power, which\ncontribute to the supremacy of the majority. All the sovereigns who have\nchosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead\nof obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution\nof the jury. The monarchs of the House of Tudor sent to prison jurors\nwho refused to convict, and Napoleon caused them to be returned by his\nagents.\n\n[Footnote f: [This may be true to some extent of special juries, but\nnot of common juries. The author seems not to have been aware that the\nqualifications of jurors in England vary exceedingly.]]\n\n[Footnote g: See Appendix, Q.]\n\nHowever clear most of these truths may seem to be, they do not command\nuniversal assent, and in France, at least, the institution of trial by\njury is still very imperfectly understood. If the question arises as to\nthe proper qualification of jurors, it is confined to a discussion of\nthe intelligence and knowledge of the citizens who may be returned, as\nif the jury was merely a judicial institution. This appears to me to\nbe the least part of the subject. The jury is pre-eminently a political\ninstitution; it must be regarded as one form of the sovereignty of the\npeople; when that sovereignty is repudiated, it must be rejected, or it\nmust be adapted to the laws by which that sovereignty is established.\nThe jury is that portion of the nation to which the execution of the\nlaws is entrusted, as the Houses of Parliament constitute that part\nof the nation which makes the laws; and in order that society may be\ngoverned with consistency and uniformity, the list of citizens qualified\nto serve on juries must increase and diminish with the list of electors.\nThis I hold to be the point of view most worthy of the attention of the\nlegislator, and all that remains is merely accessory.\n\nI am so entirely convinced that the jury is pre-eminently a political\ninstitution that I still consider it in this light when it is applied in\ncivil causes. Laws are always unstable unless they are founded upon the\nmanners of a nation; manners are the only durable and resisting power\nin a people. When the jury is reserved for criminal offences, the people\nonly witnesses its occasional action in certain particular cases; the\nordinary course of life goes on without its interference, and it\nis considered as an instrument, but not as the only instrument, of\nobtaining justice. This is true a fortiori when the jury is only applied\nto certain criminal causes.\n\nWhen, on the contrary, the influence of the jury is extended to civil\ncauses, its application is constantly palpable; it affects all the\ninterests of the community; everyone co-operates in its work: it thus\npenetrates into all the usages of life, it fashions the human mind to\nits peculiar forms, and is gradually associated with the idea of justice\nitself.\n\nThe institution of the jury, if confined to criminal causes, is always\nin danger, but when once it is introduced into civil proceedings it\ndefies the aggressions of time and of man. If it had been as easy to\nremove the jury from the manners as from the laws of England, it would\nhave perished under Henry VIII, and Elizabeth, and the civil jury did in\nreality, at that period, save the liberties of the country. In whatever\nmanner the jury be applied, it cannot fail to exercise a powerful\ninfluence upon the national character; but this influence is\nprodigiously increased when it is introduced into civil causes. The\njury, and more especially the jury in civil cases, serves to communicate\nthe spirit of the judges to the minds of all the citizens; and this\nspirit, with the habits which attend it, is the soundest preparation for\nfree institutions. It imbues all classes with a respect for the thing\njudged, and with the notion of right. If these two elements be removed,\nthe love of independence is reduced to a mere destructive passion. It\nteaches men to practice equity, every man learns to judge his neighbor\nas he would himself be judged; and this is especially true of the jury\nin civil causes, for, whilst the number of persons who have reason to\napprehend a criminal prosecution is small, every one is liable to have\na civil action brought against him. The jury teaches every man not to\nrecoil before the responsibility of his own actions, and impresses him\nwith that manly confidence without which political virtue cannot exist.\nIt invests each citizen with a kind of magistracy, it makes them all\nfeel the duties which they are bound to discharge towards society, and\nthe part which they take in the Government. By obliging men to turn\ntheir attention to affairs which are not exclusively their own, it rubs\noff that individual egotism which is the rust of society.\n\nThe jury contributes most powerfully to form the judgement and to\nincrease the natural intelligence of a people, and this is, in my\nopinion, its greatest advantage. It may be regarded as a gratuitous\npublic school ever open, in which every juror learns to exercise his\nrights, enters into daily communication with the most learned and\nenlightened members of the upper classes, and becomes practically\nacquainted with the laws of his country, which are brought within the\nreach of his capacity by the efforts of the bar, the advice of the\njudge, and even by the passions of the parties. I think that the\npractical intelligence and political good sense of the Americans are\nmainly attributable to the long use which they have made of the jury in\ncivil causes. I do not know whether the jury is useful to those who are\nin litigation; but I am certain it is highly beneficial to those who\ndecide the litigation; and I look upon it as one of the most efficacious\nmeans for the education of the people which society can employ.\n\nWhat I have hitherto said applies to all nations, but the remark I\nam now about to make is peculiar to the Americans and to democratic\npeoples. I have already observed that in democracies the members of the\nlegal profession and the magistrates constitute the only aristocratic\nbody which can check the irregularities of the people. This aristocracy\nis invested with no physical power, but it exercises its conservative\ninfluence upon the minds of men, and the most abundant source of its\nauthority is the institution of the civil jury. In criminal causes, when\nsociety is armed against a single individual, the jury is apt to\nlook upon the judge as the passive instrument of social power, and to\nmistrust his advice. Moreover, criminal causes are entirely founded upon\nthe evidence of facts which common sense can readily appreciate; upon\nthis ground the judge and the jury are equal. Such, however, is not the\ncase in civil causes; then the judge appears as a disinterested arbiter\nbetween the conflicting passions of the parties. The jurors look up to\nhim with confidence and listen to him with respect, for in this instance\ntheir intelligence is completely under the control of his learning. It\nis the judge who sums up the various arguments with which their memory\nhas been wearied out, and who guides them through the devious course of\nthe proceedings; he points their attention to the exact question of\nfact which they are called upon to solve, and he puts the answer to the\nquestion of law into their mouths. His influence upon their verdict is\nalmost unlimited.\n\nIf I am called upon to explain why I am but little moved by the\narguments derived from the ignorance of jurors in civil causes, I reply,\nthat in these proceedings, whenever the question to be solved is not\na mere question of fact, the jury has only the semblance of a judicial\nbody. The jury sanctions the decision of the judge, they by the\nauthority of society which they represent, and he by that of reason and\nof law. *h\n\n[Footnote h: See Appendix, R.]\n\nIn England and in America the judges exercise an influence upon criminal\ntrials which the French judges have never possessed. The reason of\nthis difference may easily be discovered; the English and American\nmagistrates establish their authority in civil causes, and only transfer\nit afterwards to tribunals of another kind, where that authority was\nnot acquired. In some cases (and they are frequently the most important\nones) the American judges have the right of deciding causes alone. *i\nUpon these occasions they are accidentally placed in the position which\nthe French judges habitually occupy, but they are invested with far more\npower than the latter; they are still surrounded by the reminiscence of\nthe jury, and their judgment has almost as much authority as the voice\nof the community at large, represented by that institution. Their\ninfluence extends beyond the limits of the courts; in the recreations of\nprivate life as well as in the turmoil of public business, abroad and in\nthe legislative assemblies, the American judge is constantly surrounded\nby men who are accustomed to regard his intelligence as superior to\ntheir own, and after having exercised his power in the decision\nof causes, he continues to influence the habits of thought and the\ncharacters of the individuals who took a part in his judgment.\n\n\n[Footnote i: The Federal judges decide upon their own authority almost\nall the questions most important to the country.]\n\nThe jury, then, which seems to restrict the rights of magistracy, does\nin reality consolidate its power, and in no country are the judges so\npowerful as there, where the people partakes their privileges. It is\nmore especially by means of the jury in civil causes that the American\nmagistrates imbue all classes of society with the spirit of their\nprofession. Thus the jury, which is the most energetic means of making\nthe people rule, is also the most efficacious means of teaching it to\nrule well.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part I\n\nPrincipal Causes Which Tend To Maintain The Democratic Republic In The\nUnited States\n\nA democratic republic subsists in the United States, and the principal\nobject of this book has been to account for the fact of its existence.\nSeveral of the causes which contribute to maintain the institutions of\nAmerica have been involuntarily passed by or only hinted at as I was\nborne along by my subject. Others I have been unable to discuss, and\nthose on which I have dwelt most are, as it were, buried in the details\nof the former parts of this work. I think, therefore, that before I\nproceed to speak of the future, I cannot do better than collect within\na small compass the reasons which best explain the present. In this\nretrospective chapter I shall be succinct, for I shall take care to\nremind the reader very summarily of what he already knows; and I shall\nonly select the most prominent of those facts which I have not yet\npointed out.\n\nAll the causes which contribute to the maintenance of the democratic\nrepublic in the United States are reducible to three heads:--\n\nI. The peculiar and accidental situation in which Providence has placed\nthe Americans.\n\nII. The laws.\n\nIII. The manners and customs of the people.\n\nAccidental Or Providential Causes Which Contribute To The Maintenance\nOf The Democratic Republic In The United States The Union has no\nneighbors--No metropolis--The Americans have had the chances of birth in\ntheir favor--America an empty country--How this circumstance contributes\npowerfully to the maintenance of the democratic republic in America--How\nthe American wilds are peopled--Avidity of the Anglo-Americans in taking\npossession of the solitudes of the New World--Influence of physical\nprosperity upon the political opinions of the Americans.\n\nA thousand circumstances, independent of the will of man, concur to\nfacilitate the maintenance of a democratic republic in the United\nStates. Some of these peculiarities are known, the others may easily be\npointed out; but I shall confine myself to the most prominent amongst\nthem.\n\nThe Americans have no neighbors, and consequently they have no great\nwars, or financial crises, or inroads, or conquest to dread; they\nrequire neither great taxes, nor great armies, nor great generals; and\nthey have nothing to fear from a scourge which is more formidable to\nrepublics than all these evils combined, namely, military glory. It\nis impossible to deny the inconceivable influence which military\nglory exercises upon the spirit of a nation. General Jackson, whom the\nAmericans have twice elected to the head of their Government, is a man\nof a violent temper and mediocre talents; no one circumstance in the\nwhole course of his career ever proved that he is qualified to govern a\nfree people, and indeed the majority of the enlightened classes of\nthe Union has always been opposed to him. But he was raised to the\nPresidency, and has been maintained in that lofty station, solely by\nthe recollection of a victory which he gained twenty years ago under\nthe walls of New Orleans, a victory which was, however, a very ordinary\nachievement, and which could only be remembered in a country where\nbattles are rare. Now the people which is thus carried away by the\nillusions of glory is unquestionably the most cold and calculating, the\nmost unmilitary (if I may use the expression), and the most prosaic of\nall the peoples of the earth.\n\nAmerica has no great capital *a city, whose influence is directly or\nindirectly felt over the whole extent of the country, which I hold to be\none of the first causes of the maintenance of republican institutions\nin the United States. In cities men cannot be prevented from concerting\ntogether, and from awakening a mutual excitement which prompts\nsudden and passionate resolutions. Cities may be looked upon as large\nassemblies, of which all the inhabitants are members; their populace\nexercises a prodigious influence upon the magistrates, and frequently\nexecutes its own wishes without their intervention.\n\n[Footnote a: The United States have no metropolis, but they already\ncontain several very large cities. Philadelphia reckoned 161,000\ninhabitants and New York 202,000 in the year 1830. The lower orders\nwhich inhabit these cities constitute a rabble even more formidable\nthan the populace of European towns. They consist of freed blacks in the\nfirst place, who are condemned by the laws and by public opinion to\na hereditary state of misery and degradation. They also contain a\nmultitude of Europeans who have been driven to the shores of the New\nWorld by their misfortunes or their misconduct; and these men inoculate\nthe United States with all our vices, without bringing with them any of\nthose interests which counteract their baneful influence. As inhabitants\nof a country where they have no civil rights, they are ready to turn all\nthe passions which agitate the community to their own advantage; thus,\nwithin the last few months serious riots have broken out in Philadelphia\nand in New York. Disturbances of this kind are unknown in the rest of\nthe country, which is nowise alarmed by them, because the population of\nthe cities has hitherto exercised neither power nor influence over the\nrural districts. Nevertheless, I look upon the size of certain American\ncities, and especially on the nature of their population, as a real\ndanger which threatens the future security of the democratic republics\nof the New World; and I venture to predict that they will perish from\nthis circumstance unless the government succeeds in creating an armed\nforce, which, whilst it remains under the control of the majority of the\nnation, will be independent of the town population, and able to repress\nits excesses.\n\n[The population of the city of New York had risen, in 1870, to 942,292,\nand that of Philadelphia to 674,022. Brooklyn, which may be said to form\npart of New York city, has a population of 396,099, in addition to that\nof New York. The frequent disturbances in the great cities of America,\nand the excessive corruption of their local governments--over which\nthere is no effectual control--are amongst the greatest evils and\ndangers of the country.]]\n\nTo subject the provinces to the metropolis is therefore not only\nto place the destiny of the empire in the hands of a portion of the\ncommunity, which may be reprobated as unjust, but to place it in the\nhands of a populace acting under its own impulses, which must be avoided\nas dangerous. The preponderance of capital cities is therefore a serious\nblow upon the representative system, and it exposes modern republics to\nthe same defect as the republics of antiquity, which all perished from\nnot having been acquainted with that form of government.\n\nIt would be easy for me to adduce a great number of secondary causes\nwhich have contributed to establish, and which concur to maintain, the\ndemocratic republic of the United States. But I discern two principal\ncircumstances amongst these favorable elements, which I hasten to point\nout. I have already observed that the origin of the American settlements\nmay be looked upon as the first and most efficacious cause to which the\npresent prosperity of the United States may be attributed. The Americans\nhad the chances of birth in their favor, and their forefathers imported\nthat equality of conditions into the country whence the democratic\nrepublic has very naturally taken its rise. Nor was this all they did;\nfor besides this republican condition of society, the early settler\nbequeathed to their descendants those customs, manners, and opinions\nwhich contribute most to the success of a republican form of government.\nWhen I reflect upon the consequences of this primary circumstance,\nmethinks I see the destiny of America embodied in the first Puritan who\nlanded on those shores, just as the human race was represented by the\nfirst man.\n\nThe chief circumstance which has favored the establishment and the\nmaintenance of a democratic republic in the United States is the nature\nof the territory which the American inhabit. Their ancestors gave them\nthe love of equality and of freedom, but God himself gave them the means\nof remaining equal and free, by placing them upon a boundless continent,\nwhich is open to their exertions. General prosperity is favorable to\nthe stability of all governments, but more particularly of a democratic\nconstitution, which depends upon the dispositions of the majority, and\nmore particularly of that portion of the community which is most exposed\nto feel the pressure of want. When the people rules, it must be rendered\nhappy, or it will overturn the State, and misery is apt to stimulate it\nto those excesses to which ambition rouses kings. The physical causes,\nindependent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity,\nare more numerous in America than they have ever been in any other\ncountry in the world, at any other period of history. In the United\nStates not only is legislation democratic, but nature herself favors the\ncause of the people.\n\nIn what part of human tradition can be found anything at all similar to\nthat which is occurring under our eyes in North America? The celebrated\ncommunities of antiquity were all founded in the midst of hostile\nnations, which they were obliged to subjugate before they could flourish\nin their place. Even the moderns have found, in some parts of South\nAmerica, vast regions inhabited by a people of inferior civilization,\nbut which occupied and cultivated the soil. To found their new states\nit was necessary to extirpate or to subdue a numerous population, until\ncivilization has been made to blush for their success. But North America\nwas only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of the\nnatural riches of the soil, and that vast country was still, properly\nspeaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its inhabitants.\n\nEverything is extraordinary in America, the social condition of\nthe inhabitants, as well as the laws; but the soil upon which these\ninstitutions are founded is more extraordinary than all the rest.\nWhen man was first placed upon the earth by the Creator, the earth was\ninexhaustible in its youth, but man was weak and ignorant; and when he\nhad learned to explore the treasures which it contained, hosts of his\nfellow creatures covered its surface, and he was obliged to earn an\nasylum for repose and for freedom by the sword. At that same period\nNorth America was discovered, as if it had been kept in reserve by the\nDeity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of the deluge.\n\nThat continent still presents, as it did in the primeval time, rivers\nwhich rise from never-failing sources, green and moist solitudes, and\nfields which the ploughshare of the husbandman has never turned. In this\nstate it is offered to man, not in the barbarous and isolated condition\nof the early ages, but to a being who is already in possession of\nthe most potent secrets of the natural world, who is united to his\nfellow-men, and instructed by the experience of fifty centuries. At\nthis very time thirteen millions of civilized Europeans are peaceably\nspreading over those fertile plains, with whose resources and whose\nextent they are not yet themselves accurately acquainted. Three or four\nthousand soldiers drive the wandering races of the aborigines before\nthem; these are followed by the pioneers, who pierce the woods, scare\noff the beasts of prey, explore the courses of the inland streams, and\nmake ready the triumphal procession of civilization across the waste.\n\nThe favorable influence of the temporal prosperity of America upon the\ninstitutions of that country has been so often described by others,\nand adverted to by myself, that I shall not enlarge upon it beyond the\naddition of a few facts. An erroneous notion is generally entertained\nthat the deserts of America are peopled by European emigrants, who\nannually disembark upon the coasts of the New World, whilst the American\npopulation increases and multiplies upon the soil which its forefathers\ntilled. The European settler, however, usually arrives in the United\nStates without friends, and sometimes without resources; in order to\nsubsist he is obliged to work for hire, and he rarely proceeds beyond\nthat belt of industrious population which adjoins the ocean. The desert\ncannot be explored without capital or credit; and the body must be\naccustomed to the rigors of a new climate before it can be exposed to\nthe chances of forest life. It is the Americans themselves who daily\nquit the spots which gave them birth to acquire extensive domains in\na remote country. Thus the European leaves his cottage for the\ntrans-Atlantic shores; and the American, who is born on that very coast,\nplunges in his turn into the wilds of Central America. This double\nemigration is incessant; it begins in the remotest parts of Europe, it\ncrosses the Atlantic Ocean, and it advances over the solitudes of\nthe New World. Millions of men are marching at once towards the same\nhorizon; their language, their religion, their manners differ, their\nobject is the same. The gifts of fortune are promised in the West, and\nto the West they bend their course. *b\n\n[Footnote b: [The number of foreign immigrants into the United States in\nthe last fifty years (from 1820 to 1871) is stated to be 7,556,007. Of\nthese, 4,104,553 spoke English--that is, they came from Great Britain,\nIreland, or the British colonies; 2,643,069 came from Germany or\nnorthern Europe; and about half a million from the south of Europe.]]\n\nNo event can be compared with this continuous removal of the human race,\nexcept perhaps those irruptions which preceded the fall of the Roman\nEmpire. Then, as well as now, generations of men were impelled forwards\nin the same direction to meet and struggle on the same spot; but the\ndesigns of Providence were not the same; then, every newcomer was the\nharbinger of destruction and of death; now, every adventurer brings with\nhim the elements of prosperity and of life. The future still conceals\nfrom us the ulterior consequences of this emigration of the Americans\ntowards the West; but we can readily apprehend its more immediate\nresults. As a portion of the inhabitants annually leave the States in\nwhich they were born, the population of these States increases very\nslowly, although they have long been established: thus in Connecticut,\nwhich only contains fifty-nine inhabitants to the square mile, the\npopulation has not increased by more than one-quarter in forty years,\nwhilst that of England has been augmented by one-third in the lapse of\nthe same period. The European emigrant always lands, therefore, in\na country which is but half full, and where hands are in request:\nhe becomes a workman in easy circumstances; his son goes to seek his\nfortune in unpeopled regions, and he becomes a rich landowner. The\nformer amasses the capital which the latter invests, and the stranger as\nwell as the native is unacquainted with want.\n\nThe laws of the United States are extremely favorable to the division\nof property; but a cause which is more powerful than the laws prevents\nproperty from being divided to excess. *c This is very perceptible in\nthe States which are beginning to be thickly peopled; Massachusetts\nis the most populous part of the Union, but it contains only eighty\ninhabitants to the square mile, which is must less than in France, where\n162 are reckoned to the same extent of country. But in Massachusetts\nestates are very rarely divided; the eldest son takes the land, and the\nothers go to seek their fortune in the desert. The law has abolished\nthe rights of primogeniture, but circumstances have concurred to\nre-establish it under a form of which none can complain, and by which no\njust rights are impaired.\n\n[Footnote c: In New England the estates are exceedingly small, but they\nare rarely subjected to further division.]\n\nA single fact will suffice to show the prodigious number of individuals\nwho leave New England, in this manner, to settle themselves in the\nwilds. We were assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of\nCongress were born in the little State of Connecticut. The population of\nConnecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of\nthe United States, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of\nrepresentatives. The States of Connecticut, however, only sends five\ndelegates to Congress; and the thirty-one others sit for the new Western\nStates. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut,\nit is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners they would\nhave remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity\nwithout being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming\nuseful members of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.\n\nThese reflections do not escape the observation of the Americans any\nmore than of ourselves. \"It cannot be doubted,\" says Chancellor Kent\nin his \"Treatise on American Law,\" \"that the division of landed estates\nmust produce great evils when it is carried to such excess as that\neach parcel of land is insufficient to support a family; but these\ndisadvantages have never been felt in the United States, and many\ngenerations must elapse before they can be felt. The extent of our\ninhabited territory, the abundance of adjacent land, and the continual\nstream of emigration flowing from the shores of the Atlantic towards\nthe interior of the country, suffice as yet, and will long suffice, to\nprevent the parcelling out of estates.\"\n\nIt is difficult to describe the rapacity with which the American rushes\nforward to secure the immense booty which fortune proffers to him.\nIn the pursuit he fearlessly braves the arrow of the Indian and the\ndistempers of the forest; he is unimpressed by the silence of the woods;\nthe approach of beasts of prey does not disturb him; for he is goaded\nonwards by a passion more intense than the love of life. Before him lies\na boundless continent, and he urges onwards as if time pressed, and he\nwas afraid of finding no room for his exertions. I have spoken of the\nemigration from the older States, but how shall I describe that which\ntakes place from the more recent ones? Fifty years have scarcely elapsed\nsince that of Ohio was founded; the greater part of its inhabitants were\nnot born within its confines; its capital has only been built thirty\nyears, and its territory is still covered by an immense extent of\nuncultivated fields; nevertheless the population of Ohio is already\nproceeding westward, and most of the settlers who descend to the fertile\nsavannahs of Illinois are citizens of Ohio. These men left their first\ncountry to improve their condition; they quit their resting-place to\nameliorate it still more; fortune awaits them everywhere, but happiness\nthey cannot attain. The desire of prosperity is become an ardent and\nrestless passion in their minds which grows by what it gains. They early\nbroke the ties which bound them to their natal earth, and they have\ncontracted no fresh ones on their way. Emigration was at first necessary\nto them as a means of subsistence; and it soon becomes a sort of game of\nchance, which they pursue for the emotions it excites as much as for the\ngain it procures.\n\nSometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears\nbehind him. The woods stoop to give him a passage, and spring up again\nwhen he has passed. It is not uncommon in crossing the new States of\nthe West to meet with deserted dwellings in the midst of the wilds; the\ntraveller frequently discovers the vestiges of a log house in the most\nsolitary retreats, which bear witness to the power, and no less to the\ninconstancy of man. In these abandoned fields, and over these ruins of\na day, the primeval forest soon scatters a fresh vegetation, the beasts\nresume the haunts which were once their own, and Nature covers the\ntraces of man's path with branches and with flowers, which obliterate\nhis evanescent track.\n\nI remember that, in crossing one of the woodland districts which still\ncover the State of New York, I reached the shores of a lake embosomed in\nforests coeval with the world. A small island, covered with woods whose\nthick foliage concealed its banks, rose from the centre of the waters.\nUpon the shores of the lake no object attested the presence of man\nexcept a column of smoke which might be seen on the horizon rising from\nthe tops of the trees to the clouds, and seeming to hang from heaven\nrather than to be mounting to the sky. An Indian shallop was hauled\nup on the sand, which tempted me to visit the islet that had first\nattracted my attention, and in a few minutes I set foot upon its banks.\nThe whole island formed one of those delicious solitudes of the New\nWorld which almost lead civilized man to regret the haunts of the\nsavage. A luxuriant vegetation bore witness to the incomparable\nfruitfulness of the soil. The deep silence which is common to the\nwilds of North America was only broken by the hoarse cooing of the\nwood-pigeon, and the tapping of the woodpecker upon the bark of trees.\nI was far from supposing that this spot had ever been inhabited, so\ncompletely did Nature seem to be left to her own caprices; but when I\nreached the centre of the isle I thought that I discovered some traces\nof man. I then proceeded to examine the surrounding objects with care,\nand I soon perceived that a European had undoubtedly been led to seek a\nrefuge in this retreat. Yet what changes had taken place in the scene of\nhis labors! The logs which he had hastily hewn to build himself a\nshed had sprouted afresh; the very props were intertwined with living\nverdure, and his cabin was transformed into a bower. In the midst of\nthese shrubs a few stones were to be seen, blackened with fire and\nsprinkled with thin ashes; here the hearth had no doubt been, and the\nchimney in falling had covered it with rubbish. I stood for some time in\nsilent admiration of the exuberance of Nature and the littleness of man:\nand when I was obliged to leave that enchanting solitude, I exclaimed\nwith melancholy, \"Are ruins, then, already here?\"\n\nIn Europe we are wont to look upon a restless disposition, an unbounded\ndesire of riches, and an excessive love of independence, as propensities\nvery formidable to society. Yet these are the very elements which ensure\na long and peaceful duration to the republics of America. Without these\nunquiet passions the population would collect in certain spots, and\nwould soon be subject to wants like those of the Old World, which it is\ndifficult to satisfy; for such is the present good fortune of the New\nWorld, that the vices of its inhabitants are scarcely less favorable\nto society than their virtues. These circumstances exercise a great\ninfluence on the estimation in which human actions are held in the two\nhemispheres. The Americans frequently term what we should call cupidity\na laudable industry; and they blame as faint-heartedness what we\nconsider to be the virtue of moderate desires.\n\nIn France, simple tastes, orderly manners, domestic affections, and the\nattachments which men feel to the place of their birth, are looked upon\nas great guarantees of the tranquillity and happiness of the State. But\nin America nothing seems to be more prejudicial to society than these\nvirtues. The French Canadians, who have faithfully preserved the\ntraditions of their pristine manners, are already embarrassed for room\nupon their small territory; and this little community, which has so\nrecently begun to exist, will shortly be a prey to the calamities\nincident to old nations. In Canada, the most enlightened, patriotic,\nand humane inhabitants make extraordinary efforts to render the people\ndissatisfied with those simple enjoyments which still content it. There,\nthe seductions of wealth are vaunted with as much zeal as the charms of\nan honest but limited income in the Old World, and more exertions are\nmade to excite the passions of the citizens there than to calm them\nelsewhere. If we listen to their eulogies, we shall hear that nothing is\nmore praiseworthy than to exchange the pure and homely pleasures which\neven the poor man tastes in his own country for the dull delights of\nprosperity under a foreign sky; to leave the patrimonial hearth and\nthe turf beneath which his forefathers sleep; in short, to abandon the\nliving and the dead in quest of fortune.\n\nAt the present time America presents a field for human effort far more\nextensive than any sum of labor which can be applied to work it. In\nAmerica too much knowledge cannot be diffused; for all knowledge, whilst\nit may serve him who possesses it, turns also to the advantage of those\nwho are without it. New wants are not to be feared, since they can be\nsatisfied without difficulty; the growth of human passions need not be\ndreaded, since all passions may find an easy and a legitimate object;\nnor can men be put in possession of too much freedom, since they are\nscarcely ever tempted to misuse their liberties.\n\nThe American republics of the present day are like companies of\nadventurers formed to explore in common the waste lands of the New\nWorld, and busied in a flourishing trade. The passions which agitate\nthe Americans most deeply are not their political but their commercial\npassions; or, to speak more correctly, they introduce the habits they\ncontract in business into their political life. They love order, without\nwhich affairs do not prosper; and they set an especial value upon a\nregular conduct, which is the foundation of a solid business; they\nprefer the good sense which amasses large fortunes to that enterprising\nspirit which frequently dissipates them; general ideas alarm their\nminds, which are accustomed to positive calculations, and they hold\npractice in more honor than theory.\n\nIt is in America that one learns to understand the influence which\nphysical prosperity exercises over political actions, and even over\nopinions which ought to acknowledge no sway but that of reason; and it\nis more especially amongst strangers that this truth is perceptible.\nMost of the European emigrants to the New World carry with them that\nwild love of independence and of change which our calamities are so apt\nto engender. I sometimes met with Europeans in the United States who had\nbeen obliged to leave their own country on account of their political\nopinions. They all astonished me by the language they held, but one of\nthem surprised me more than all the rest. As I was crossing one of the\nmost remote districts of Pennsylvania I was benighted, and obliged\nto beg for hospitality at the gate of a wealthy planter, who was a\nFrenchman by birth. He bade me sit down beside his fire, and we began to\ntalk with that freedom which befits persons who meet in the backwoods,\ntwo thousand leagues from their native country. I was aware that my host\nhad been a great leveller and an ardent demagogue forty years ago, and\nthat his name was not unknown to fame. I was, therefore, not a little\nsurprised to hear him discuss the rights of property as an economist or\na landowner might have done: he spoke of the necessary gradations which\nfortune establishes among men, of obedience to established laws, of\nthe influence of good morals in commonwealths, and of the support which\nreligious opinions give to order and to freedom; he even went to far\nas to quote an evangelical authority in corroboration of one of his\npolitical tenets.\n\nI listened, and marvelled at the feebleness of human reason. A\nproposition is true or false, but no art can prove it to be one or the\nother, in the midst of the uncertainties of science and the conflicting\nlessons of experience, until a new incident disperses the clouds of\ndoubt; I was poor, I become rich, and I am not to expect that prosperity\nwill act upon my conduct, and leave my judgment free; my opinions\nchange with my fortune, and the happy circumstances which I turn to\nmy advantage furnish me with that decisive argument which was before\nwanting. The influence of prosperity acts still more freely upon\nthe American than upon strangers. The American has always seen the\nconnection of public order and public prosperity, intimately united\nas they are, go on before his eyes; he does not conceive that one can\nsubsist without the other; he has therefore nothing to forget; nor\nhas he, like so many Europeans, to unlearn the lessons of his early\neducation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part II\n\nInfluence Of The Laws Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In\nThe United States\n\nThree principal causes of the maintenance of the democratic\nrepublic--Federal Constitutions--Municipal institutions--Judicial power.\n\nThe principal aim of this book has been to make known the laws of the\nUnited States; if this purpose has been accomplished, the reader is\nalready enabled to judge for himself which are the laws that really tend\nto maintain the democratic republic, and which endanger its existence.\nIf I have not succeeded in explaining this in the whole course of my\nwork, I cannot hope to do so within the limits of a single chapter. It\nis not my intention to retrace the path I have already pursued, and\na very few lines will suffice to recapitulate what I have previously\nexplained.\n\n\nThree circumstances seem to me to contribute most powerfully to the\nmaintenance of the democratic republic in the United States.\n\nThe first is that Federal form of Government which the Americans have\nadopted, and which enables the Union to combine the power of a great\nempire with the security of a small State.\n\nThe second consists in those municipal institutions which limit the\ndespotism of the majority, and at the same time impart a taste for\nfreedom and a knowledge of the art of being free to the people.\n\nThe third is to be met with in the constitution of the judicial power.\nI have shown in what manner the courts of justice serve to repress the\nexcesses of democracy, and how they check and direct the impulses of the\nmajority without stopping its activity.\n\n\nInfluence Of Manners Upon The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic In\nThe United States\n\n\nI have previously remarked that the manners of the people may be\nconsidered as one of the general causes to which the maintenance of a\ndemocratic republic in the United States is attributable. I here used\nthe word manners with the meaning which the ancients attached to the\nword mores, for I apply it not only to manners in their proper sense of\nwhat constitutes the character of social intercourse, but I extend it to\nthe various notions and opinions current among men, and to the mass\nof those ideas which constitute their character of mind. I comprise,\ntherefore, under this term the whole moral and intellectual condition of\na people. My intention is not to draw a picture of American manners,\nbut simply to point out such features of them as are favorable to the\nmaintenance of political institutions.\n\nReligion Considered As A Political Institution, Which Powerfully\nContributes To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic Amongst The\nAmericans\n\nNorth America peopled by men who professed a democratic and republican\nChristianity--Arrival of the Catholics--For what reason the Catholics\nform the most democratic and the most republican class at the present\ntime.\n\nEvery religion is to be found in juxtaposition to a political opinion\nwhich is connected with it by affinity. If the human mind be left\nto follow its own bent, it will regulate the temporal and spiritual\ninstitutions of society upon one uniform principle; and man will\nendeavor, if I may use the expression, to harmonize the state in which\nhe lives upon earth with the state which he believes to await him in\nheaven. The greatest part of British America was peopled by men who,\nafter having shaken off the authority of the Pope, acknowledged no other\nreligious supremacy; they brought with them into the New World a form\nof Christianity which I cannot better describe than by styling it a\ndemocratic and republican religion. This sect contributed powerfully to\nthe establishment of a democracy and a republic, and from the earliest\nsettlement of the emigrants politics and religion contracted an alliance\nwhich has never been dissolved.\n\nAbout fifty years ago Ireland began to pour a Catholic population into\nthe United States; on the other hand, the Catholics of America made\nproselytes, and at the present moment more than a million of Christians\nprofessing the truths of the Church of Rome are to be met with in\nthe Union. *d The Catholics are faithful to the observances of their\nreligion; they are fervent and zealous in the support and belief of\ntheir doctrines. Nevertheless they constitute the most republican and\nthe most democratic class of citizens which exists in the United States;\nand although this fact may surprise the observer at first, the causes by\nwhich it is occasioned may easily be discovered upon reflection.\n\n[Footnote d: [It is difficult to ascertain with accuracy the amount of\nthe Roman Catholic population of the United States, but in 1868 an able\nwriter in the \"Edinburgh Review\" (vol. cxxvii. p. 521) affirmed that the\nwhole Catholic population of the United States was then about 4,000,000,\ndivided into 43 dioceses, with 3,795 churches, under the care of 45\nbishops and 2,317 clergymen. But this rapid increase is mainly supported\nby immigration from the Catholic countries of Europe.]]\n\nI think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as\nthe natural enemy of democracy. Amongst the various sects of Christians,\nCatholicism seems to me, on the contrary, to be one of those which are\nmost favorable to the equality of conditions. In the Catholic Church,\nthe religious community is composed of only two elements, the priest and\nthe people. The priest alone rises above the rank of his flock, and all\nbelow him are equal.\n\nOn doctrinal points the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon\nthe same level; it subjects the wise and ignorant, the man of genius and\nthe vulgar crowd, to the details of the same creed; it imposes the same\nobservances upon the rich and needy, it inflicts the same austerities\nupon the strong and the weak, it listens to no compromise with mortal\nman, but, reducing all the human race to the same standard, it confounds\nall the distinctions of society at the foot of the same altar, even as\nthey are confounded in the sight of God. If Catholicism predisposes\nthe faithful to obedience, it certainly does not prepare them for\ninequality; but the contrary may be said of Protestantism, which\ngenerally tends to make men independent, more than to render them equal.\n\nCatholicism is like an absolute monarchy; if the sovereign be removed,\nall the other classes of society are more equal than they are in\nrepublics. It has not unfrequently occurred that the Catholic priest\nhas left the service of the altar to mix with the governing powers of\nsociety, and to take his place amongst the civil gradations of men. This\nreligious influence has sometimes been used to secure the interests\nof that political state of things to which he belonged. At other times\nCatholics have taken the side of aristocracy from a spirit of religion.\n\nBut no sooner is the priesthood entirely separated from the government,\nas is the case in the United States, than is found that no class of men\nare more naturally disposed than the Catholics to transfuse the doctrine\nof the equality of conditions into the political world. If, then, the\nCatholic citizens of the United States are not forcibly led by the\nnature of their tenets to adopt democratic and republican principles,\nat least they are not necessarily opposed to them; and their social\nposition, as well as their limited number, obliges them to adopt these\nopinions. Most of the Catholics are poor, and they have no chance of\ntaking a part in the government unless it be open to all the citizens.\nThey constitute a minority, and all rights must be respected in order\nto insure to them the free exercise of their own privileges. These two\ncauses induce them, unconsciously, to adopt political doctrines,\nwhich they would perhaps support with less zeal if they were rich and\npreponderant.\n\nThe Catholic clergy of the United States has never attempted to oppose\nthis political tendency, but it seeks rather to justify its results. The\npriests in America have divided the intellectual world into two parts:\nin the one they place the doctrines of revealed religion, which command\ntheir assent; in the other they leave those truths which they believe to\nhave been freely left open to the researches of political inquiry.\nThus the Catholics of the United States are at the same time the most\nfaithful believers and the most zealous citizens.\n\nIt may be asserted that in the United States no religious doctrine\ndisplays the slightest hostility to democratic and republican\ninstitutions. The clergy of all the different sects hold the same\nlanguage, their opinions are consonant to the laws, and the human\nintellect flows onwards in one sole current.\n\nI happened to be staying in one of the largest towns in the Union, when\nI was invited to attend a public meeting which had been called for the\npurpose of assisting the Poles, and of sending them supplies of arms and\nmoney. I found two or three thousand persons collected in a vast hall\nwhich had been prepared to receive them. In a short time a priest in\nhis ecclesiastical robes advanced to the front of the hustings: the\nspectators rose, and stood uncovered, whilst he spoke in the following\nterms:--\n\n\"Almighty God! the God of Armies! Thou who didst strengthen the hearts\nand guide the arms of our fathers when they were fighting for the sacred\nrights of national independence; Thou who didst make them triumph over\na hateful oppression, and hast granted to our people the benefits\nof liberty and peace; Turn, O Lord, a favorable eye upon the other\nhemisphere; pitifully look down upon that heroic nation which is even\nnow struggling as we did in the former time, and for the same rights\nwhich we defended with our blood. Thou, who didst create Man in the\nlikeness of the same image, let not tyranny mar Thy work, and establish\ninequality upon the earth. Almighty God! do Thou watch over the destiny\nof the Poles, and render them worthy to be free. May Thy wisdom direct\ntheir councils, and may Thy strength sustain their arms! Shed forth Thy\nterror over their enemies, scatter the powers which take counsel against\nthem; and vouchsafe that the injustice which the world has witnessed for\nfifty years, be not consummated in our time. O Lord, who holdest alike\nthe hearts of nations and of men in Thy powerful hand; raise up allies\nto the sacred cause of right; arouse the French nation from the apathy\nin which its rulers retain it, that it go forth again to fight for the\nliberties of the world.\n\n\"Lord, turn not Thou Thy face from us, and grant that we may always be\nthe most religious as well as the freest people of the earth. Almighty\nGod, hear our supplications this day. Save the Poles, we beseech Thee,\nin the name of Thy well-beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who died\nupon the cross for the salvation of men. Amen.\"\n\nThe whole meeting responded \"Amen!\" with devotion.\n\n\nIndirect Influence Of Religious Opinions Upon Political Society In The\nUnited States\n\n\nChristian morality common to all sects--Influence of religion upon the\nmanners of the Americans--Respect for the marriage tie--In what manner\nreligion confines the imagination of the Americans within certain\nlimits, and checks the passion of innovation--Opinion of the Americans\non the political utility of religion--Their exertions to extend and\nsecure its predominance.\n\nI have just shown what the direct influence of religion upon politics\nis in the United States, but its indirect influence appears to me to be\nstill more considerable, and it never instructs the Americans more fully\nin the art of being free than when it says nothing of freedom.\n\nThe sects which exist in the United States are innumerable. They all\ndiffer in respect to the worship which is due from man to his Creator,\nbut they all agree in respect to the duties which are due from man to\nman. Each sect adores the Deity in its own peculiar manner, but all\nthe sects preach the same moral law in the name of God. If it be of the\nhighest importance to man, as an individual, that his religion should be\ntrue, the case of society is not the same. Society has no future life to\nhope for or to fear; and provided the citizens profess a religion, the\npeculiar tenets of that religion are of very little importance to its\ninterests. Moreover, almost all the sects of the United States are\ncomprised within the great unity of Christianity, and Christian morality\nis everywhere the same.\n\n\nIt may be believed without unfairness that a certain number of Americans\npursue a peculiar form of worship, from habit more than from conviction.\nIn the United States the sovereign authority is religious, and\nconsequently hypocrisy must be common; but there is no country in the\nwhole world in which the Christian religion retains a greater influence\nover the souls of men than in America; and there can be no greater proof\nof its utility, and of its conformity to human nature, than that its\ninfluence is most powerfully felt over the most enlightened and free\nnation of the earth.\n\nI have remarked that the members of the American clergy in general,\nwithout even excepting those who do not admit religious liberty, are\nall in favor of civil freedom; but they do not support any particular\npolitical system. They keep aloof from parties and from public affairs.\nIn the United States religion exercises but little influence upon the\nlaws and upon the details of public opinion, but it directs the manners\nof the community, and by regulating domestic life it regulates the\nState.\n\nI do not question that the great austerity of manners which is\nobservable in the United States, arises, in the first instance, from\nreligious faith. Religion is often unable to restrain man from the\nnumberless temptations of fortune; nor can it check that passion for\ngain which every incident of his life contributes to arouse, but\nits influence over the mind of woman is supreme, and women are the\nprotectors of morals. There is certainly no country in the world\nwhere the tie of marriage is so much respected as in America, or where\nconjugal happiness is more highly or worthily appreciated. In Europe\nalmost all the disturbances of society arise from the irregularities of\ndomestic life. To despise the natural bonds and legitimate pleasures of\nhome, is to contract a taste for excesses, a restlessness of heart, and\nthe evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated by the tumultuous passions\nwhich frequently disturb his dwelling, the European is galled by the\nobedience which the legislative powers of the State exact. But when the\nAmerican retires from the turmoil of public life to the bosom of his\nfamily, he finds in it the image of order and of peace. There his\npleasures are simple and natural, his joys are innocent and calm; and\nas he finds that an orderly life is the surest path to happiness, he\naccustoms himself without difficulty to moderate his opinions as well\nas his tastes. Whilst the European endeavors to forget his domestic\ntroubles by agitating society, the American derives from his own home\nthat love of order which he afterwards carries with him into public\naffairs.\n\nIn the United States the influence of religion is not confined to the\nmanners, but it extends to the intelligence of the people. Amongst\nthe Anglo-Americans, there are some who profess the doctrines of\nChristianity from a sincere belief in them, and others who do the same\nbecause they are afraid to be suspected of unbelief. Christianity,\ntherefore, reigns without any obstacle, by universal consent; the\nconsequence is, as I have before observed, that every principle of the\nmoral world is fixed and determinate, although the political world is\nabandoned to the debates and the experiments of men. Thus the human mind\nis never left to wander across a boundless field; and, whatever may be\nits pretensions, it is checked from time to time by barriers which it\ncannot surmount. Before it can perpetrate innovation, certain primal and\nimmutable principles are laid down, and the boldest conceptions of\nhuman device are subjected to certain forms which retard and stop their\ncompletion.\n\nThe imagination of the Americans, even in its greatest flights, is\ncircumspect and undecided; its impulses are checked, and its works\nunfinished. These habits of restraint recur in political society, and\nare singularly favorable both to the tranquillity of the people and\nto the durability of the institutions it has established. Nature and\ncircumstances concurred to make the inhabitants of the United States\nbold men, as is sufficiently attested by the enterprising spirit with\nwhich they seek for fortune. If the mind of the Americans were free from\nall trammels, they would very shortly become the most daring innovators\nand the most implacable disputants in the world. But the revolutionists\nof America are obliged to profess an ostensible respect for Christian\nmorality and equity, which does not easily permit them to violate the\nlaws that oppose their designs; nor would they find it easy to surmount\nthe scruples of their partisans, even if they were able to get over\ntheir own. Hitherto no one in the United States has dared to advance the\nmaxim, that everything is permissible with a view to the interests of\nsociety; an impious adage which seems to have been invented in an age of\nfreedom to shelter all the tyrants of future ages. Thus whilst the law\npermits the Americans to do what they please, religion prevents them\nfrom conceiving, and forbids them to commit, what is rash or unjust.\n\nReligion in America takes no direct part in the government of society,\nbut it must nevertheless be regarded as the foremost of the political\ninstitutions of that country; for if it does not impart a taste for\nfreedom, it facilitates the use of free institutions. Indeed, it is\nin this same point of view that the inhabitants of the United States\nthemselves look upon religious belief. I do not know whether all the\nAmericans have a sincere faith in their religion, for who can search the\nhuman heart? but I am certain that they hold it to be indispensable to\nthe maintenance of republican institutions. This opinion is not peculiar\nto a class of citizens or to a party, but it belongs to the whole\nnation, and to every rank of society.\n\nIn the United States, if a political character attacks a sect, this may\nnot prevent even the partisans of that very sect from supporting him;\nbut if he attacks all the sects together, everyone abandons him, and he\nremains alone.\n\nWhilst I was in America, a witness, who happened to be called at the\nassizes of the county of Chester (State of New York), declared that he\ndid not believe in the existence of God, or in the immortality of the\nsoul. The judge refused to admit his evidence, on the ground that the\nwitness had destroyed beforehand all the confidence of the Court in\nwhat he was about to say. *e The newspapers related the fact without any\nfurther comment.\n\n[Footnote e: The New York \"Spectator\" of August 23, 1831, relates the\nfact in the following terms:--\"The Court of Common Pleas of Chester\ncounty (New York) a few days since rejected a witness who declared his\ndisbelief in the existence of God. The presiding judge remarked that\nhe had not before been aware that there was a man living who did not\nbelieve in the existence of God; that this belief constituted the\nsanction of all testimony in a court of justice, and that he knew of\nno cause in a Christian country where a witness had been permitted to\ntestify without such belief.\"]\n\nThe Americans combine the notions of Christianity and of liberty so\nintimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive\nthe one without the other; and with them this conviction does not spring\nfrom that barren traditionary faith which seems to vegetate in the soul\nrather than to live.\n\nI have known of societies formed by the Americans to send out ministers\nof the Gospel into the new Western States to found schools and churches\nthere, lest religion should be suffered to die away in those remote\nsettlements, and the rising States be less fitted to enjoy free\ninstitutions than the people from which they emanated. I met with\nwealthy New Englanders who abandoned the country in which they were born\nin order to lay the foundations of Christianity and of freedom on the\nbanks of the Missouri, or in the prairies of Illinois. Thus religious\nzeal is perpetually stimulated in the United States by the duties of\npatriotism. These men do not act from an exclusive consideration of the\npromises of a future life; eternity is only one motive of their devotion\nto the cause; and if you converse with these missionaries of Christian\ncivilization, you will be surprised to find how much value they set upon\nthe goods of this world, and that you meet with a politician where you\nexpected to find a priest. They will tell you that \"all the American\nrepublics are collectively involved with each other; if the republics of\nthe West were to fall into anarchy, or to be mastered by a despot,\nthe republican institutions which now flourish upon the shores of the\nAtlantic Ocean would be in great peril. It is, therefore, our interest\nthat the new States should be religious, in order to maintain our\nliberties.\"\n\nSuch are the opinions of the Americans, and if any hold that the\nreligious spirit which I admire is the very thing most amiss in America,\nand that the only element wanting to the freedom and happiness of the\nhuman race is to believe in some blind cosmogony, or to assert with\nCabanis the secretion of thought by the brain, I can only reply that\nthose who hold this language have never been in America, and that they\nhave never seen a religious or a free nation. When they return from\ntheir expedition, we shall hear what they have to say.\n\nThere are persons in France who look upon republican institutions as a\ntemporary means of power, of wealth, and distinction; men who are the\ncondottieri of liberty, and who fight for their own advantage, whatever\nbe the colors they wear: it is not to these that I address myself. But\nthere are others who look forward to the republican form of government\nas a tranquil and lasting state, towards which modern society is daily\nimpelled by the ideas and manners of the time, and who sincerely desire\nto prepare men to be free. When these men attack religious opinions,\nthey obey the dictates of their passions to the prejudice of their\ninterests. Despotism may govern without faith, but liberty cannot.\nReligion is much more necessary in the republic which they set forth in\nglowing colors than in the monarchy which they attack; and it is more\nneeded in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible\nthat society should escape destruction if the moral tie be not\nstrengthened in proportion as the political tie is relaxed? and what can\nbe done with a people which is its own master, if it be not submissive\nto the Divinity?\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part III\n\n\nPrincipal Causes Which Render Religion Powerful In America Care taken\nby the Americans to separate the Church from the State--The laws, public\nopinion, and even the exertions of the clergy concur to promote\nthis end--Influence of religion upon the mind in the United States\nattributable to this cause--Reason of this--What is the natural state of\nmen with regard to religion at the present time--What are the peculiar\nand incidental causes which prevent men, in certain countries, from\narriving at this state.\n\nThe philosophers of the eighteenth century explained the gradual decay\nof religious faith in a very simple manner. Religious zeal, said they,\nmust necessarily fail, the more generally liberty is established and\nknowledge diffused. Unfortunately, facts are by no means in accordance\nwith their theory. There are certain populations in Europe whose\nunbelief is only equalled by their ignorance and their debasement,\nwhilst in America one of the freest and most enlightened nations in the\nworld fulfils all the outward duties of religious fervor.\n\nUpon my arrival in the United States, the religious aspect of the\ncountry was the first thing that struck my attention; and the longer I\nstayed there the more did I perceive the great political consequences\nresulting from this state of things, to which I was unaccustomed. In\nFrance I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit\nof freedom pursuing courses diametrically opposed to each other; but in\nAmerica I found that they were intimately united, and that they reigned\nin common over the same country. My desire to discover the causes of\nthis phenomenon increased from day to day. In order to satisfy it I\nquestioned the members of all the different sects; and I more especially\nsought the society of the clergy, who are the depositaries of the\ndifferent persuasions, and who are more especially interested in\ntheir duration. As a member of the Roman Catholic Church I was more\nparticularly brought into contact with several of its priests, with\nwhom I became intimately acquainted. To each of these men I expressed my\nastonishment and I explained my doubts; I found that they differed upon\nmatters of detail alone; and that they mainly attributed the peaceful\ndominion of religion in their country to the separation of Church and\nState. I do not hesitate to affirm that during my stay in America I did\nnot meet with a single individual, of the clergy or of the laity, who\nwas not of the same opinion upon this point.\n\nThis led me to examine more attentively than I had hitherto done, the\nstation which the American clergy occupy in political society. I learned\nwith surprise that they filled no public appointments; *f not one of\nthem is to be met with in the administration, and they are not even\nrepresented in the legislative assemblies. In several States *g the law\nexcludes them from political life, public opinion in all. And when I\ncame to inquire into the prevailing spirit of the clergy I found that\nmost of its members seemed to retire of their own accord from the\nexercise of power, and that they made it the pride of their profession\nto abstain from politics.\n\n[Footnote f: Unless this term be applied to the functions which many\nof them fill in the schools. Almost all education is entrusted to the\nclergy.]\n\n[Footnote g: See the Constitution of New York, art. 7, Section 4:-- \"And\nwhereas the ministers of the gospel are, by their profession, dedicated\nto the service of God and the care of souls, and ought not to be\ndiverted from the great duties of their functions: therefore no minister\nof the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any\ntime hereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible\nto, or capable of holding, any civil or military office or place within\nthis State.\"\n\nSee also the constitutions of North Carolina, art. 31; Virginia; South\nCarolina, art. I, Section 23; Kentucky, art. 2, Section 26; Tennessee,\nart. 8, Section I; Louisiana, art. 2, Section 22.]\n\nI heard them inveigh against ambition and deceit, under whatever\npolitical opinions these vices might chance to lurk; but I learned\nfrom their discourses that men are not guilty in the eye of God for any\nopinions concerning political government which they may profess with\nsincerity, any more than they are for their mistakes in building a house\nor in driving a furrow. I perceived that these ministers of the gospel\neschewed all parties with the anxiety attendant upon personal interest.\nThese facts convinced me that what I had been told was true; and it\nthen became my object to investigate their causes, and to inquire how it\nhappened that the real authority of religion was increased by a state\nof things which diminished its apparent force: these causes did not long\nescape my researches.\n\nThe short space of threescore years can never content the imagination\nof man; nor can the imperfect joys of this world satisfy his heart. Man\nalone, of all created beings, displays a natural contempt of existence,\nand yet a boundless desire to exist; he scorns life, but he dreads\nannihilation. These different feelings incessantly urge his soul to\nthe contemplation of a future state, and religion directs his musings\nthither. Religion, then, is simply another form of hope; and it is no\nless natural to the human heart than hope itself. Men cannot abandon\ntheir religious faith without a kind of aberration of intellect, and\na sort of violent distortion of their true natures; but they are\ninvincibly brought back to more pious sentiments; for unbelief is an\naccident, and faith is the only permanent state of mankind. If we only\nconsider religious institutions in a purely human point of view, they\nmay be said to derive an inexhaustible element of strength from man\nhimself, since they belong to one of the constituent principles of human\nnature.\n\nI am aware that at certain times religion may strengthen this influence,\nwhich originates in itself, by the artificial power of the laws, and\nby the support of those temporal institutions which direct society.\nReligions, intimately united to the governments of the earth, have been\nknown to exercise a sovereign authority derived from the twofold source\nof terror and of faith; but when a religion contracts an alliance of\nthis nature, I do not hesitate to affirm that it commits the same error\nas a man who should sacrifice his future to his present welfare; and\nin obtaining a power to which it has no claim, it risks that authority\nwhich is rightfully its own. When a religion founds its empire upon the\ndesire of immortality which lives in every human heart, it may aspire\nto universal dominion; but when it connects itself with a government,\nit must necessarily adopt maxims which are only applicable to certain\nnations. Thus, in forming an alliance with a political power, religion\naugments its authority over a few, and forfeits the hope of reigning\nover all.\n\nAs long as a religion rests upon those sentiments which are the\nconsolation of all affliction, it may attract the affections of mankind.\nBut if it be mixed up with the bitter passions of the world, it may be\nconstrained to defend allies whom its interests, and not the principle\nof love, have given to it; or to repel as antagonists men who are still\nattached to its own spirit, however opposed they may be to the powers\nto which it is allied. The Church cannot share the temporal power of the\nState without being the object of a portion of that animosity which the\nlatter excites.\n\nThe political powers which seem to be most firmly established have\nfrequently no better guarantee for their duration than the opinions of\na generation, the interests of the time, or the life of an individual.\nA law may modify the social condition which seems to be most fixed and\ndeterminate; and with the social condition everything else must change.\nThe powers of society are more or less fugitive, like the years which\nwe spend upon the earth; they succeed each other with rapidity, like the\nfleeting cares of life; and no government has ever yet been founded upon\nan invariable disposition of the human heart, or upon an imperishable\ninterest.\n\nAs long as a religion is sustained by those feelings, propensities,\nand passions which are found to occur under the same forms, at all the\ndifferent periods of history, it may defy the efforts of time; or at\nleast it can only be destroyed by another religion. But when religion\nclings to the interests of the world, it becomes almost as fragile a\nthing as the powers of earth. It is the only one of them all which\ncan hope for immortality; but if it be connected with their ephemeral\nauthority, it shares their fortunes, and may fall with those transient\npassions which supported them for a day. The alliance which religion\ncontracts with political powers must needs be onerous to itself; since\nit does not require their assistance to live, and by giving them its\nassistance to live, and by giving them its assistance it may be exposed\nto decay.\n\nThe danger which I have just pointed out always exists, but it is\nnot always equally visible. In some ages governments seem to be\nimperishable; in others, the existence of society appears to be more\nprecarious than the life of man. Some constitutions plunge the\ncitizens into a lethargic somnolence, and others rouse them to feverish\nexcitement. When governments appear to be so strong, and laws so stable,\nmen do not perceive the dangers which may accrue from a union of Church\nand State. When governments display so much weakness, and laws so much\ninconstancy, the danger is self-evident, but it is no longer possible\nto avoid it; to be effectual, measures must be taken to discover its\napproach.\n\nIn proportion as a nation assumes a democratic condition of society, and\nas communities display democratic propensities, it becomes more and more\ndangerous to connect religion with political institutions; for the\ntime is coming when authority will be bandied from hand to hand, when\npolitical theories will succeed each other, and when men, laws, and\nconstitutions will disappear, or be modified from day to day, and this,\nnot for a season only, but unceasingly. Agitation and mutability are\ninherent in the nature of democratic republics, just as stagnation and\ninertness are the law of absolute monarchies.\n\nIf the Americans, who change the head of the Government once in\nfour years, who elect new legislators every two years, and renew the\nprovincial officers every twelvemonth; if the Americans, who have\nabandoned the political world to the attempts of innovators, had not\nplaced religion beyond their reach, where could it abide in the ebb and\nflow of human opinions? where would that respect which belongs to it\nbe paid, amidst the struggles of faction? and what would become of its\nimmortality, in the midst of perpetual decay? The American clergy were\nthe first to perceive this truth, and to act in conformity with it. They\nsaw that they must renounce their religious influence, if they were to\nstrive for political power; and they chose to give up the support of the\nState, rather than to share its vicissitudes.\n\nIn America, religion is perhaps less powerful than it has been at\ncertain periods in the history of certain peoples; but its influence\nis more lasting. It restricts itself to its own resources, but of those\nnone can deprive it: its circle is limited to certain principles, but\nthose principles are entirely its own, and under its undisputed control.\n\nOn every side in Europe we hear voices complaining of the absence of\nreligious faith, and inquiring the means of restoring to religion some\nremnant of its pristine authority. It seems to me that we must first\nattentively consider what ought to be the natural state of men with\nregard to religion at the present time; and when we know what we have to\nhope and to fear, we may discern the end to which our efforts ought to\nbe directed.\n\nThe two great dangers which threaten the existence of religions are\nschism and indifference. In ages of fervent devotion, men sometimes\nabandon their religion, but they only shake it off in order to adopt\nanother. Their faith changes the objects to which it is directed, but\nit suffers no decline. The old religion then excites enthusiastic\nattachment or bitter enmity in either party; some leave it with anger,\nothers cling to it with increased devotedness, and although persuasions\ndiffer, irreligion is unknown. Such, however, is not the case when a\nreligious belief is secretly undermined by doctrines which may be termed\nnegative, since they deny the truth of one religion without affirming\nthat of any other. Progidious revolutions then take place in the human\nmind, without the apparent co-operation of the passions of man, and\nalmost without his knowledge. Men lose the objects of their fondest\nhopes, as if through forgetfulness. They are carried away by an\nimperceptible current which they have not the courage to stem, but which\nthey follow with regret, since it bears them from a faith they love, to\na scepticism that plunges them into despair.\n\nIn ages which answer to this description, men desert their religious\nopinions from lukewarmness rather than from dislike; they do not reject\nthem, but the sentiments by which they were once fostered disappear. But\nif the unbeliever does not admit religion to be true, he still considers\nit useful. Regarding religious institutions in a human point of view,\nhe acknowledges their influence upon manners and legislation. He admits\nthat they may serve to make men live in peace with one another, and to\nprepare them gently for the hour of death. He regrets the faith which\nhe has lost; and as he is deprived of a treasure which he has learned to\nestimate at its full value, he scruples to take it from those who still\npossess it.\n\nOn the other hand, those who continue to believe are not afraid openly\nto avow their faith. They look upon those who do not share their\npersuasion as more worthy of pity than of opposition; and they are aware\nthat to acquire the esteem of the unbelieving, they are not obliged to\nfollow their example. They are hostile to no one in the world; and as\nthey do not consider the society in which they live as an arena in which\nreligion is bound to face its thousand deadly foes, they love their\ncontemporaries, whilst they condemn their weaknesses and lament their\nerrors.\n\nAs those who do not believe, conceal their incredulity; and as those who\nbelieve, display their faith, public opinion pronounces itself in favor\nof religion: love, support, and honor are bestowed upon it, and it is\nonly by searching the human soul that we can detect the wounds which it\nhas received. The mass of mankind, who are never without the feeling\nof religion, do not perceive anything at variance with the established\nfaith. The instinctive desire of a future life brings the crowd about\nthe altar, and opens the hearts of men to the precepts and consolations\nof religion.\n\nBut this picture is not applicable to us: for there are men amongst us\nwho have ceased to believe in Christianity, without adopting any other\nreligion; others who are in the perplexities of doubt, and who already\naffect not to believe; and others, again, who are afraid to avow that\nChristian faith which they still cherish in secret.\n\nAmidst these lukewarm partisans and ardent antagonists a small number of\nbelievers exist, who are ready to brave all obstacles and to scorn all\ndangers in defence of their faith. They have done violence to human\nweakness, in order to rise superior to public opinion. Excited by the\neffort they have made, they scarcely knew where to stop; and as they\nknow that the first use which the French made of independence was to\nattack religion, they look upon their contemporaries with dread, and\nthey recoil in alarm from the liberty which their fellow-citizens are\nseeking to obtain. As unbelief appears to them to be a novelty, they\ncomprise all that is new in one indiscriminate animosity. They are at\nwar with their age and country, and they look upon every opinion which\nis put forth there as the necessary enemy of the faith.\n\nSuch is not the natural state of men with regard to religion at the\npresent day; and some extraordinary or incidental cause must be at\nwork in France to prevent the human mind from following its original\npropensities and to drive it beyond the limits at which it ought\nnaturally to stop. I am intimately convinced that this extraordinary and\nincidental cause is the close connection of politics and religion.\nThe unbelievers of Europe attack the Christians as their political\nopponents, rather than as their religious adversaries; they hate the\nChristian religion as the opinion of a party, much more than as an\nerror of belief; and they reject the clergy less because they are the\nrepresentatives of the Divinity than because they are the allies of\nauthority.\n\nIn Europe, Christianity has been intimately united to the powers of\nthe earth. Those powers are now in decay, and it is, as it were, buried\nunder their ruins. The living body of religion has been bound down\nto the dead corpse of superannuated polity: cut but the bonds which\nrestrain it, and that which is alive will rise once more. I know not\nwhat could restore the Christian Church of Europe to the energy of its\nearlier days; that power belongs to God alone; but it may be the effect\nof human policy to leave the faith in the full exercise of the strength\nwhich it still retains.\n\n\nHow The Instruction, The Habits, And The Practical Experience Of The\nAmericans Promote The Success Of Their Democratic Institutions\n\n\nWhat is to be understood by the instruction of the American people--The\nhuman mind more superficially instructed in the United States than in\nEurope--No one completely uninstructed--Reason of this--Rapidity with\nwhich opinions are diffused even in the uncultivated States of the\nWest--Practical experience more serviceable to the Americans than\nbook-learning.\n\nI have but little to add to what I have already said concerning the\ninfluence which the instruction and the habits of the Americans exercise\nupon the maintenance of their political institutions.\n\nAmerica has hitherto produced very few writers of distinction; it\npossesses no great historians, and not a single eminent poet. The\ninhabitants of that country look upon what are properly styled literary\npursuits with a kind of disapprobation; and there are towns of very\nsecond-rate importance in Europe in which more literary works are\nannually published than in the twenty-four States of the Union put\ntogether. The spirit of the Americans is averse to general ideas; and it\ndoes not seek theoretical discoveries. Neither politics nor manufactures\ndirect them to these occupations; and although new laws are perpetually\nenacted in the United States, no great writers have hitherto inquired\ninto the general principles of their legislation. The Americans have\nlawyers and commentators, but no jurists; *h and they furnish examples\nrather than lessons to the world. The same observation applies to the\nmechanical arts. In America, the inventions of Europe are adopted with\nsagacity; they are perfected, and adapted with admirable skill to the\nwants of the country. Manufactures exist, but the science of manufacture\nis not cultivated; and they have good workmen, but very few inventors.\nFulton was obliged to proffer his services to foreign nations for a long\ntime before he was able to devote them to his own country.\n\n\n[Footnote h: [This cannot be said with truth of the country of Kent,\nStory, and Wheaton.]]\n\nThe observer who is desirous of forming an opinion on the state of\ninstruction amongst the Anglo-Americans must consider the same object\nfrom two different points of view. If he only singles out the learned,\nhe will be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts the\nignorant, the American people will appear to be the most enlightened\ncommunity in the world. The whole population, as I observed in another\nplace, is situated between these two extremes. In New England, every\ncitizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge; he is\nmoreover taught the doctrines and the evidences of his religion, the\nhistory of his country, and the leading features of its Constitution.\nIn the States of Connecticut and Massachusetts, it is extremely rare to\nfind a man imperfectly acquainted with all these things, and a person\nwholly ignorant of them is a sort of phenomenon.\n\nWhen I compare the Greek and Roman republics with these American States;\nthe manuscript libraries of the former, and their rude population, with\nthe innumerable journals and the enlightened people of the latter; when\nI remember all the attempts which are made to judge the modern republics\nby the assistance of those of antiquity, and to infer what will happen\nin our time from what took place two thousand years ago, I am tempted\nto burn my books, in order to apply none but novel ideas to so novel a\ncondition of society.\n\nWhat I have said of New England must not, however, be applied\nindistinctly to the whole Union; as we advance towards the West or the\nSouth, the instruction of the people diminishes. In the States which are\nadjacent to the Gulf of Mexico, a certain number of individuals may\nbe found, as in our own countries, who are devoid of the rudiments of\ninstruction. But there is not a single district in the United States\nsunk in complete ignorance; and for a very simple reason: the peoples\nof Europe started from the darkness of a barbarous condition, to advance\ntoward the light of civilization; their progress has been unequal;\nsome of them have improved apace, whilst others have loitered in their\ncourse, and some have stopped, and are still sleeping upon the way. *i\n\n[Footnote i: [In the Northern States the number of persons destitute of\ninstruction is inconsiderable, the largest number being 241,152 in\nthe State of New York (according to Spaulding's \"Handbook of American\nStatistics\" for 1874); but in the South no less than 1,516,339 whites\nand 2,671,396 colored persons are returned as \"illiterate.\"]]\n\nSuch has not been the case in the United States. The Anglo-Americans\nsettled in a state of civilization, upon that territory which their\ndescendants occupy; they had not to begin to learn, and it was\nsufficient for them not to forget. Now the children of these same\nAmericans are the persons who, year by year, transport their dwellings\ninto the wilds; and with their dwellings their acquired information and\ntheir esteem for knowledge. Education has taught them the utility of\ninstruction, and has enabled them to transmit that instruction to their\nposterity. In the United States society has no infancy, but it is born\nin man's estate.\n\nThe Americans never use the word \"peasant,\" because they have no idea of\nthe peculiar class which that term denotes; the ignorance of more remote\nages, the simplicity of rural life, and the rusticity of the villager\nhave not been preserved amongst them; and they are alike unacquainted\nwith the virtues, the vices, the coarse habits, and the simple graces\nof an early stage of civilization. At the extreme borders of the\nConfederate States, upon the confines of society and of the wilderness,\na population of bold adventurers have taken up their abode, who pierce\nthe solitudes of the American woods, and seek a country there, in order\nto escape that poverty which awaited them in their native provinces. As\nsoon as the pioneer arrives upon the spot which is to serve him for a\nretreat, he fells a few trees and builds a loghouse. Nothing can offer\na more miserable aspect than these isolated dwellings. The traveller\nwho approaches one of them towards nightfall, sees the flicker of the\nhearth-flame through the chinks in the walls; and at night, if the wind\nrises, he hears the roof of boughs shake to and fro in the midst of\nthe great forest trees. Who would not suppose that this poor hut is the\nasylum of rudeness and ignorance? Yet no sort of comparison can be drawn\nbetween the pioneer and the dwelling which shelters him. Everything\nabout him is primitive and unformed, but he is himself the result of the\nlabor and the experience of eighteen centuries. He wears the dress,\nand he speaks the language of cities; he is acquainted with the past,\ncurious of the future, and ready for argument upon the present; he is,\nin short, a highly civilized being, who consents, for a time, to inhabit\nthe backwoods, and who penetrates into the wilds of the New World with\nthe Bible, an axe, and a file of newspapers.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the incredible rapidity with which public\nopinion circulates in the midst of these deserts. *j I do not think that\nso much intellectual intercourse takes place in the most enlightened\nand populous districts of France. *k It cannot be doubted that, in the\nUnited States, the instruction of the people powerfully contributes to\nthe support of a democratic republic; and such must always be the case,\nI believe, where instruction which awakens the understanding is not\nseparated from moral education which amends the heart. But I by no means\nexaggerate this benefit, and I am still further from thinking, as so\nmany people do think in Europe, that men can be instantaneously made\ncitizens by teaching them to read and write. True information is mainly\nderived from experience; and if the Americans had not been gradually\naccustomed to govern themselves, their book-learning would not assist\nthem much at the present day.\n\n[Footnote j: I travelled along a portion of the frontier of the United\nStates in a sort of cart which was termed the mail. We passed, day and\nnight, with great rapidity along the roads which were scarcely marked\nout, through immense forests; when the gloom of the woods became\nimpenetrable the coachman lighted branches of fir, and we journeyed\nalong by the light they cast. From time to time we came to a hut in\nthe midst of the forest, which was a post-office. The mail dropped an\nenormous bundle of letters at the door of this isolated dwelling, and\nwe pursued our way at full gallop, leaving the inhabitants of the\nneighboring log houses to send for their share of the treasure.\n\n[When the author visited America the locomotive and the railroad were\nscarcely invented, and not yet introduced in the United States. It\nis superfluous to point out the immense effect of those inventions\nin extending civilization and developing the resources of that vast\ncontinent. In 1831 there were 51 miles of railway in the United States;\nin 1872 there were 60,000 miles of railway.]]\n\n[Footnote k: In 1832 each inhabitant of Michigan paid a sum equivalent\nto 1 fr. 22 cent. (French money) to the post-office revenue, and each\ninhabitant of the Floridas paid 1 fr. 5 cent. (See \"National Calendar,\"\n1833, p. 244.) In the same year each inhabitant of the Departement du\nNord paid 1 fr. 4 cent. to the revenue of the French post-office. (See\nthe \"Compte rendu de l'administration des Finances,\" 1833, p. 623.)\nNow the State of Michigan only contained at that time 7 inhabitants\nper square league and Florida only 5: the public instruction and the\ncommercial activity of these districts is inferior to that of most of\nthe States in the Union, whilst the Departement du Nord, which contains\n3,400 inhabitants per square league, is one of the most enlightened and\nmanufacturing parts of France.]\n\nI have lived a great deal with the people in the United States, and I\ncannot express how much I admire their experience and their good sense.\nAn American should never be allowed to speak of Europe; for he will then\nprobably display a vast deal of presumption and very foolish pride. He\nwill take up with those crude and vague notions which are so useful to\nthe ignorant all over the world. But if you question him respecting his\nown country, the cloud which dimmed his intelligence will immediately\ndisperse; his language will become as clear and as precise as his\nthoughts. He will inform you what his rights are, and by what means he\nexercises them; he will be able to point out the customs which obtain in\nthe political world. You will find that he is well acquainted with the\nrules of the administration, and that he is familiar with the mechanism\nof the laws. The citizen of the United States does not acquire his\npractical science and his positive notions from books; the instruction\nhe has acquired may have prepared him for receiving those ideas, but\nit did not furnish them. The American learns to know the laws by\nparticipating in the act of legislation; and he takes a lesson in the\nforms of government from governing. The great work of society is ever\ngoing on beneath his eyes, and, as it were, under his hands.\n\nIn the United States politics are the end and aim of education;\nin Europe its principal object is to fit men for private life. The\ninterference of the citizens in public affairs is too rare an occurrence\nfor it to be anticipated beforehand. Upon casting a glance over society\nin the two hemispheres, these differences are indicated even by its\nexternal aspect.\n\nIn Europe we frequently introduce the ideas and the habits of private\nlife into public affairs; and as we pass at once from the domestic\ncircle to the government of the State, we may frequently be heard to\ndiscuss the great interests of society in the same manner in which we\nconverse with our friends. The Americans, on the other hand, transfuse\nthe habits of public life into their manners in private; and in their\ncountry the jury is introduced into the games of schoolboys, and\nparliamentary forms are observed in the order of a feast.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVII: Principal Causes Maintaining The Democratic Republic--Part IV\n\nThe Laws Contribute More To The Maintenance Of The Democratic Republic\nIn The United States Than The Physical Circumstances Of The Country, And\nThe Manners More Than The Laws\n\nAll the nations of America have a democratic state of society--Yet\ndemocratic institutions only subsist amongst the Anglo-Americans--The\nSpaniards of South America, equally favored by physical causes as the\nAnglo-Americans, unable to maintain a democratic republic--Mexico,\nwhich has adopted the Constitution of the United States, in the same\npredicament--The Anglo-Americans of the West less able to maintain it\nthan those of the East--Reason of these different results.\n\nI have remarked that the maintenance of democratic institutions in the\nUnited States is attributable to the circumstances, the laws, and the\nmanners of that country. *l Most Europeans are only acquainted with\nthe first of these three causes, and they are apt to give it a\npreponderating importance which it does not really possess.\n\n[Footnote l: I remind the reader of the general signification which\nI give to the word \"manners,\" namely, the moral and intellectual\ncharacteristics of social man taken collectively.]\n\nIt is true that the Anglo-Saxons settled in the New World in a state of\nsocial equality; the low-born and the noble were not to be found amongst\nthem; and professional prejudices were always as entirely unknown as the\nprejudices of birth. Thus, as the condition of society was democratic,\nthe empire of democracy was established without difficulty. But this\ncircumstance is by no means peculiar to the United States; almost\nall the trans-Atlantic colonies were founded by men equal amongst\nthemselves, or who became so by inhabiting them. In no one part of\nthe New World have Europeans been able to create an aristocracy.\nNevertheless, democratic institutions prosper nowhere but in the United\nStates.\n\nThe American Union has no enemies to contend with; it stands in the\nwilds like an island in the ocean. But the Spaniards of South America\nwere no less isolated by nature; yet their position has not relieved\nthem from the charge of standing armies. They make war upon each other\nwhen they have no foreign enemies to oppose; and the Anglo-American\ndemocracy is the only one which has hitherto been able to maintain\nitself in peace. *m\n\n[Footnote m: [A remark which, since the great Civil War of 1861-65,\nceases to be applicable.]]\n\nThe territory of the Union presents a boundless field to human activity,\nand inexhaustible materials for industry and labor. The passion of\nwealth takes the place of ambition, and the warmth of faction is\nmitigated by a sense of prosperity. But in what portion of the globe\nshall we meet with more fertile plains, with mightier rivers, or with\nmore unexplored and inexhaustible riches than in South America?\n\nNevertheless, South America has been unable to maintain democratic\ninstitutions. If the welfare of nations depended on their being placed\nin a remote position, with an unbounded space of habitable territory\nbefore them, the Spaniards of South America would have no reason to\ncomplain of their fate. And although they might enjoy less prosperity\nthan the inhabitants of the United States, their lot might still be such\nas to excite the envy of some nations in Europe. There are, however, no\nnations upon the face of the earth more miserable than those of South\nAmerica.\n\nThus, not only are physical causes inadequate to produce results\nanalogous to those which occur in North America, but they are unable\nto raise the population of South America above the level of European\nStates, where they act in a contrary direction. Physical causes do not,\ntherefore, affect the destiny of nations so much as has been supposed.\n\nI have met with men in New England who were on the point of leaving a\ncountry, where they might have remained in easy circumstances, to go to\nseek their fortune in the wilds. Not far from that district I found\na French population in Canada, which was closely crowded on a narrow\nterritory, although the same wilds were at hand; and whilst the emigrant\nfrom the United States purchased an extensive estate with the earnings\nof a short term of labor, the Canadian paid as much for land as he would\nhave done in France. Nature offers the solitudes of the New World to\nEuropeans; but they are not always acquainted with the means of turning\nher gifts to account. Other peoples of America have the same physical\nconditions of prosperity as the Anglo-Americans, but without their laws\nand their manners; and these peoples are wretched. The laws and manners\nof the Anglo-Americans are therefore that efficient cause of their\ngreatness which is the object of my inquiry.\n\nI am far from supposing that the American laws are preeminently good\nin themselves; I do not hold them to be applicable to all democratic\npeoples; and several of them seem to be dangerous, even in the United\nStates. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the American legislation,\ntaken collectively, is extremely well adapted to the genius of the\npeople and the nature of the country which it is intended to govern. The\nAmerican laws are therefore good, and to them must be attributed a large\nportion of the success which attends the government of democracy in\nAmerica: but I do not believe them to be the principal cause of that\nsuccess; and if they seem to me to have more influence upon the social\nhappiness of the Americans than the nature of the country, on the other\nhand there is reason to believe that their effect is still inferior to\nthat produced by the manners of the people.\n\nThe Federal laws undoubtedly constitute the most important part of the\nlegislation of the United States. Mexico, which is not less fortunately\nsituated than the Anglo-American Union, has adopted the same laws, but\nis unable to accustom itself to the government of democracy. Some\nother cause is therefore at work, independently of those physical\ncircumstances and peculiar laws which enable the democracy to rule in\nthe United States.\n\nAnother still more striking proof may be adduced. Almost all the\ninhabitants of the territory of the Union are the descendants of a\ncommon stock; they speak the same language, they worship God in the same\nmanner, they are affected by the same physical causes, and they obey the\nsame laws. Whence, then, do their characteristic differences arise?\nWhy, in the Eastern States of the Union, does the republican government\ndisplay vigor and regularity, and proceed with mature deliberation?\nWhence does it derive the wisdom and the durability which mark its acts,\nwhilst in the Western States, on the contrary, society seems to be ruled\nby the powers of chance? There, public business is conducted with an\nirregularity and a passionate and feverish excitement, which does not\nannounce a long or sure duration.\n\nI am no longer comparing the Anglo-American States to foreign nations;\nbut I am contrasting them with each other, and endeavoring to discover\nwhy they are so unlike. The arguments which are derived from the nature\nof the country and the difference of legislation are here all set aside.\nRecourse must be had to some other cause; and what other cause can there\nbe except the manners of the people?\n\nIt is in the Eastern States that the Anglo-Americans have been longest\naccustomed to the government of democracy, and that they have adopted\nthe habits and conceived the notions most favorable to its maintenance.\nDemocracy has gradually penetrated into their customs, their opinions,\nand the forms of social intercourse; it is to be found in all the\ndetails of daily life equally as in the laws. In the Eastern States\nthe instruction and practical education of the people have been most\nperfected, and religion has been most thoroughly amalgamated with\nliberty. Now these habits, opinions, customs, and convictions are\nprecisely the constituent elements of that which I have denominated\nmanners.\n\nIn the Western States, on the contrary, a portion of the same advantages\nis still wanting. Many of the Americans of the West were born in the\nwoods, and they mix the ideas and the customs of savage life with the\ncivilization of their parents. Their passions are more intense; their\nreligious morality less authoritative; and their convictions less\nsecure. The inhabitants exercise no sort of control over their\nfellow-citizens, for they are scarcely acquainted with each other. The\nnations of the West display, to a certain extent, the inexperience\nand the rude habits of a people in its infancy; for although they are\ncomposed of old elements, their assemblage is of recent date.\n\nThe manners of the Americans of the United States are, then, the real\ncause which renders that people the only one of the American nations\nthat is able to support a democratic government; and it is the influence\nof manners which produces the different degrees of order and of\nprosperity that may be distinguished in the several Anglo-American\ndemocracies. Thus the effect which the geographical position of a\ncountry may have upon the duration of democratic institutions is\nexaggerated in Europe. Too much importance is attributed to legislation,\ntoo little to manners. These three great causes serve, no doubt, to\nregulate and direct the American democracy; but if they were to\nbe classed in their proper order, I should say that the physical\ncircumstances are less efficient than the laws, and the laws very\nsubordinate to the manners of the people. I am convinced that the most\nadvantageous situation and the best possible laws cannot maintain a\nconstitution in spite of the manners of a country; whilst the latter\nmay turn the most unfavorable positions and the worst laws to some\nadvantage. The importance of manners is a common truth to which study\nand experience incessantly direct our attention. It may be regarded as\na central point in the range of human observation, and the common\ntermination of all inquiry. So seriously do I insist upon this head,\nthat if I have hitherto failed in making the reader feel the important\ninfluence which I attribute to the practical experience, the habits,\nthe opinions, in short, to the manners of the Americans, upon the\nmaintenance of their institutions, I have failed in the principal object\nof my work.\n\nWhether Laws And Manners Are Sufficient To Maintain Democratic\nInstitutions In Other Countries Besides America\n\nThe Anglo-Americans, if transported into Europe, would be obliged\nto modify their laws--Distinction to be made between democratic\ninstitutions and American institutions--Democratic laws may be conceived\nbetter than, or at least different from, those which the American\ndemocracy has adopted--The example of America only proves that it\nis possible to regulate democracy by the assistance of manners and\nlegislation.\n\nI have asserted that the success of democratic institutions in the\nUnited States is more intimately connected with the laws themselves, and\nthe manners of the people, than with the nature of the country. But\ndoes it follow that the same causes would of themselves produce the same\nresults, if they were put into operation elsewhere; and if the country\nis no adequate substitute for laws and manners, can laws and manners\nin their turn prove a substitute for the country? It will readily be\nunderstood that the necessary elements of a reply to this question are\nwanting: other peoples are to be found in the New World besides the\nAnglo-Americans, and as these people are affected by the same physical\ncircumstances as the latter, they may fairly be compared together. But\nthere are no nations out of America which have adopted the same laws\nand manners, being destitute of the physical advantages peculiar to the\nAnglo-Americans. No standard of comparison therefore exists, and we can\nonly hazard an opinion upon this subject.\n\nIt appears to me, in the first place, that a careful distinction must\nbe made between the institutions of the United States and democratic\ninstitutions in general. When I reflect upon the state of Europe, its\nmighty nations, its populous cities, its formidable armies, and\nthe complex nature of its politics, I cannot suppose that even the\nAnglo-Americans, if they were transported to our hemisphere, with\ntheir ideas, their religion, and their manners, could exist without\nconsiderably altering their laws. But a democratic nation may be\nimagined, organized differently from the American people. It is not\nimpossible to conceive a government really established upon the will\nof the majority; but in which the majority, repressing its natural\npropensity to equality, should consent, with a view to the order and the\nstability of the State, to invest a family or an individual with all\nthe prerogatives of the executive. A democratic society might exist, in\nwhich the forces of the nation would be more centralized than they are\nin the United States; the people would exercise a less direct and\nless irresistible influence upon public affairs, and yet every citizen\ninvested with certain rights would participate, within his sphere,\nin the conduct of the government. The observations I made amongst the\nAnglo-Americans induce me to believe that democratic institutions of\nthis kind, prudently introduced into society, so as gradually to mix\nwith the habits and to be interfused with the opinions of the people,\nmight subsist in other countries besides America. If the laws of the\nUnited States were the only imaginable democratic laws, or the most\nperfect which it is possible to conceive, I should admit that the\nsuccess of those institutions affords no proof of the success of\ndemocratic institutions in general, in a country less favored by natural\ncircumstances. But as the laws of America appear to me to be defective\nin several respects, and as I can readily imagine others of the same\ngeneral nature, the peculiar advantages of that country do not prove\nthat democratic institutions cannot succeed in a nation less favored by\ncircumstances, if ruled by better laws.\n\nIf human nature were different in America from what it is elsewhere; or\nif the social condition of the Americans engendered habits and opinions\namongst them different from those which originate in the same social\ncondition in the Old World, the American democracies would afford\nno means of predicting what may occur in other democracies. If the\nAmericans displayed the same propensities as all other democratic\nnations, and if their legislators had relied upon the nature of the\ncountry and the favor of circumstances to restrain those propensities\nwithin due limits, the prosperity of the United States would be\nexclusively attributable to physical causes, and it would afford no\nencouragement to a people inclined to imitate their example, without\nsharing their natural advantages. But neither of these suppositions is\nborne out by facts.\n\nIn America the same passions are to be met with as in Europe; some\noriginating in human nature, others in the democratic condition of\nsociety. Thus in the United States I found that restlessness of heart\nwhich is natural to men, when all ranks are nearly equal and the chances\nof elevation are the same to all. I found the democratic feeling of envy\nexpressed under a thousand different forms. I remarked that the people\nfrequently displayed, in the conduct of affairs, a consummate mixture\nof ignorance and presumption; and I inferred that in America, men\nare liable to the same failings and the same absurdities as amongst\nourselves. But upon examining the state of society more attentively,\nI speedily discovered that the Americans had made great and successful\nefforts to counteract these imperfections of human nature, and to\ncorrect the natural defects of democracy. Their divers municipal laws\nappeared to me to be a means of restraining the ambition of the citizens\nwithin a narrow sphere, and of turning those same passions which might\nhave worked havoc in the State, to the good of the township or the\nparish. The American legislators have succeeded to a certain extent in\nopposing the notion of rights to the feelings of envy; the permanence\nof the religious world to the continual shifting of politics; the\nexperience of the people to its theoretical ignorance; and its practical\nknowledge of business to the impatience of its desires.\n\nThe Americans, then, have not relied upon the nature of their country to\ncounterpoise those dangers which originate in their Constitution and\nin their political laws. To evils which are common to all democratic\npeoples they have applied remedies which none but themselves had\never thought of before; and although they were the first to make the\nexperiment, they have succeeded in it.\n\nThe manners and laws of the Americans are not the only ones which may\nsuit a democratic people; but the Americans have shown that it would be\nwrong to despair of regulating democracy by the aid of manners and of\nlaws. If other nations should borrow this general and pregnant idea from\nthe Americans, without however intending to imitate them in the peculiar\napplication which they have made of it; if they should attempt to fit\nthemselves for that social condition, which it seems to be the will of\nProvidence to impose upon the generations of this age, and so to escape\nfrom the despotism or the anarchy which threatens them; what reason is\nthere to suppose that their efforts would not be crowned with success?\nThe organization and the establishment of democracy in Christendom is\nthe great political problem of the time. The Americans, unquestionably,\nhave not resolved this problem, but they furnish useful data to those\nwho undertake the task.\n\nImportance Of What Precedes With Respect To The State Of Europe\n\nIt may readily be discovered with what intention I undertook the\nforegoing inquiries. The question here discussed is interesting not only\nto the United States, but to the whole world; it concerns, not a nation,\nbut all mankind. If those nations whose social condition is democratic\ncould only remain free as long as they are inhabitants of the wilds,\nwe could not but despair of the future destiny of the human race; for\ndemocracy is rapidly acquiring a more extended sway, and the wilds are\ngradually peopled with men. If it were true that laws and manners are\ninsufficient to maintain democratic institutions, what refuge would\nremain open to the nations, except the despotism of a single individual?\nI am aware that there are many worthy persons at the present time who\nare not alarmed at this latter alternative, and who are so tired of\nliberty as to be glad of repose, far from those storms by which it\nis attended. But these individuals are ill acquainted with the\nhaven towards which they are bound. They are so deluded by their\nrecollections, as to judge the tendency of absolute power by what it was\nformerly, and not by what it might become at the present time.\n\nIf absolute power were re-established amongst the democratic nations of\nEurope, I am persuaded that it would assume a new form, and appear under\nfeatures unknown to our forefathers. There was a time in Europe when\nthe laws and the consent of the people had invested princes with almost\nunlimited authority; but they scarcely ever availed themselves of it.\nI do not speak of the prerogatives of the nobility, of the authority of\nsupreme courts of justice, of corporations and their chartered rights,\nor of provincial privileges, which served to break the blows of the\nsovereign authority, and to maintain a spirit of resistance in the\nnation. Independently of these political institutions--which, however\nopposed they might be to personal liberty, served to keep alive the love\nof freedom in the mind of the public, and which may be esteemed to have\nbeen useful in this respect--the manners and opinions of the nation\nconfined the royal authority within barriers which were not less\npowerful, although they were less conspicuous. Religion, the affections\nof the people, the benevolence of the prince, the sense of honor, family\npride, provincial prejudices, custom, and public opinion limited the\npower of kings, and restrained their authority within an invisible\ncircle. The constitution of nations was despotic at that time, but their\nmanners were free. Princes had the right, but they had neither the means\nnor the desire, of doing whatever they pleased.\n\nBut what now remains of those barriers which formerly arrested the\naggressions of tyranny? Since religion has lost its empire over the\nsouls of men, the most prominent boundary which divided good from evil\nis overthrown; the very elements of the moral world are indeterminate;\nthe princes and the peoples of the earth are guided by chance, and none\ncan define the natural limits of despotism and the bounds of license.\nLong revolutions have forever destroyed the respect which surrounded the\nrulers of the State; and since they have been relieved from the burden\nof public esteem, princes may henceforward surrender themselves without\nfear to the seductions of arbitrary power.\n\nWhen kings find that the hearts of their subjects are turned towards\nthem, they are clement, because they are conscious of their strength,\nand they are chary of the affection of their people, because the\naffection of their people is the bulwark of the throne. A mutual\ninterchange of good-will then takes place between the prince and the\npeople, which resembles the gracious intercourse of domestic society.\nThe subjects may murmur at the sovereign's decree, but they are grieved\nto displease him; and the sovereign chastises his subjects with the\nlight hand of parental affection.\n\nBut when once the spell of royalty is broken in the tumult of\nrevolution; when successive monarchs have crossed the throne, so as\nalternately to display to the people the weakness of their right and the\nharshness of their power, the sovereign is no longer regarded by any as\nthe Father of the State, and he is feared by all as its master. If he\nbe weak, he is despised; if he be strong, he is detested. He himself is\nfull of animosity and alarm; he finds that he is as a stranger in his\nown country, and he treats his subjects like conquered enemies.\n\nWhen the provinces and the towns formed so many different nations in the\nmidst of their common country, each of them had a will of its own, which\nwas opposed to the general spirit of subjection; but now that all the\nparts of the same empire, after having lost their immunities, their\ncustoms, their prejudices, their traditions, and their names, are\nsubjected and accustomed to the same laws, it is not more difficult to\noppress them collectively than it was formerly to oppress them singly.\n\nWhilst the nobles enjoyed their power, and indeed long after that power\nwas lost, the honor of aristocracy conferred an extraordinary degree of\nforce upon their personal opposition. They afford instances of men who,\nnotwithstanding their weakness, still entertained a high opinion of\ntheir personal value, and dared to cope single-handed with the efforts\nof the public authority. But at the present day, when all ranks are more\nand more confounded, when the individual disappears in the throng, and\nis easily lost in the midst of a common obscurity, when the honor of\nmonarchy has almost lost its empire without being succeeded by public\nvirtue, and when nothing can enable man to rise above himself, who shall\nsay at what point the exigencies of power and the servility of weakness\nwill stop?\n\nAs long as family feeling was kept alive, the antagonist of oppression\nwas never alone; he looked about him, and found his clients, his\nhereditary friends, and his kinsfolk. If this support was wanting, he\nwas sustained by his ancestors and animated by his posterity. But\nwhen patrimonial estates are divided, and when a few years suffice to\nconfound the distinctions of a race, where can family feeling be found?\nWhat force can there be in the customs of a country which has changed\nand is still perpetually changing, its aspect; in which every act of\ntyranny has a precedent, and every crime an example; in which there\nis nothing so old that its antiquity can save it from destruction, and\nnothing so unparalleled that its novelty can prevent it from being done?\nWhat resistance can be offered by manners of so pliant a make that they\nhave already often yielded? What strength can even public opinion have\nretained, when no twenty persons are connected by a common tie; when\nnot a man, nor a family, nor chartered corporation, nor class, nor free\ninstitution, has the power of representing or exerting that opinion;\nand when every citizen--being equally weak, equally poor, and equally\ndependent--has only his personal impotence to oppose to the organized\nforce of the government?\n\nThe annals of France furnish nothing analogous to the condition in which\nthat country might then be thrown. But it may more aptly be assimilated\nto the times of old, and to those hideous eras of Roman oppression, when\nthe manners of the people were corrupted, their traditions obliterated,\ntheir habits destroyed, their opinions shaken, and freedom, expelled\nfrom the laws, could find no refuge in the land; when nothing protected\nthe citizens, and the citizens no longer protected themselves; when\nhuman nature was the sport of man, and princes wearied out the clemency\nof Heaven before they exhausted the patience of their subjects. Those\nwho hope to revive the monarchy of Henry IV or of Louis XIV, appear\nto me to be afflicted with mental blindness; and when I consider the\npresent condition of several European nations--a condition to which all\nthe others tend--I am led to believe that they will soon be left with\nno other alternative than democratic liberty, or the tyranny of the\nCaesars. *n\n\n[Footnote n: [This prediction of the return of France to imperial\ndespotism, and of the true character of that despotic power, was written\nin 1832, and realized to the letter in 1852.]]\n\nAnd indeed it is deserving of consideration, whether men are to be\nentirely emancipated or entirely enslaved; whether their rights are to\nbe made equal, or wholly taken away from them. If the rulers of society\nwere reduced either gradually to raise the crowd to their own level,\nor to sink the citizens below that of humanity, would not the doubts of\nmany be resolved, the consciences of many be healed, and the community\nprepared to make great sacrifices with little difficulty? In that case,\nthe gradual growth of democratic manners and institutions should be\nregarded, not as the best, but as the only means of preserving freedom;\nand without liking the government of democracy, it might be adopted\nas the most applicable and the fairest remedy for the present ills of\nsociety.\n\nIt is difficult to associate a people in the work of government; but it\nis still more difficult to supply it with experience, and to inspire\nit with the feelings which it requires in order to govern well. I grant\nthat the caprices of democracy are perpetual; its instruments are rude;\nits laws imperfect. But if it were true that soon no just medium would\nexist between the empire of democracy and the dominion of a single arm,\nshould we not rather incline towards the former than submit voluntarily\nto the latter? And if complete equality be our fate, is it not better to\nbe levelled by free institutions than by despotic power?\n\nThose who, after having read this book, should imagine that my\nintention in writing it has been to propose the laws and manners of\nthe Anglo-Americans for the imitation of all democratic peoples, would\ncommit a very great mistake; they must have paid more attention to the\nform than to the substance of my ideas. My aim has been to show, by the\nexample of America, that laws, and especially manners, may exist which\nwill allow a democratic people to remain free. But I am very far from\nthinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy,\nand copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends; for I\nam well aware of the influence which the nature of a country and its\npolitical precedents exercise upon a constitution; and I should regard\nit as a great misfortune for mankind if liberty were to exist all over\nthe world under the same forms.\n\nBut I am of opinion that if we do not succeed in gradually introducing\ndemocratic institutions into France, and if we despair of imparting to\nthe citizens those ideas and sentiments which first prepare them\nfor freedom, and afterwards allow them to enjoy it, there will be no\nindependence at all, either for the middling classes or the nobility,\nfor the poor or for the rich, but an equal tyranny over all; and I\nforesee that if the peaceable empire of the majority be not founded\namongst us in time, we shall sooner or later arrive at the unlimited\nauthority of a single despot.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States--Part I\n\nThe Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Three Races Which\nInhabit The Territory Of The United States\n\nThe principal part of the task which I had imposed upon myself is now\nperformed. I have shown, as far as I was able, the laws and the manners\nof the American democracy. Here I might stop; but the reader would\nperhaps feel that I had not satisfied his expectations.\n\nThe absolute supremacy of democracy is not all that we meet with in\nAmerica; the inhabitants of the New World may be considered from more\nthan one point of view. In the course of this work my subject has often\nled me to speak of the Indians and the Negroes; but I have never been\nable to stop in order to show what place these two races occupy in the\nmidst of the democratic people whom I was engaged in describing. I have\nmentioned in what spirit, and according to what laws, the Anglo-American\nUnion was formed; but I could only glance at the dangers which menace\nthat confederation, whilst it was equally impossible for me to give a\ndetailed account of its chances of duration, independently of its laws\nand manners. When speaking of the united republican States, I hazarded\nno conjectures upon the permanence of republican forms in the New World,\nand when making frequent allusion to the commercial activity which\nreigns in the Union, I was unable to inquire into the future condition\nof the Americans as a commercial people.\n\nThese topics are collaterally connected with my subject without forming\na part of it; they are American without being democratic; and to portray\ndemocracy has been my principal aim. It was therefore necessary to\npostpone these questions, which I now take up as the proper termination\nof my work.\n\nThe territory now occupied or claimed by the American Union spreads from\nthe shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific Ocean. On the east\nand west its limits are those of the continent itself. On the south it\nadvances nearly to the tropic, and it extends upwards to the icy regions\nof the North. The human beings who are scattered over this space do not\nform, as in Europe, so many branches of the same stock. Three races,\nnaturally distinct, and, I might almost say, hostile to each other, are\ndiscoverable amongst them at the first glance. Almost insurmountable\nbarriers had been raised between them by education and by law, as well\nas by their origin and outward characteristics; but fortune has brought\nthem together on the same soil, where, although they are mixed, they do\nnot amalgamate, and each race fulfils its destiny apart.\n\nAmongst these widely differing families of men, the first which attracts\nattention, the superior in intelligence, in power and in enjoyment, is\nthe white or European, the man pre-eminent; and in subordinate grades,\nthe negro and the Indian. These two unhappy races have nothing in\ncommon; neither birth, nor features, nor language, nor habits. Their\nonly resemblance lies in their misfortunes. Both of them occupy an\ninferior rank in the country they inhabit; both suffer from tyranny; and\nif their wrongs are not the same, they originate, at any rate, with the\nsame authors.\n\nIf we reasoned from what passes in the world, we should almost say that\nthe European is to the other races of mankind, what man is to the lower\nanimals;--he makes them subservient to his use; and when he cannot\nsubdue, he destroys them. Oppression has, at one stroke, deprived the\ndescendants of the Africans of almost all the privileges of humanity.\nThe negro of the United States has lost all remembrance of his country;\nthe language which his forefathers spoke is never heard around him; he\nabjured their religion and forgot their customs when he ceased to belong\nto Africa, without acquiring any claim to European privileges. But he\nremains half way between the two communities; sold by the one, repulsed\nby the other; finding not a spot in the universe to call by the name\nof country, except the faint image of a home which the shelter of his\nmaster's roof affords.\n\nThe negro has no family; woman is merely the temporary companion of his\npleasures, and his children are upon an equality with himself from\nthe moment of their birth. Am I to call it a proof of God's mercy or\na visitation of his wrath, that man in certain states appears to be\ninsensible to his extreme wretchedness, and almost affects, with a\ndepraved taste, the cause of his misfortunes? The negro, who is plunged\nin this abyss of evils, scarcely feels his own calamitous situation.\nViolence made him a slave, and the habit of servitude gives him the\nthoughts and desires of a slave; he admires his tyrants more than he\nhates them, and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of\nthose who oppress him: his understanding is degraded to the level of his\nsoul.\n\nThe negro enters upon slavery as soon as he is born: nay, he may have\nbeen purchased in the womb, and have begun his slavery before he began\nhis existence. Equally devoid of wants and of enjoyment, and useless to\nhimself, he learns, with his first notions of existence, that he is the\nproperty of another, who has an interest in preserving his life, and\nthat the care of it does not devolve upon himself; even the power of\nthought appears to him a useless gift of Providence, and he quietly\nenjoys the privileges of his debasement. If he becomes free,\nindependence is often felt by him to be a heavier burden than slavery;\nfor having learned, in the course of his life, to submit to everything\nexcept reason, he is too much unacquainted with her dictates to obey\nthem. A thousand new desires beset him, and he is destitute of the\nknowledge and energy necessary to resist them: these are masters which\nit is necessary to contend with, and he has learnt only to submit and\nobey. In short, he sinks to such a depth of wretchedness, that while\nservitude brutalizes, liberty destroys him.\n\nOppression has been no less fatal to the Indian than to the negro race,\nbut its effects are different. Before the arrival of white men in the\nNew World, the inhabitants of North America lived quietly in their\nwoods, enduring the vicissitudes and practising the virtues and vices\ncommon to savage nations. The Europeans, having dispersed the Indian\ntribes and driven them into the deserts, condemned them to a wandering\nlife full of inexpressible sufferings.\n\nSavage nations are only controlled by opinion and by custom. When the\nNorth American Indians had lost the sentiment of attachment to their\ncountry; when their families were dispersed, their traditions obscured,\nand the chain of their recollections broken; when all their habits were\nchanged, and their wants increased beyond measure, European tyranny\nrendered them more disorderly and less civilized than they were before.\nThe moral and physical condition of these tribes continually grew\nworse, and they became more barbarous as they became more wretched.\nNevertheless, the Europeans have not been able to metamorphose the\ncharacter of the Indians; and though they have had power to destroy\nthem, they have never been able to make them submit to the rules of\ncivilized society.\n\nThe lot of the negro is placed on the extreme limit of servitude, while\nthat of the Indian lies on the uttermost verge of liberty; and slavery\ndoes not produce more fatal effects upon the first, than independence\nupon the second. The negro has lost all property in his own person, and\nhe cannot dispose of his existence without committing a sort of fraud:\nbut the savage is his own master as soon as he is able to act; parental\nauthority is scarcely known to him; he has never bent his will to\nthat of any of his kind, nor learned the difference between voluntary\nobedience and a shameful subjection; and the very name of law is unknown\nto him. To be free, with him, signifies to escape from all the shackles\nof society. As he delights in this barbarous independence, and would\nrather perish than sacrifice the least part of it, civilization has\nlittle power over him.\n\nThe negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself\namongst men who repulse him; he conforms to the tastes of his\noppressors, adopts their opinions, and hopes by imitating them to form a\npart of their community. Having been told from infancy that his race is\nnaturally inferior to that of the whites, he assents to the proposition\nand is ashamed of his own nature. In each of his features he discovers\na trace of slavery, and, if it were in his power, he would willingly rid\nhimself of everything that makes him what he is.\n\nThe Indian, on the contrary, has his imagination inflated with the\npretended nobility of his origin, and lives and dies in the midst of\nthese dreams of pride. Far from desiring to conform his habits to ours,\nhe loves his savage life as the distinguishing mark of his race, and he\nrepels every advance to civilization, less perhaps from the hatred which\nhe entertains for it, than from a dread of resembling the Europeans.\n*a While he has nothing to oppose to our perfection in the arts but\nthe resources of the desert, to our tactics nothing but undisciplined\ncourage; whilst our well-digested plans are met by the spontaneous\ninstincts of savage life, who can wonder if he fails in this unequal\ncontest?\n\n[Footnote a: The native of North America retains his opinions and the\nmost insignificant of his habits with a degree of tenacity which has\nno parallel in history. For more than two hundred years the wandering\ntribes of North America have had daily intercourse with the whites, and\nthey have never derived from them either a custom or an idea. Yet the\nEuropeans have exercised a powerful influence over the savages: they\nhave made them more licentious, but not more European. In the summer of\n1831 I happened to be beyond Lake Michigan, at a place called Green Bay,\nwhich serves as the extreme frontier between the United States and the\nIndians on the north-western side. Here I became acquainted with an\nAmerican officer, Major H., who, after talking to me at length on the\ninflexibility of the Indian character, related the following fact:--\"I\nformerly knew a young Indian,\" said he, \"who had been educated at a\ncollege in New England, where he had greatly distinguished himself, and\nhad acquired the external appearance of a member of civilized society.\nWhen the war broke out between ourselves and the English in 1810, I saw\nthis young man again; he was serving in our army, at the head of the\nwarriors of his tribe, for the Indians were admitted amongst the ranks\nof the Americans, upon condition that they would abstain from their\nhorrible custom of scalping their victims. On the evening of the battle\nof . . ., C. came and sat himself down by the fire of our bivouac. I\nasked him what had been his fortune that day: he related his exploits;\nand growing warm and animated by the recollection of them, he concluded\nby suddenly opening the breast of his coat, saying, 'You must not betray\nme--see here!' And I actually beheld,\" said the Major, \"between his body\nand his shirt, the skin and hair of an English head, still dripping with\ngore.\"]\n\nThe negro, who earnestly desires to mingle his race with that of the\nEuropean, cannot effect if; while the Indian, who might succeed to a\ncertain extent, disdains to make the attempt. The servility of the one\ndooms him to slavery, the pride of the other to death.\n\nI remember that while I was travelling through the forests which still\ncover the State of Alabama, I arrived one day at the log house of a\npioneer. I did not wish to penetrate into the dwelling of the American,\nbut retired to rest myself for a while on the margin of a spring, which\nwas not far off, in the woods. While I was in this place (which was\nin the neighborhood of the Creek territory), an Indian woman appeared,\nfollowed by a negress, and holding by the hand a little white girl of\nfive or six years old, whom I took to be the daughter of the pioneer.\nA sort of barbarous luxury set off the costume of the Indian; rings\nof metal were hanging from her nostrils and ears; her hair, which was\nadorned with glass beads, fell loosely upon her shoulders; and I saw\nthat she was not married, for she still wore that necklace of shells\nwhich the bride always deposits on the nuptial couch. The negress\nwas clad in squalid European garments. They all three came and seated\nthemselves upon the banks of the fountain; and the young Indian, taking\nthe child in her arms, lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers\ngive; while the negress endeavored by various little artifices to\nattract the attention of the young Creole.\n\nThe child displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of\nsuperiority which formed a strange contrast with her infantine weakness;\nas if she received the attentions of her companions with a sort of\ncondescension. The negress was seated on the ground before her mistress,\nwatching her smallest desires, and apparently divided between strong\naffection for the child and servile fear; whilst the savage displayed,\nin the midst of her tenderness, an air of freedom and of pride which was\nalmost ferocious. I had approached the group, and I contemplated them in\nsilence; but my curiosity was probably displeasing to the Indian woman,\nfor she suddenly rose, pushed the child roughly from her, and giving\nme an angry look plunged into the thicket. I had often chanced to see\nindividuals met together in the same place, who belonged to the three\nraces of men which people North America. I had perceived from many\ndifferent results the preponderance of the whites. But in the picture\nwhich I have just been describing there was something peculiarly\ntouching; a bond of affection here united the oppressors with the\noppressed, and the effort of nature to bring them together rendered\nstill more striking the immense distance placed between them by\nprejudice and by law.\n\nThe Present And Probable Future Condition Of The Indian Tribes Which\nInhabit The Territory Possessed By The Union\n\nGradual disappearance of the native tribes--Manner in which it takes\nplace--Miseries accompanying the forced migrations of the Indians--The\nsavages of North America had only two ways of escaping destruction; war\nor civilization--They are no longer able to make war--Reasons why they\nrefused to become civilized when it was in their power, and why they\ncannot become so now that they desire it--Instance of the Creeks and\nCherokees--Policy of the particular States towards these Indians--Policy\nof the Federal Government.\n\nNone of the Indian tribes which formerly inhabited the territory of New\nEngland--the Naragansetts, the Mohicans, the Pecots--have any existence\nbut in the recollection of man. The Lenapes, who received William Penn,\na hundred and fifty years ago, upon the banks of the Delaware, have\ndisappeared; and I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were\nbegging alms. The nations I have mentioned formerly covered the country\nto the sea-coast; but a traveller at the present day must penetrate more\nthan a hundred leagues into the interior of the continent to find an\nIndian. Not only have these wild tribes receded, but they are destroyed;\n*b and as they give way or perish, an immense and increasing people\nfills their place. There is no instance upon record of so prodigious a\ngrowth, or so rapid a destruction: the manner in which the latter change\ntakes place is not difficult to describe.\n\n[Footnote b: In the thirteen original States there are only 6,273\nIndians remaining. (See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117,\np. 90.) [The decrease in now far greater, and is verging on extinction.\nSee page 360 of this volume.]]\n\nWhen the Indians were the sole inhabitants of the wilds from whence they\nhave since been expelled, their wants were few. Their arms were of their\nown manufacture, their only drink was the water of the brook, and their\nclothes consisted of the skins of animals, whose flesh furnished them\nwith food.\n\nThe Europeans introduced amongst the savages of North America fire-arms,\nardent spirits, and iron: they taught them to exchange for manufactured\nstuffs, the rough garments which had previously satisfied their\nuntutored simplicity. Having acquired new tastes, without the arts by\nwhich they could be gratified, the Indians were obliged to have recourse\nto the workmanship of the whites; but in return for their productions\nthe savage had nothing to offer except the rich furs which still\nabounded in his woods. Hence the chase became necessary, not merely to\nprovide for his subsistence, but in order to procure the only objects\nof barter which he could furnish to Europe. *c Whilst the wants of the\nnatives were thus increasing, their resources continued to diminish.\n\n[Footnote c: Messrs. Clarke and Cass, in their Report to Congress on\nFebruary 4, 1829, p. 23, expressed themselves thus:--\"The time when\nthe Indians generally could supply themselves with food and clothing,\nwithout any of the articles of civilized life, has long since passed\naway. The more remote tribes, beyond the Mississippi, who live where\nimmense herds of buffalo are yet to be found and who follow those\nanimals in their periodical migrations, could more easily than any\nothers recur to the habits of their ancestors, and live without the\nwhite man or any of his manufactures. But the buffalo is constantly\nreceding. The smaller animals, the bear, the deer, the beaver, the\notter, the muskrat, etc., principally minister to the comfort and\nsupport of the Indians; and these cannot be taken without guns,\nammunition, and traps. Among the Northwestern Indians particularly, the\nlabor of supplying a family with food is excessive. Day after day is\nspent by the hunter without success, and during this interval his family\nmust subsist upon bark or roots, or perish. Want and misery are around\nthem and among them. Many die every winter from actual starvation.\"\n\nThe Indians will not live as Europeans live, and yet they can neither\nsubsist without them, nor exactly after the fashion of their fathers.\nThis is demonstrated by a fact which I likewise give upon official\nauthority. Some Indians of a tribe on the banks of Lake Superior had\nkilled a European; the American government interdicted all traffic\nwith the tribe to which the guilty parties belonged, until they were\ndelivered up to justice. This measure had the desired effect.]\n\nFrom the moment when a European settlement is formed in the neighborhood\nof the territory occupied by the Indians, the beasts of chase take the\nalarm. *d Thousands of savages, wandering in the forests and destitute\nof any fixed dwelling, did not disturb them; but as soon as the\ncontinuous sounds of European labor are heard in their neighborhood,\nthey begin to flee away, and retire to the West, where their instinct\nteaches them that they will find deserts of immeasurable extent. \"The\nbuffalo is constantly receding,\" say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their\nReport of the year 1829; \"a few years since they approached the base\nof the Alleghany; and a few years hence they may even be rare upon the\nimmense plains which extend to the base of the Rocky Mountains.\" I have\nbeen assured that this effect of the approach of the whites is often\nfelt at two hundred leagues' distance from their frontier. Their\ninfluence is thus exerted over tribes whose name is unknown to them; and\nwho suffer the evils of usurpation long before they are acquainted with\nthe authors of their distress. *e\n\n[Footnote d: \"Five years ago,\" (says Volney in his \"Tableau des\nEtats-Unis,\" p. 370) \"in going from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, a territory\nwhich now forms part of the State of Illinois, but which at the time\nI mention was completely wild (1797), you could not cross a prairie\nwithout seeing herds of from four to five hundred buffaloes. There are\nnow none remaining; they swam across the Mississippi to escape from the\nhunters, and more particularly from the bells of the American cows.\"]\n\n[Footnote e: The truth of what I here advance may be easily proved by\nconsulting the tabular statement of Indian tribes inhabiting the United\nStates and their territories. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress,\nNo. 117, pp. 90-105.) It is there shown that the tribes in the centre\nof America are rapidly decreasing, although the Europeans are still at a\nconsiderable distance from them.]\n\nBold adventurers soon penetrate into the country the Indians have\ndeserted, and when they have advanced about fifteen or twenty\nleagues from the extreme frontiers of the whites, they begin to build\nhabitations for civilized beings in the midst of the wilderness. This\nis done without difficulty, as the territory of a hunting-nation is\nill-defined; it is the common property of the tribe, and belongs to no\none in particular, so that individual interests are not concerned in the\nprotection of any part of it.\n\nA few European families, settled in different situations at a\nconsiderable distance from each other, soon drive away the wild animals\nwhich remain between their places of abode. The Indians, who had\npreviously lived in a sort of abundance, then find it difficult to\nsubsist, and still more difficult to procure the articles of barter\nwhich they stand in need of.\n\nTo drive away their game is to deprive them of the means of existence,\nas effectually as if the fields of our agriculturists were stricken with\nbarrenness; and they are reduced, like famished wolves, to prowl through\nthe forsaken woods in quest of prey. Their instinctive love of their\ncountry attaches them to the soil which gave them birth, *f even after\nit has ceased to yield anything but misery and death. At length they\nare compelled to acquiesce, and to depart: they follow the traces of the\nelk, the buffalo, and the beaver, and are guided by these wild animals\nin the choice of their future country. Properly speaking, therefore, it\nis not the Europeans who drive away the native inhabitants of America;\nit is famine which compels them to recede; a happy distinction which had\nescaped the casuists of former times, and for which we are indebted to\nmodern discovery!\n\n[Footnote f: \"The Indians,\" say Messrs. Clarke and Cass in their Report\nto Congress, p. 15, \"are attached to their country by the same feelings\nwhich bind us to ours; and, besides, there are certain superstitious\nnotions connected with the alienation of what the Great Spirit gave to\ntheir ancestors, which operate strongly upon the tribes who have made\nfew or no cessions, but which are gradually weakened as our intercourse\nwith them is extended. 'We will not sell the spot which contains\nthe bones of our fathers,' is almost always the first answer to a\nproposition for a sale.\"]\n\nIt is impossible to conceive the extent of the sufferings which attend\nthese forced emigrations. They are undertaken by a people already\nexhausted and reduced; and the countries to which the newcomers betake\nthemselves are inhabited by other tribes which receive them with jealous\nhostility. Hunger is in the rear; war awaits them, and misery besets\nthem on all sides. In the hope of escaping from such a host of enemies,\nthey separate, and each individual endeavors to procure the means\nof supporting his existence in solitude and secrecy, living in the\nimmensity of the desert like an outcast in civilized society. The social\ntie, which distress had long since weakened, is then dissolved; they\nhave lost their country, and their people soon desert them: their very\nfamilies are obliterated; the names they bore in common are forgotten,\ntheir language perishes, and all traces of their origin disappear.\nTheir nation has ceased to exist, except in the recollection of the\nantiquaries of America and a few of the learned of Europe.\n\nI should be sorry to have my reader suppose that I am coloring the\npicture too highly; I saw with my own eyes several of the cases of\nmisery which I have been describing; and I was the witness of sufferings\nwhich I have not the power to portray.\n\nAt the end of the year 1831, whilst I was on the left bank of the\nMississippi at a place named by Europeans, Memphis, there arrived a\nnumerous band of Choctaws (or Chactas, as they are called by the\nFrench in Louisiana). These savages had left their country, and were\nendeavoring to gain the right bank of the Mississippi, where they\nhoped to find an asylum which had been promised them by the American\ngovernment. It was then the middle of winter, and the cold was unusually\nsevere; the snow had frozen hard upon the ground, and the river was\ndrifting huge masses of ice. The Indians had their families with them;\nand they brought in their train the wounded and sick, with children\nnewly born, and old men upon the verge of death. They possessed neither\ntents nor wagons, but only their arms and some provisions. I saw them\nembark to pass the mighty river, and never will that solemn spectacle\nfade from my remembrance. No cry, no sob was heard amongst the assembled\ncrowd; all were silent. Their calamities were of ancient date, and they\nknew them to be irremediable. The Indians had all stepped into the bark\nwhich was to carry them across, but their dogs remained upon the bank.\nAs soon as these animals perceived that their masters were finally\nleaving the shore, they set up a dismal howl, and, plunging all together\ninto the icy waters of the Mississippi, they swam after the boat.\n\nThe ejectment of the Indians very often takes place at the present\nday, in a regular, and, as it were, a legal manner. When the European\npopulation begins to approach the limit of the desert inhabited by a\nsavage tribe, the government of the United States usually dispatches\nenvoys to them, who assemble the Indians in a large plain, and having\nfirst eaten and drunk with them, accost them in the following manner:\n\"What have you to do in the land of your fathers? Before long, you must\ndig up their bones in order to live. In what respect is the country you\ninhabit better than another? Are there no woods, marshes, or prairies,\nexcept where you dwell? And can you live nowhere but under your own sun?\nBeyond those mountains which you see at the horizon, beyond the lake\nwhich bounds your territory on the west, there lie vast countries where\nbeasts of chase are found in great abundance; sell your lands to us,\nand go to live happily in those solitudes.\" After holding this language,\nthey spread before the eyes of the Indians firearms, woollen garments,\nkegs of brandy, glass necklaces, bracelets of tinsel, earrings, and\nlooking-glasses. *g If, when they have beheld all these riches, they\nstill hesitate, it is insinuated that they have not the means of\nrefusing their required consent, and that the government itself will not\nlong have the power of protecting them in their rights. What are they to\ndo? Half convinced, and half compelled, they go to inhabit new deserts,\nwhere the importunate whites will not let them remain ten years in\ntranquillity. In this manner do the Americans obtain, at a very low\nprice, whole provinces, which the richest sovereigns of Europe could not\npurchase. *h\n\n[Footnote g: See, in the Legislative Documents of Congress (Doc. 117),\nthe narrative of what takes place on these occasions. This curious\npassage is from the above-mentioned report, made to Congress by Messrs.\nClarke and Cass in February, 1829. Mr. Cass is now the Secretary of War.\n\n\"The Indians,\" says the report, \"reach the treaty-ground poor and almost\nnaked. Large quantities of goods are taken there by the traders, and\nare seen and examined by the Indians. The women and children become\nimportunate to have their wants supplied, and their influence is\nsoon exerted to induce a sale. Their improvidence is habitual and\nunconquerable. The gratification of his immediate wants and desires is\nthe ruling passion of an Indian. The expectation of future advantages\nseldom produces much effect. The experience of the past is lost, and\nthe prospects of the future disregarded. It would be utterly hopeless\nto demand a cession of land, unless the means were at hand of gratifying\ntheir immediate wants; and when their condition and circumstances are\nfairly considered, it ought not to surprise us that they are so anxious\nto relieve themselves.\"]\n\n[Footnote h: On May 19, 1830, Mr. Edward Everett affirmed before the\nHouse of Representatives, that the Americans had already acquired by\ntreaty, to the east and west of the Mississippi, 230,000,000 of acres.\nIn 1808 the Osages gave up 48,000,000 acres for an annual payment of\n$1,000. In 1818 the Quapaws yielded up 29,000,000 acres for $4,000.\nThey reserved for themselves a territory of 1,000,000 acres for a\nhunting-ground. A solemn oath was taken that it should be respected: but\nbefore long it was invaded like the rest. Mr. Bell, in his Report of the\nCommittee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, has these words:--\"To\npay an Indian tribe what their ancient hunting-grounds are worth to\nthem, after the game is fled or destroyed, as a mode of appropriating\nwild lands claimed by Indians, has been found more convenient, and\ncertainly it is more agreeable to the forms of justice, as well as more\nmerciful, than to assert the possession of them by the sword. Thus the\npractice of buying Indian titles is but the substitute which humanity\nand expediency have imposed, in place of the sword, in arriving at the\nactual enjoyment of property claimed by the right of discovery, and\nsanctioned by the natural superiority allowed to the claims of civilized\ncommunities over those of savage tribes. Up to the present time\nso invariable has been the operation of certain causes, first in\ndiminishing the value of forest lands to the Indians, and secondly in\ndisposing them to sell readily, that the plan of buying their right of\noccupancy has never threatened to retard, in any perceptible degree, the\nprosperity of any of the States.\" (Legislative Documents, 21st Congress,\nNo. 227, p. 6.)]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part II\n\nThese are great evils; and it must be added that they appear to me to\nbe irremediable. I believe that the Indian nations of North America are\ndoomed to perish; and that whenever the Europeans shall be established\non the shores of the Pacific Ocean, that race of men will be no more.\n*i The Indians had only the two alternatives of war or civilization;\nin other words, they must either have destroyed the Europeans or become\ntheir equals.\n\n[Footnote i: This seems, indeed, to be the opinion of almost all\nAmerican statesmen. \"Judging of the future by the past,\" says Mr.\nCass, \"we cannot err in anticipating a progressive diminution of their\nnumbers, and their eventual extinction, unless our border should become\nstationary, and they be removed beyond it, or unless some radical change\nshould take place in the principles of our intercourse with them, which\nit is easier to hope for than to expect.\"]\n\nAt the first settlement of the colonies they might have found it\npossible, by uniting their forces, to deliver themselves from the small\nbodies of strangers who landed on their continent. *j They several\ntimes attempted to do it, and were on the point of succeeding; but the\ndisproportion of their resources, at the present day, when compared\nwith those of the whites, is too great to allow such an enterprise to\nbe thought of. Nevertheless, there do arise from time to time among the\nIndians men of penetration, who foresee the final destiny which awaits\nthe native population, and who exert themselves to unite all the tribes\nin common hostility to the Europeans; but their efforts are unavailing.\nThose tribes which are in the neighborhood of the whites, are too much\nweakened to offer an effectual resistance; whilst the others, giving way\nto that childish carelessness of the morrow which characterizes savage\nlife, wait for the near approach of danger before they prepare to meet\nit; some are unable, the others are unwilling, to exert themselves.\n\n[Footnote j: Amongst other warlike enterprises, there was one of the\nWampanaogs, and other confederate tribes, under Metacom in 1675, against\nthe colonists of New England; the English were also engaged in war in\nVirginia in 1622.]\n\nIt is easy to foresee that the Indians will never conform to\ncivilization; or that it will be too late, whenever they may be inclined\nto make the experiment.\n\nCivilization is the result of a long social process which takes place in\nthe same spot, and is handed down from one generation to another, each\none profiting by the experience of the last. Of all nations, those\nsubmit to civilization with the most difficulty which habitually live by\nthe chase. Pastoral tribes, indeed, often change their place of abode;\nbut they follow a regular order in their migrations, and often return\nagain to their old stations, whilst the dwelling of the hunter varies\nwith that of the animals he pursues.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to diffuse knowledge amongst the\nIndians, without controlling their wandering propensities; by the\nJesuits in Canada, and by the Puritans in New England; *k but none of\nthese endeavors were crowned by any lasting success. Civilization began\nin the cabin, but it soon retired to expire in the woods. The great\nerror of these legislators of the Indians was their not understanding\nthat, in order to succeed in civilizing a people, it is first necessary\nto fix it; which cannot be done without inducing it to cultivate the\nsoil; the Indians ought in the first place to have been accustomed\nto agriculture. But not only are they destitute of this indispensable\npreliminary to civilization, they would even have great difficulty in\nacquiring it. Men who have once abandoned themselves to the restless and\nadventurous life of the hunter, feel an insurmountable disgust for the\nconstant and regular labor which tillage requires. We see this proved in\nthe bosom of our own society; but it is far more visible among peoples\nwhose partiality for the chase is a part of their national character.\n\n[Footnote k: See the \"Histoire de la Nouvelle France,\" by Charlevoix,\nand the work entitled \"Lettres edifiantes.\"]\n\nIndependently of this general difficulty, there is another, which\napplies peculiarly to the Indians; they consider labor not merely as an\nevil, but as a disgrace; so that their pride prevents them from becoming\ncivilized, as much as their indolence. *l\n\n[Footnote l: \"In all the tribes,\" says Volney, in his \"Tableau des\nEtats-Unis,\" p. 423, \"there still exists a generation of old warriors,\nwho cannot forbear, when they see their countrymen using the hoe, from\nexclaiming against the degradation of ancient manners, and asserting\nthat the savages owe their decline to these innovations; adding, that\nthey have only to return to their primitive habits in order to recover\ntheir power and their glory.\"]\n\nThere is no Indian so wretched as not to retain under his hut of bark a\nlofty idea of his personal worth; he considers the cares of industry\nand labor as degrading occupations; he compares the husbandman to the ox\nwhich traces the furrow; and even in our most ingenious handicraft,\nhe can see nothing but the labor of slaves. Not that he is devoid of\nadmiration for the power and intellectual greatness of the whites; but\nalthough the result of our efforts surprises him, he contemns the means\nby which we obtain it; and while he acknowledges our ascendancy, he\nstill believes in his superiority. War and hunting are the only pursuits\nwhich appear to him worthy to be the occupations of a man. *m The\nIndian, in the dreary solitude of his woods, cherishes the same ideas,\nthe same opinions as the noble of the Middle ages in his castle, and he\nonly requires to become a conqueror to complete the resemblance; thus,\nhowever strange it may seem, it is in the forests of the New World,\nand not amongst the Europeans who people its coasts, that the ancient\nprejudices of Europe are still in existence.\n\n\n[Footnote m: The following description occurs in an official document:\n\"Until a young man has been engaged with an enemy, and has performed\nsome acts of valor, he gains no consideration, but is regarded nearly as\na woman. In their great war-dances all the warriors in succession\nstrike the post, as it is called, and recount their exploits. On these\noccasions their auditory consists of the kinsmen, friends, and comrades\nof the narrator. The profound impression which his discourse produces on\nthem is manifested by the silent attention it receives, and by the loud\nshouts which hail its termination. The young man who finds himself\nat such a meeting without anything to recount is very unhappy; and\ninstances have sometimes occurred of young warriors, whose passions had\nbeen thus inflamed, quitting the war-dance suddenly, and going off alone\nto seek for trophies which they might exhibit, and adventures which they\nmight be allowed to relate.\"]\n\nMore than once, in the course of this work, I have endeavored to explain\nthe prodigious influence which the social condition appears to exercise\nupon the laws and the manners of men; and I beg to add a few words on\nthe same subject.\n\nWhen I perceive the resemblance which exists between the political\ninstitutions of our ancestors, the Germans, and of the wandering tribes\nof North America; between the customs described by Tacitus, and those of\nwhich I have sometimes been a witness, I cannot help thinking that the\nsame cause has brought about the same results in both hemispheres; and\nthat in the midst of the apparent diversity of human affairs, a certain\nnumber of primary facts may be discovered, from which all the others\nare derived. In what we usually call the German institutions, then, I am\ninclined only to perceive barbarian habits; and the opinions of savages\nin what we style feudal principles.\n\nHowever strongly the vices and prejudices of the North American Indians\nmay be opposed to their becoming agricultural and civilized, necessity\nsometimes obliges them to it. Several of the Southern nations, and\namongst others the Cherokees and the Creeks, *n were surrounded by\nEuropeans, who had landed on the shores of the Atlantic; and who,\neither descending the Ohio or proceeding up the Mississippi, arrived\nsimultaneously upon their borders. These tribes have not been driven\nfrom place to place, like their Northern brethren; but they have been\ngradually enclosed within narrow limits, like the game within the\nthicket, before the huntsmen plunge into the interior. The Indians\nwho were thus placed between civilization and death, found themselves\nobliged to live by ignominious labor like the whites. They took to\nagriculture, and without entirely forsaking their old habits or manners,\nsacrificed only as much as was necessary to their existence.\n\n[Footnote n: These nations are now swallowed up in the States of\nGeorgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. There were formerly in the\nSouth four great nations (remnants of which still exist), the Choctaws,\nthe Chickasaws, the Creeks, and the Cherokees. The remnants of these\nfour nations amounted, in 1830, to about 75,000 individuals. It is\ncomputed that there are now remaining in the territory occupied\nor claimed by the Anglo-American Union about 300,000 Indians. (See\nProceedings of the Indian Board in the City of New York.) The official\ndocuments supplied to Congress make the number amount to 313,130. The\nreader who is curious to know the names and numerical strength of all\nthe tribes which inhabit the Anglo-American territory should consult the\ndocuments I refer to. (Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No.\n117, pp. 90-105.) [In the Census of 1870 it is stated that the Indian\npopulation of the United States is only 25,731, of whom 7,241 are in\nCalifornia.]]\n\nThe Cherokees went further; they created a written language; established\na permanent form of government; and as everything proceeds rapidly\nin the New World, before they had all of them clothes, they set up a\nnewspaper. *o\n\n[Footnote o: I brought back with me to France one or two copies of this\nsingular publication.]\n\nThe growth of European habits has been remarkably accelerated among\nthese Indians by the mixed race which has sprung up. *p Deriving\nintelligence from their father's side, without entirely losing the\nsavage customs of the mother, the half-blood forms the natural link\nbetween civilization and barbarism. Wherever this race has multiplied\nthe savage state has become modified, and a great change has taken place\nin the manners of the people. *q\n\n[Footnote p: See in the Report of the Committee on Indian Affairs, 21st\nCongress, No. 227, p. 23, the reasons for the multiplication of Indians\nof mixed blood among the Cherokees. The principal cause dates from the\nWar of Independence. Many Anglo-Americans of Georgia, having taken the\nside of England, were obliged to retreat among the Indians, where they\nmarried.]\n\n[Footnote q: Unhappily the mixed race has been less numerous and less\ninfluential in North America than in any other country. The American\ncontinent was peopled by two great nations of Europe, the French and\nthe English. The former were not slow in connecting themselves with the\ndaughters of the natives, but there was an unfortunate affinity between\nthe Indian character and their own: instead of giving the tastes and\nhabits of civilized life to the savages, the French too often grew\npassionately fond of the state of wild freedom they found them in. They\nbecame the most dangerous of the inhabitants of the desert, and won the\nfriendship of the Indian by exaggerating his vices and his virtues. M.\nde Senonville, the governor of Canada, wrote thus to Louis XIV in 1685:\n\"It has long been believed that in order to civilize the savages we\nought to draw them nearer to us. But there is every reason to suppose we\nhave been mistaken. Those which have been brought into contact with us\nhave not become French, and the French who have lived among them are\nchanged into savages, affecting to dress and live like them.\" (\"History\nof New France,\" by Charlevoix, vol. ii., p. 345.) The Englishman, on the\ncontrary, continuing obstinately attached to the customs and the most\ninsignificant habits of his forefathers, has remained in the midst of\nthe American solitudes just what he was in the bosom of European cities;\nhe would not allow of any communication with savages whom he despised,\nand avoided with care the union of his race with theirs. Thus while the\nFrench exercised no salutary influence over the Indians, the English\nhave always remained alien from them.]\n\nThe success of the Cherokees proves that the Indians are capable of\ncivilization, but it does not prove that they will succeed in it. This\ndifficulty which the Indians find in submitting to civilization proceeds\nfrom the influence of a general cause, which it is almost impossible\nfor them to escape. An attentive survey of history demonstrates that,\nin general, barbarous nations have raised themselves to civilization by\ndegrees, and by their own efforts. Whenever they derive knowledge from a\nforeign people, they stood towards it in the relation of conquerors, and\nnot of a conquered nation. When the conquered nation is enlightened, and\nthe conquerors are half savage, as in the case of the invasion of Rome\nby the Northern nations or that of China by the Mongols, the power\nwhich victory bestows upon the barbarian is sufficient to keep up his\nimportance among civilized men, and permit him to rank as their equal,\nuntil he becomes their rival: the one has might on his side, the other\nhas intelligence; the former admires the knowledge and the arts of the\nconquered, the latter envies the power of the conquerors. The barbarians\nat length admit civilized man into their palaces, and he in turn opens\nhis schools to the barbarians. But when the side on which the physical\nforce lies, also possesses an intellectual preponderance, the conquered\nparty seldom become civilized; it retreats, or is destroyed. It may\ntherefore be said, in a general way, that savages go forth in arms to\nseek knowledge, but that they do not receive it when it comes to them.\n\nIf the Indian tribes which now inhabit the heart of the continent could\nsummon up energy enough to attempt to civilize themselves, they might\npossibly succeed. Superior already to the barbarous nations which\nsurround them, they would gradually gain strength and experience, and\nwhen the Europeans should appear upon their borders, they would be in a\nstate, if not to maintain their independence, at least to assert their\nright to the soil, and to incorporate themselves with the conquerors.\nBut it is the misfortune of Indians to be brought into contact with a\ncivilized people, which is also (it must be owned) the most avaricious\nnation on the globe, whilst they are still semi-barbarian: to find\ndespots in their instructors, and to receive knowledge from the hand\nof oppression. Living in the freedom of the woods, the North American\nIndian was destitute, but he had no feeling of inferiority towards\nanyone; as soon, however, as he desires to penetrate into the social\nscale of the whites, he takes the lowest rank in society, for he enters,\nignorant and poor, within the pale of science and wealth. After having\nled a life of agitation, beset with evils and dangers, but at the\nsame time filled with proud emotions, *r he is obliged to submit to\na wearisome, obscure, and degraded state; and to gain the bread which\nnourishes him by hard and ignoble labor; such are in his eyes the only\nresults of which civilization can boast: and even this much he is not\nsure to obtain.\n\n[Footnote r: There is in the adventurous life of the hunter a certain\nirresistible charm, which seizes the heart of man and carries him away\nin spite of reason and experience. This is plainly shown by the memoirs\nof Tanner. Tanner is a European who was carried away at the age of six\nby the Indians, and has remained thirty years with them in the woods.\nNothing can be conceived more appalling that the miseries which he\ndescribes. He tells us of tribes without a chief, families without\na nation to call their own, men in a state of isolation, wrecks of\npowerful tribes wandering at random amid the ice and snow and desolate\nsolitudes of Canada. Hunger and cold pursue them; every day their life\nis in jeopardy. Amongst these men, manners have lost their empire,\ntraditions are without power. They become more and more savage. Tanner\nshared in all these miseries; he was aware of his European origin; he\nwas not kept away from the whites by force; on the contrary, he came\nevery year to trade with them, entered their dwellings, and witnessed\ntheir enjoyments; he knew that whenever he chose to return to civilized\nlife he was perfectly able to do so--and he remained thirty years in the\ndeserts. When he came into civilized society he declared that the rude\nexistence which he described, had a secret charm for him which he\nwas unable to define: he returned to it again and again: at length he\nabandoned it with poignant regret; and when he was at length fixed among\nthe whites, several of his children refused to share his tranquil and\neasy situation. I saw Tanner myself at the lower end of Lake Superior;\nhe seemed to me to be more like a savage than a civilized being. His\nbook is written without either taste or order; but he gives, even\nunconsciously, a lively picture of the prejudices, the passions, the\nvices, and, above all, of the destitution in which he lived.]\n\nWhen the Indians undertake to imitate their European neighbors, and to\ntill the earth like the settlers, they are immediately exposed to a\nvery formidable competition. The white man is skilled in the craft of\nagriculture; the Indian is a rough beginner in an art with which he is\nunacquainted. The former reaps abundant crops without difficulty, the\nlatter meets with a thousand obstacles in raising the fruits of the\nearth.\n\nThe European is placed amongst a population whose wants he knows and\npartakes. The savage is isolated in the midst of a hostile people, with\nwhose manners, language, and laws he is imperfectly acquainted, but\nwithout whose assistance he cannot live. He can only procure the\nmaterials of comfort by bartering his commodities against the goods\nof the European, for the assistance of his countrymen is wholly\ninsufficient to supply his wants. When the Indian wishes to sell the\nproduce of his labor, he cannot always meet with a purchaser, whilst the\nEuropean readily finds a market; and the former can only produce at a\nconsiderable cost that which the latter vends at a very low rate. Thus\nthe Indian has no sooner escaped those evils to which barbarous nations\nare exposed, than he is subjected to the still greater miseries of\ncivilized communities; and he finds is scarcely less difficult to live\nin the midst of our abundance, than in the depth of his own wilderness.\n\nHe has not yet lost the habits of his erratic life; the traditions of\nhis fathers and his passion for the chase are still alive within him.\nThe wild enjoyments which formerly animated him in the woods, painfully\nexcite his troubled imagination; and his former privations appear to\nbe less keen, his former perils less appalling. He contrasts the\nindependence which he possessed amongst his equals with the servile\nposition which he occupies in civilized society. On the other hand,\nthe solitudes which were so long his free home are still at hand; a few\nhours' march will bring him back to them once more. The whites offer him\na sum, which seems to him to be considerable, for the ground which he\nhas begun to clear. This money of the Europeans may possibly furnish him\nwith the means of a happy and peaceful subsistence in remoter regions;\nand he quits the plough, resumes his native arms, and returns to the\nwilderness forever. *s The condition of the Creeks and Cherokees, to\nwhich I have already alluded, sufficiently corroborates the truth of\nthis deplorable picture.\n\n[Footnote s: The destructive influence of highly civilized nations\nupon others which are less so, has been exemplified by the Europeans\nthemselves. About a century ago the French founded the town of Vincennes\nup on the Wabash, in the middle of the desert; and they lived there\nin great plenty until the arrival of the American settlers, who first\nruined the previous inhabitants by their competition, and afterwards\npurchased their lands at a very low rate. At the time when M. de Volney,\nfrom whom I borrow these details, passed through Vincennes, the number\nof the French was reduced to a hundred individuals, most of whom were\nabout to pass over to Louisiana or to Canada. These French settlers were\nworthy people, but idle and uninstructed: they had contracted many of\nthe habits of savages. The Americans, who were perhaps their inferiors,\nin a moral point of view, were immeasurably superior to them in\nintelligence: they were industrious, well informed, rich, and accustomed\nto govern their own community.\n\nI myself saw in Canada, where the intellectual difference between the\ntwo races is less striking, that the English are the masters of commerce\nand manufacture in the Canadian country, that they spread on all sides,\nand confine the French within limits which scarcely suffice to contain\nthem. In like manner, in Louisiana, almost all activity in commerce and\nmanufacture centres in the hands of the Anglo-Americans.\n\n\nBut the case of Texas is still more striking: the State of Texas is a\npart of Mexico, and lies upon the frontier between that country and the\nUnited States. In the course of the last few years the Anglo-Americans\nhave penetrated into this province, which is still thinly peopled; they\npurchase land, they produce the commodities of the country, and supplant\nthe original population. It may easily be foreseen that if Mexico takes\nno steps to check this change, the province of Texas will very shortly\ncease to belong to that government.\n\nIf the different degrees--comparatively so slight--which exist\nin European civilization produce results of such magnitude, the\nconsequences which must ensue from the collision of the most perfect\nEuropean civilization with Indian savages may readily be conceived.]\n\nThe Indians, in the little which they have done, have unquestionably\ndisplayed as much natural genius as the peoples of Europe in their most\nimportant designs; but nations as well as men require time to learn,\nwhatever may be their intelligence and their zeal. Whilst the savages\nwere engaged in the work of civilization, the Europeans continued to\nsurround them on every side, and to confine them within narrower limits;\nthe two races gradually met, and they are now in immediate juxtaposition\nto each other. The Indian is already superior to his barbarous parent,\nbut he is still very far below his white neighbor. With their resources\nand acquired knowledge, the Europeans soon appropriated to themselves\nmost of the advantages which the natives might have derived from the\npossession of the soil; they have settled in the country, they have\npurchased land at a very low rate or have occupied it by force, and the\nIndians have been ruined by a competition which they had not the means\nof resisting. They were isolated in their own country, and their race\nonly constituted a colony of troublesome aliens in the midst of a\nnumerous and domineering people. *t\n\n[Footnote t: See in the Legislative Documents (21st Congress, No. 89)\ninstances of excesses of every kind committed by the whites upon the\nterritory of the Indians, either in taking possession of a part of their\nlands, until compelled to retire by the troops of Congress, or carrying\noff their cattle, burning their houses, cutting down their corn, and\ndoing violence to their persons. It appears, nevertheless, from all\nthese documents that the claims of the natives are constantly\nprotected by the government from the abuse of force. The Union has a\nrepresentative agent continually employed to reside among the Indians;\nand the report of the Cherokee agent, which is among the documents\nI have referred to, is almost always favorable to the Indians. \"The\nintrusion of whites,\" he says, \"upon the lands of the Cherokees would\ncause ruin to the poor, helpless, and inoffensive inhabitants.\" And he\nfurther remarks upon the attempt of the State of Georgia to establish\na division line for the purpose of limiting the boundaries of the\nCherokees, that the line drawn having been made by the whites, and\nentirely upon ex parte evidence of their several rights, was of no\nvalidity whatever.]\n\n\nWashington said in one of his messages to Congress, \"We are more\nenlightened and more powerful than the Indian nations, we are therefore\nbound in honor to treat them with kindness and even with generosity.\"\nBut this virtuous and high-minded policy has not been followed. The\nrapacity of the settlers is usually backed by the tyranny of the\ngovernment. Although the Cherokees and the Creeks are established\nupon the territory which they inhabited before the settlement of the\nEuropeans, and although the Americans have frequently treated with them\nas with foreign nations, the surrounding States have not consented to\nacknowledge them as independent peoples, and attempts have been made to\nsubject these children of the woods to Anglo-American magistrates, laws,\nand customs. *u Destitution had driven these unfortunate Indians to\ncivilization, and oppression now drives them back to their former\ncondition: many of them abandon the soil which they had begun to clear,\nand return to their savage course of life.\n\n[Footnote u: In 1829 the State of Alabama divided the Creek territory\ninto counties, and subjected the Indian population to the power of\nEuropean magistrates.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part III\n\nIn 1830 the State of Mississippi assimilated the Choctaws and Chickasaws\nto the white population, and declared that any of them that should take\nthe title of chief would be punished by a fine of $1,000 and a year's\nimprisonment. When these laws were enforced upon the Choctaws, who\ninhabited that district, the tribe assembled, their chief communicated\nto them the intentions of the whites, and read to them some of the laws\nto which it was intended that they should submit; and they unanimously\ndeclared that it was better at once to retreat again into the wilds.]\n\nIf we consider the tyrannical measures which have been adopted by the\nlegislatures of the Southern States, the conduct of their Governors, and\nthe decrees of their courts of justice, we shall be convinced that the\nentire expulsion of the Indians is the final result to which the efforts\nof their policy are directed. The Americans of that part of the Union\nlook with jealousy upon the aborigines, *v they are aware that these\ntribes have not yet lost the traditions of savage life, and before\ncivilization has permanently fixed them to the soil, it is intended\nto force them to recede by reducing them to despair. The Creeks and\nCherokees, oppressed by the several States, have appealed to the central\ngovernment, which is by no means insensible to their misfortunes, and\nis sincerely desirous of saving the remnant of the natives, and of\nmaintaining them in the free possession of that territory, which\nthe Union is pledged to respect. *w But the several States oppose\nso formidable a resistance to the execution of this design, that the\ngovernment is obliged to consent to the extirpation of a few barbarous\ntribes in order not to endanger the safety of the American Union.\n\n[Footnote v: The Georgians, who are so much annoyed by the proximity of\nthe Indians, inhabit a territory which does not at present contain\nmore than seven inhabitants to the square mile. In France there are one\nhundred and sixty-two inhabitants to the same extent of country.]\n\n[Footnote w: In 1818 Congress appointed commissioners to visit the\nArkansas Territory, accompanied by a deputation of Creeks, Choctaws, and\nChickasaws. This expedition was commanded by Messrs. Kennerly,\nM'Coy, Wash Hood, and John Bell. See the different reports of the\ncommissioners, and their journal, in the Documents of Congress, No. 87,\nHouse of Representatives.]\n\nBut the federal government, which is not able to protect the Indians,\nwould fain mitigate the hardships of their lot; and, with this\nintention, proposals have been made to transport them into more remote\nregions at the public cost.\n\nBetween the thirty-third and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude,\na vast tract of country lies, which has taken the name of Arkansas, from\nthe principal river that waters its extent. It is bounded on the\none side by the confines of Mexico, on the other by the Mississippi.\nNumberless streams cross it in every direction; the climate is mild, and\nthe soil productive, but it is only inhabited by a few wandering hordes\nof savages. The government of the Union wishes to transport the broken\nremnants of the indigenous population of the South to the portion of\nthis country which is nearest to Mexico, and at a great distance from\nthe American settlements.\n\nWe were assured, towards the end of the year 1831, that 10,000\nIndians had already gone down to the shores of the Arkansas; and fresh\ndetachments were constantly following them; but Congress has been unable\nto excite a unanimous determination in those whom it is disposed to\nprotect. Some, indeed, are willing to quit the seat of oppression, but\nthe most enlightened members of the community refuse to abandon their\nrecent dwellings and their springing crops; they are of opinion that the\nwork of civilization, once interrupted, will never be resumed; they fear\nthat those domestic habits which have been so recently contracted, may\nbe irrevocably lost in the midst of a country which is still barbarous,\nand where nothing is prepared for the subsistence of an agricultural\npeople; they know that their entrance into those wilds will be opposed\nby inimical hordes, and that they have lost the energy of barbarians,\nwithout acquiring the resources of civilization to resist their attacks.\nMoreover, the Indians readily discover that the settlement which is\nproposed to them is merely a temporary expedient. Who can assure them\nthat they will at length be allowed to dwell in peace in their new\nretreat? The United States pledge themselves to the observance of the\nobligation; but the territory which they at present occupy was formerly\nsecured to them by the most solemn oaths of Anglo-American faith. *x\nThe American government does not indeed rob them of their lands, but it\nallows perpetual incursions to be made on them. In a few years the same\nwhite population which now flocks around them, will track them to the\nsolitudes of the Arkansas; they will then be exposed to the same evils\nwithout the same remedies, and as the limits of the earth will at last\nfail them, their only refuge is the grave.\n\n[Footnote x: The fifth article of the treaty made with the Creeks in\nAugust, 1790, is in the following words:--\"The United States solemnly\nguarantee to the Creek nation all their land within the limits of the\nUnited States.\"\n\nThe seventh article of the treaty concluded in 1791 with the Cherokees\nsays:--\"The United States solemnly guarantee to the Cherokee nation all\ntheir lands not hereby ceded.\" The following article declared that if\nany citizen of the United States or other settler not of the Indian race\nshould establish himself upon the territory of the Cherokees, the United\nStates would withdraw their protection from that individual, and give\nhim up to be punished as the Cherokee nation should think fit.]\n\nThe Union treats the Indians with less cupidity and rigor than the\npolicy of the several States, but the two governments are alike\ndestitute of good faith. The States extend what they are pleased to term\nthe benefits of their laws to the Indians, with a belief that the\ntribes will recede rather than submit; and the central government, which\npromises a permanent refuge to these unhappy beings is well aware of its\ninability to secure it to them. *y\n\n[Footnote y: This does not prevent them from promising in the most\nsolemn manner to do so. See the letter of the President addressed to the\nCreek Indians, March 23, 1829 (Proceedings of the Indian Board, in the\ncity of New York, p. 5): \"Beyond the great river Mississippi, where a\npart of your nation has gone, your father has provided a country large\nenough for all of you, and he advises you to remove to it. There your\nwhite brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the\nland, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as\nthe grass grows, or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be\nyours forever.\"\n\nThe Secretary of War, in a letter written to the Cherokees, April 18,\n1829, (see the same work, p. 6), declares to them that they cannot\nexpect to retain possession of the lands at that time occupied by them,\nbut gives them the most positive assurance of uninterrupted peace if\nthey would remove beyond the Mississippi: as if the power which\ncould not grant them protection then, would be able to afford it them\nhereafter!]\n\nThus the tyranny of the States obliges the savages to retire, the Union,\nby its promises and resources, facilitates their retreat; and these\nmeasures tend to precisely the same end. *z \"By the will of our Father\nin Heaven, the Governor of the whole world,\" said the Cherokees in their\npetition to Congress, *a \"the red man of America has become small, and\nthe white man great and renowned. When the ancestors of the people of\nthese United States first came to the shores of America they found the\nred man strong: though he was ignorant and savage, yet he received them\nkindly, and gave them dry land to rest their weary feet. They met in\npeace, and shook hands in token of friendship. Whatever the white man\nwanted and asked of the Indian, the latter willingly gave. At that time\nthe Indian was the lord, and the white man the suppliant. But now the\nscene has changed. The strength of the red man has become weakness. As\nhis neighbors increased in numbers his power became less and less,\nand now, of the many and powerful tribes who once covered these United\nStates, only a few are to be seen--a few whom a sweeping pestilence has\nleft. The northern tribes, who were once so numerous and powerful, are\nnow nearly extinct. Thus it has happened to the red man of America.\nShall we, who are remnants, share the same fate?\"\n\n[Footnote z: To obtain a correct idea of the policy pursued by the\nseveral States and the Union with respect to the Indians, it is\nnecessary to consult, 1st, \"The Laws of the Colonial and State\nGovernments relating to the Indian Inhabitants.\" (See the Legislative\nDocuments, 21st Congress, No. 319.) 2d, The Laws of the Union on the\nsame subject, and especially that of March 30, 1802. (See Story's \"Laws\nof the United States.\") 3d, The Report of Mr. Cass, Secretary of War,\nrelative to Indian Affairs, November 29, 1823.]\n\n[Footnote a: December 18, 1829.]\n\n\"The land on which we stand we have received as an inheritance from\nour fathers, who possessed it from time immemorial, as a gift from our\ncommon Father in Heaven. They bequeathed it to us as their children, and\nwe have sacredly kept it, as containing the remains of our beloved men.\nThis right of inheritance we have never ceded nor ever forfeited. Permit\nus to ask what better right can the people have to a country than the\nright of inheritance and immemorial peaceable possession? We know it is\nsaid of late by the State of Georgia and by the Executive of the United\nStates, that we have forfeited this right; but we think this is said\ngratuitously. At what time have we made the forfeit? What great crime\nhave we committed, whereby we must forever be divested of our country\nand rights? Was it when we were hostile to the United States, and\ntook part with the King of Great Britain, during the struggle for\nindependence? If so, why was not this forfeiture declared in the first\ntreaty of peace between the United States and our beloved men? Why\nwas not such an article as the following inserted in the treaty:--'The\nUnited States give peace to the Cherokees, but, for the part they took\nin the late war, declare them to be but tenants at will, to be removed\nwhen the convenience of the States, within whose chartered limits they\nlive, shall require it'? That was the proper time to assume such a\npossession. But it was not thought of, nor would our forefathers have\nagreed to any treaty whose tendency was to deprive them of their rights\nand their country.\"\n\nSuch is the language of the Indians: their assertions are true, their\nforebodings inevitable. From whichever side we consider the destinies\nof the aborigines of North America, their calamities appear to be\nirremediable: if they continue barbarous, they are forced to retire; if\nthey attempt to civilize their manners, the contact of a more civilized\ncommunity subjects them to oppression and destitution. They perish if\nthey continue to wander from waste to waste, and if they attempt to\nsettle they still must perish; the assistance of Europeans is necessary\nto instruct them, but the approach of Europeans corrupts and repels them\ninto savage life; they refuse to change their habits as long as their\nsolitudes are their own, and it is too late to change them when they are\nconstrained to submit.\n\nThe Spaniards pursued the Indians with bloodhounds, like wild beasts;\nthey sacked the New World with no more temper or compassion than a city\ntaken by storm; but destruction must cease, and frenzy be stayed; the\nremnant of the Indian population which had escaped the massacre mixed\nwith its conquerors, and adopted in the end their religion and their\nmanners. *b The conduct of the Americans of the United States towards\nthe aborigines is characterized, on the other hand, by a singular\nattachment to the formalities of law. Provided that the Indians retain\ntheir barbarous condition, the Americans take no part in their affairs;\nthey treat them as independent nations, and do not possess themselves\nof their hunting grounds without a treaty of purchase; and if an Indian\nnation happens to be so encroached upon as to be unable to subsist upon\nits territory, they afford it brotherly assistance in transporting it to\na grave sufficiently remote from the land of its fathers.\n\n[Footnote b: The honor of this result is, however, by no means due to\nthe Spaniards. If the Indian tribes had not been tillers of the ground\nat the time of the arrival of the Europeans, they would unquestionably\nhave been destroyed in South as well as in North America.]\n\nThe Spaniards were unable to exterminate the Indian race by those\nunparalleled atrocities which brand them with indelible shame, nor\ndid they even succeed in wholly depriving it of its rights; but the\nAmericans of the United States have accomplished this twofold purpose\nwith singular felicity; tranquilly, legally, philanthropically, without\nshedding blood, and without violating a single great principle of\nmorality in the eyes of the world. *c It is impossible to destroy men\nwith more respect for the laws of humanity.\n\n[Footnote c: See, amongst other documents, the report made by Mr. Bell\nin the name of the Committee on Indian Affairs, February 24, 1830, in\nwhich is most logically established and most learnedly proved, that \"the\nfundamental principle that the Indians had no right by virtue of\ntheir ancient possession either of will or sovereignty, has never been\nabandoned either expressly or by implication.\" In perusing this report,\nwhich is evidently drawn up by an experienced hand, one is astonished\nat the facility with which the author gets rid of all arguments founded\nupon reason and natural right, which he designates as abstract and\ntheoretical principles. The more I contemplate the difference between\ncivilized and uncivilized man with regard to the principles of justice,\nthe more I observe that the former contests the justice of those rights\nwhich the latter simply violates.]\n\n[I leave this chapter wholly unchanged, for it has always appeared to me\nto be one of the most eloquent and touching parts of this book. But it\nhas ceased to be prophetic; the destruction of the Indian race in the\nUnited States is already consummated. In 1870 there remained but 25,731\nIndians in the whole territory of the Union, and of these by far the\nlargest part exist in California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Dakota, and New\nMexico and Nevada. In New England, Pennsylvania, and New York the race\nis extinct; and the predictions of M. de Tocqueville are fulfilled.\n--Translator's Note.]\n\nSituation Of The Black Population In The United States, And Dangers With\nWhich Its Presence Threatens The Whites\n\nWhy it is more difficult to abolish slavery, and to efface all vestiges\nof it amongst the moderns than it was amongst the ancients--In the\nUnited States the prejudices of the Whites against the Blacks seem to\nincrease in proportion as slavery is abolished--Situation of the\nNegroes in the Northern and Southern States--Why the Americans\nabolish slavery--Servitude, which debases the slave, impoverishes the\nmaster--Contrast between the left and the right bank of the Ohio--To\nwhat attributable--The Black race, as well as slavery, recedes towards\nthe South--Explanation of this fact--Difficulties attendant upon\nthe abolition of slavery in the South--Dangers to come--General\nanxiety--Foundation of a Black colony in Africa--Why the Americans of\nthe South increase the hardships of slavery, whilst they are distressed\nat its continuance.\n\nThe Indians will perish in the same isolated condition in which they\nhave lived; but the destiny of the negroes is in some measure interwoven\nwith that of the Europeans. These two races are attached to each other\nwithout intermingling, and they are alike unable entirely to separate\nor to combine. The most formidable of all the ills which threaten\nthe future existence of the Union arises from the presence of a black\npopulation upon its territory; and in contemplating the cause of the\npresent embarrassments or of the future dangers of the United States,\nthe observer is invariably led to consider this as a primary fact.\n\nThe permanent evils to which mankind is subjected are usually produced\nby the vehement or the increasing efforts of men; but there is one\ncalamity which penetrated furtively into the world, and which was at\nfirst scarcely distinguishable amidst the ordinary abuses of power; it\noriginated with an individual whose name history has not preserved; it\nwas wafted like some accursed germ upon a portion of the soil, but it\nafterwards nurtured itself, grew without effort, and spreads naturally\nwith the society to which it belongs. I need scarcely add that this\ncalamity is slavery. Christianity suppressed slavery, but the Christians\nof the sixteenth century re-established it--as an exception, indeed, to\ntheir social system, and restricted to one of the races of mankind; but\nthe wound thus inflicted upon humanity, though less extensive, was at\nthe same time rendered far more difficult of cure.\n\nIt is important to make an accurate distinction between slavery itself\nand its consequences. The immediate evils which are produced by slavery\nwere very nearly the same in antiquity as they are amongst the moderns;\nbut the consequences of these evils were different. The slave, amongst\nthe ancients, belonged to the same race as his master, and he was often\nthe superior of the two in education *d and instruction. Freedom was the\nonly distinction between them; and when freedom was conferred they were\neasily confounded together. The ancients, then, had a very simple\nmeans of avoiding slavery and its evil consequences, which was that of\naffranchisement; and they succeeded as soon as they adopted this\nmeasure generally. Not but, in ancient States, the vestiges of servitude\nsubsisted for some time after servitude itself was abolished. There is a\nnatural prejudice which prompts men to despise whomsoever has been their\ninferior long after he is become their equal; and the real inequality\nwhich is produced by fortune or by law is always succeeded by an\nimaginary inequality which is implanted in the manners of the people.\nNevertheless, this secondary consequence of slavery was limited to a\ncertain term amongst the ancients, for the freedman bore so entire\na resemblance to those born free, that it soon became impossible to\ndistinguish him from amongst them.\n\n[Footnote d: It is well known that several of the most distinguished\nauthors of antiquity, and amongst them Aesop and Terence, were, or had\nbeen slaves. Slaves were not always taken from barbarous nations, and\nthe chances of war reduced highly civilized men to servitude.]\n\nThe greatest difficulty in antiquity was that of altering the law;\namongst the moderns it is that of altering the manners; and, as far as\nwe are concerned, the real obstacles begin where those of the ancients\nleft off. This arises from the circumstance that, amongst the moderns,\nthe abstract and transient fact of slavery is fatally united to the\nphysical and permanent fact of color. The tradition of slavery dishonors\nthe race, and the peculiarity of the race perpetuates the tradition of\nslavery. No African has ever voluntarily emigrated to the shores of the\nNew World; whence it must be inferred, that all the blacks who are now\nto be found in that hemisphere are either slaves or freedmen. Thus the\nnegro transmits the eternal mark of his ignominy to all his descendants;\nand although the law may abolish slavery, God alone can obliterate the\ntraces of its existence.\n\nThe modern slave differs from his master not only in his condition,\nbut in his origin. You may set the negro free, but you cannot make him\notherwise than an alien to the European. Nor is this all; we scarcely\nacknowledge the common features of mankind in this child of debasement\nwhom slavery has brought amongst us. His physiognomy is to our eyes\nhideous, his understanding weak, his tastes low; and we are almost\ninclined to look upon him as a being intermediate between man and the\nbrutes. *e The moderns, then, after they have abolished slavery, have\nthree prejudices to contend against, which are less easy to attack and\nfar less easy to conquer than the mere fact of servitude: the prejudice\nof the master, the prejudice of the race, and the prejudice of color.\n\n[Footnote e: To induce the whites to abandon the opinion they have\nconceived of the moral and intellectual inferiority of their former\nslaves, the negroes must change; but as long as this opinion subsists,\nto change is impossible.]\n\nIt is difficult for us, who have had the good fortune to be born amongst\nmen like ourselves by nature, and equal to ourselves by law, to conceive\nthe irreconcilable differences which separate the negro from the\nEuropean in America. But we may derive some faint notion of them from\nanalogy. France was formerly a country in which numerous distinctions of\nrank existed, that had been created by the legislation. Nothing can be\nmore fictitious than a purely legal inferiority; nothing more contrary\nto the instinct of mankind than these permanent divisions which had\nbeen established between beings evidently similar. Nevertheless these\ndivisions subsisted for ages; they still subsist in many places; and\non all sides they have left imaginary vestiges, which time alone can\nefface. If it be so difficult to root out an inequality which solely\noriginates in the law, how are those distinctions to be destroyed which\nseem to be based upon the immutable laws of Nature herself? When I\nremember the extreme difficulty with which aristocratic bodies, of\nwhatever nature they may be, are commingled with the mass of the people;\nand the exceeding care which they take to preserve the ideal boundaries\nof their caste inviolate, I despair of seeing an aristocracy disappear\nwhich is founded upon visible and indelible signs. Those who hope that\nthe Europeans will ever mix with the negroes, appear to me to delude\nthemselves; and I am not led to any such conclusion by my own reason, or\nby the evidence of facts.\n\nHitherto, wherever the whites have been the most powerful, they have\nmaintained the blacks in a subordinate or a servile position; wherever\nthe negroes have been strongest they have destroyed the whites; such\nhas been the only retribution which has ever taken place between the two\nraces.\n\nI see that in a certain portion of the territory of the United States\nat the present day, the legal barrier which separated the two races is\ntending to fall away, but not that which exists in the manners of the\ncountry; slavery recedes, but the prejudice to which it has given birth\nremains stationary. Whosoever has inhabited the United States must have\nperceived that in those parts of the Union in which the negroes are no\nlonger slaves, they have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites. On the\ncontrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the States\nwhich have abolished slavery, than in those where it still exists; and\nnowhere is it so intolerant as in those States where servitude has never\nbeen known.\n\nIt is true, that in the North of the Union, marriages may be legally\ncontracted between negroes and whites; but public opinion would\nstigmatize a man who should connect himself with a negress as infamous,\nand it would be difficult to meet with a single instance of such a\nunion. The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the negroes in\nalmost all the States in which slavery has been abolished; but if they\ncome forward to vote, their lives are in danger. If oppressed, they may\nbring an action at law, but they will find none but whites amongst\ntheir judges; and although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice\nrepulses them from that office. The same schools do not receive the\nchild of the black and of the European. In the theatres, gold cannot\nprocure a seat for the servile race beside their former masters; in the\nhospitals they lie apart; and although they are allowed to invoke the\nsame Divinity as the whites, it must be at a different altar, and in\ntheir own churches, with their own clergy. The gates of Heaven are not\nclosed against these unhappy beings; but their inferiority is continued\nto the very confines of the other world; when the negro is defunct, his\nbones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails even in\nthe equality of death. The negro is free, but he can share neither the\nrights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor the afflictions, nor the\ntomb of him whose equal he has been declared to be; and he cannot meet\nhim upon fair terms in life or in death.\n\nIn the South, where slavery still exists, the negroes are less carefully\nkept apart; they sometimes share the labor and the recreations of the\nwhites; the whites consent to intermix with them to a certain extent,\nand although the legislation treats them more harshly, the habits of the\npeople are more tolerant and compassionate. In the South the master is\nnot afraid to raise his slave to his own standing, because he knows that\nhe can in a moment reduce him to the dust at pleasure. In the North the\nwhite no longer distinctly perceives the barrier which separates\nhim from the degraded race, and he shuns the negro with the more\npertinacity, since he fears lest they should some day be confounded\ntogether.\n\nAmongst the Americans of the South, nature sometimes reasserts her\nrights, and restores a transient equality between the blacks and the\nwhites; but in the North pride restrains the most imperious of human\npassions. The American of the Northern States would perhaps allow the\nnegress to share his licentious pleasures, if the laws of his country\ndid not declare that she may aspire to be the legitimate partner of his\nbed; but he recoils with horror from her who might become his wife.\n\nThus it is, in the United States, that the prejudice which repels the\nnegroes seems to increase in proportion as they are emancipated, and\ninequality is sanctioned by the manners whilst it is effaced from the\nlaws of the country. But if the relative position of the two races which\ninhabit the United States is such as I have described, it may be asked\nwhy the Americans have abolished slavery in the North of the Union,\nwhy they maintain it in the South, and why they aggravate its hardships\nthere? The answer is easily given. It is not for the good of the\nnegroes, but for that of the whites, that measures are taken to abolish\nslavery in the United States.\n\nThe first negroes were imported into Virginia about the year 1621. *f\nIn America, therefore, as well as in the rest of the globe, slavery\noriginated in the South. Thence it spread from one settlement to\nanother; but the number of slaves diminished towards the Northern\nStates, and the negro population was always very limited in New England.\n*g\n\n[Footnote f: See Beverley's \"History of Virginia.\" See also in\nJefferson's \"Memoirs\" some curious details concerning the introduction\nof negroes into Virginia, and the first Act which prohibited the\nimportation of them in 1778.]\n\n[Footnote g: The number of slaves was less considerable in the North,\nbut the advantages resulting from slavery were not more contested there\nthan in the South. In 1740, the Legislature of the State of New York\ndeclared that the direct importation of slaves ought to be encouraged\nas much as possible, and smuggling severely punished in order not to\ndiscourage the fair trader. (Kent's \"Commentaries,\" vol. ii. p. 206.)\nCurious researches, by Belknap, upon slavery in New England, are to be\nfound in the \"Historical Collection of Massachusetts,\" vol. iv. p. 193.\nIt appears that negroes were introduced there in 1630, but that the\nlegislation and manners of the people were opposed to slavery from the\nfirst; see also, in the same work, the manner in which public opinion,\nand afterwards the laws, finally put an end to slavery.]\n\nA century had scarcely elapsed since the foundation of the colonies,\nwhen the attention of the planters was struck by the extraordinary\nfact, that the provinces which were comparatively destitute of slaves,\nincreased in population, in wealth, and in prosperity more rapidly than\nthose which contained the greatest number of negroes. In the former,\nhowever, the inhabitants were obliged to cultivate the soil themselves,\nor by hired laborers; in the latter they were furnished with hands for\nwhich they paid no wages; yet although labor and expenses were on\nthe one side, and ease with economy on the other, the former were in\npossession of the most advantageous system. This consequence seemed to\nbe the more difficult to explain, since the settlers, who all belonged\nto the same European race, had the same habits, the same civilization,\nthe same laws, and their shades of difference were extremely slight.\n\nTime, however, continued to advance, and the Anglo-Americans, spreading\nbeyond the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, penetrated farther and farther\ninto the solitudes of the West; they met with a new soil and an unwonted\nclimate; the obstacles which opposed them were of the most various\ncharacter; their races intermingled, the inhabitants of the South went\nup towards the North, those of the North descended to the South; but in\nthe midst of all these causes, the same result occurred at every step,\nand in general, the colonies in which there were no slaves became more\npopulous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished. The more\nprogress was made, the more was it shown that slavery, which is so cruel\nto the slave, is prejudicial to the master.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part IV\n\nBut this truth was most satisfactorily demonstrated when civilization\nreached the banks of the Ohio. The stream which the Indians had\ndistinguished by the name of Ohio, or Beautiful River, waters one of\nthe most magnificent valleys that has ever been made the abode of man.\nUndulating lands extend upon both shores of the Ohio, whose soil affords\ninexhaustible treasures to the laborer; on either bank the air is\nwholesome and the climate mild, and each of them forms the extreme\nfrontier of a vast State: That which follows the numerous windings of\nthe Ohio upon the left is called Kentucky, that upon the right bears\nthe name of the river. These two States only differ in a single respect;\nKentucky has admitted slavery, but the State of Ohio has prohibited the\nexistence of slaves within its borders. *h\n\n[Footnote h: Not only is slavery prohibited in Ohio, but no free negroes\nare allowed to enter the territory of that State, or to hold property in\nit. See the Statutes of Ohio.]\n\nThus the traveller who floats down the current of the Ohio to the spot\nwhere that river falls into the Mississippi, may be said to sail between\nliberty and servitude; and a transient inspection of the surrounding\nobjects will convince him as to which of the two is most favorable to\nmankind. Upon the left bank of the stream the population is rare; from\ntime to time one descries a troop of slaves loitering in the half-desert\nfields; the primaeval forest recurs at every turn; society seems to be\nasleep, man to be idle, and nature alone offers a scene of activity and\nof life. From the right bank, on the contrary, a confused hum is heard\nwhich proclaims the presence of industry; the fields are covered with\nabundant harvests, the elegance of the dwellings announces the taste and\nactivity of the laborer, and man appears to be in the enjoyment of that\nwealth and contentment which is the reward of labor. *i\n\n[Footnote i: The activity of Ohio is not confined to individuals, but\nthe undertakings of the State are surprisingly great; a canal has been\nestablished between Lake Erie and the Ohio, by means of which the valley\nof the Mississippi communicates with the river of the North, and the\nEuropean commodities which arrive at New York may be forwarded by water\nto New Orleans across five hundred leagues of continent.]\n\nThe State of Kentucky was founded in 1775, the State of Ohio only twelve\nyears later; but twelve years are more in America than half a century in\nEurope, and, at the present day, the population of Ohio exceeds that\nof Kentucky by two hundred and fifty thousand souls. *j These opposite\nconsequences of slavery and freedom may readily be understood, and they\nsuffice to explain many of the differences which we remark between the\ncivilization of antiquity and that of our own time.\n\n[Footnote j: The exact numbers given by the census of 1830 were:\nKentucky, 688,-844; Ohio, 937,679. [In 1890 the population of Ohio was\n3,672,316, that of Kentucky, 1,858,635.]]\n\nUpon the left bank of the Ohio labor is confounded with the idea of\nslavery, upon the right bank it is identified with that of prosperity\nand improvement; on the one side it is degraded, on the other it is\nhonored; on the former territory no white laborers can be found, for\nthey would be afraid of assimilating themselves to the negroes; on the\nlatter no one is idle, for the white population extends its activity and\nits intelligence to every kind of employment. Thus the men whose task\nit is to cultivate the rich soil of Kentucky are ignorant and lukewarm;\nwhilst those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass\nover into the State of Ohio, where they may work without dishonor.\n\nIt is true that in Kentucky the planters are not obliged to pay wages\nto the slaves whom they employ; but they derive small profits from their\nlabor, whilst the wages paid to free workmen would be returned with\ninterest in the value of their services. The free workman is paid, but\nhe does his work quicker than the slave, and rapidity of execution is\none of the great elements of economy. The white sells his services, but\nthey are only purchased at the times at which they may be useful; the\nblack can claim no remuneration for his toil, but the expense of his\nmaintenance is perpetual; he must be supported in his old age as well\nas in the prime of manhood, in his profitless infancy as well as in\nthe productive years of youth. Payment must equally be made in order to\nobtain the services of either class of men: the free workman receives\nhis wages in money, the slave in education, in food, in care, and in\nclothing. The money which a master spends in the maintenance of his\nslaves goes gradually and in detail, so that it is scarcely perceived;\nthe salary of the free workman is paid in a round sum, which appears\nonly to enrich the individual who receives it, but in the end the slave\nhas cost more than the free servant, and his labor is less productive.\n*k\n\n[Footnote k: Independently of these causes, which, wherever free workmen\nabound, render their labor more productive and more economical than that\nof slaves, another cause may be pointed out which is peculiar to the\nUnited States: the sugar-cane has hitherto been cultivated with success\nonly upon the banks of the Mississippi, near the mouth of that river in\nthe Gulf of Mexico. In Louisiana the cultivation of the sugar-cane is\nexceedingly lucrative, and nowhere does a laborer earn so much by his\nwork, and, as there is always a certain relation between the cost of\nproduction and the value of the produce, the price of slaves is very\nhigh in Louisiana. But Louisiana is one of the confederated States, and\nslaves may be carried thither from all parts of the Union; the price\ngiven for slaves in New Orleans consequently raises the value of slaves\nin all the other markets. The consequence of this is, that in the\ncountries where the land is less productive, the cost of slave labor\nis still very considerable, which gives an additional advantage to the\ncompetition of free labor.]\n\nThe influence of slavery extends still further; it affects the character\nof the master, and imparts a peculiar tendency to his ideas and his\ntastes. Upon both banks of the Ohio, the character of the inhabitants is\nenterprising and energetic; but this vigor is very differently exercised\nin the two States. The white inhabitant of Ohio, who is obliged to\nsubsist by his own exertions, regards temporal prosperity as the\nprincipal aim of his existence; and as the country which he occupies\npresents inexhaustible resources to his industry and ever-varying lures\nto his activity, his acquisitive ardor surpasses the ordinary limits of\nhuman cupidity: he is tormented by the desire of wealth, and he boldly\nenters upon every path which fortune opens to him; he becomes a sailor,\na pioneer, an artisan, or a laborer with the same indifference, and he\nsupports, with equal constancy, the fatigues and the dangers incidental\nto these various professions; the resources of his intelligence are\nastonishing, and his avidity in the pursuit of gain amounts to a species\nof heroism.\n\nBut the Kentuckian scorns not only labor, but all the undertakings which\nlabor promotes; as he lives in an idle independence, his tastes are\nthose of an idle man; money loses a portion of its value in his eyes;\nhe covets wealth much less than pleasure and excitement; and the energy\nwhich his neighbor devotes to gain, turns with him to a passionate love\nof field sports and military exercises; he delights in violent bodily\nexertion, he is familiar with the use of arms, and is accustomed from\na very early age to expose his life in single combat. Thus slavery not\nonly prevents the whites from becoming opulent, but even from desiring\nto become so.\n\nAs the same causes have been continually producing opposite effects for\nthe last two centuries in the British colonies of North America, they\nhave established a very striking difference between the commercial\ncapacity of the inhabitants of the South and those of the North. At the\npresent day it is only the Northern States which are in possession\nof shipping, manufactures, railroads, and canals. This difference is\nperceptible not only in comparing the North with the South, but in\ncomparing the several Southern States. Almost all the individuals who\ncarry on commercial operations, or who endeavor to turn slave labor to\naccount in the most Southern districts of the Union, have emigrated from\nthe North. The natives of the Northern States are constantly spreading\nover that portion of the American territory where they have less to fear\nfrom competition; they discover resources there which escaped the notice\nof the inhabitants; and, as they comply with a system which they do not\napprove, they succeed in turning it to better advantage than those who\nfirst founded and who still maintain it.\n\nWere I inclined to continue this parallel, I could easily prove that\nalmost all the differences which may be remarked between the characters\nof the Americans in the Southern and in the Northern States have\noriginated in slavery; but this would divert me from my subject, and my\npresent intention is not to point out all the consequences of servitude,\nbut those effects which it has produced upon the prosperity of the\ncountries which have admitted it.\n\nThe influence of slavery upon the production of wealth must have been\nvery imperfectly known in antiquity, as slavery then obtained throughout\nthe civilized world; and the nations which were unacquainted with\nit were barbarous. And indeed Christianity only abolished slavery\nby advocating the claims of the slave; at the present time it may be\nattacked in the name of the master, and, upon this point, interest is\nreconciled with morality.\n\nAs these truths became apparent in the United States, slavery receded\nbefore the progress of experience. Servitude had begun in the South, and\nhad thence spread towards the North; but it now retires again. Freedom,\nwhich started from the North, now descends uninterruptedly towards\nthe South. Amongst the great States, Pennsylvania now constitutes the\nextreme limit of slavery to the North: but even within those limits\nthe slave system is shaken: Maryland, which is immediately below\nPennsylvania, is preparing for its abolition; and Virginia, which comes\nnext to Maryland, is already discussing its utility and its dangers. *l\n\n[Footnote l: A peculiar reason contributes to detach the two\nlast-mentioned States from the cause of slavery. The former wealth of\nthis part of the Union was principally derived from the cultivation of\ntobacco. This cultivation is specially carried on by slaves; but within\nthe last few years the market-price of tobacco has diminished, whilst\nthe value of the slaves remains the same. Thus the ratio between the\ncost of production and the value of the produce is changed. The natives\nof Maryland and Virginia are therefore more disposed than they were\nthirty years ago, to give up slave labor in the cultivation of tobacco,\nor to give up slavery and tobacco at the same time.]\n\nNo great change takes place in human institutions without involving\namongst its causes the law of inheritance. When the law of primogeniture\nobtained in the South, each family was represented by a wealthy\nindividual, who was neither compelled nor induced to labor; and he was\nsurrounded, as by parasitic plants, by the other members of his family\nwho were then excluded by law from sharing the common inheritance,\nand who led the same kind of life as himself. The very same thing\nthen occurred in all the families of the South as still happens in the\nwealthy families of some countries in Europe, namely, that the younger\nsons remain in the same state of idleness as their elder brother,\nwithout being as rich as he is. This identical result seems to be\nproduced in Europe and in America by wholly analogous causes. In\nthe South of the United States the whole race of whites formed an\naristocratic body, which was headed by a certain number of privileged\nindividuals, whose wealth was permanent, and whose leisure was\nhereditary. These leaders of the American nobility kept alive the\ntraditional prejudices of the white race in the body of which they were\nthe representatives, and maintained the honor of inactive life. This\naristocracy contained many who were poor, but none who would work; its\nmembers preferred want to labor, consequently no competition was set on\nfoot against negro laborers and slaves, and, whatever opinion might be\nentertained as to the utility of their efforts, it was indispensable to\nemploy them, since there was no one else to work.\n\nNo sooner was the law of primogeniture abolished than fortunes began\nto diminish, and all the families of the country were simultaneously\nreduced to a state in which labor became necessary to procure the means\nof subsistence: several of them have since entirely disappeared, and\nall of them learned to look forward to the time at which it would be\nnecessary for everyone to provide for his own wants. Wealthy individuals\nare still to be met with, but they no longer constitute a compact and\nhereditary body, nor have they been able to adopt a line of conduct in\nwhich they could persevere, and which they could infuse into all ranks\nof society. The prejudice which stigmatized labor was in the first place\nabandoned by common consent; the number of needy men was increased, and\nthe needy were allowed to gain a laborious subsistence without blushing\nfor their exertions. Thus one of the most immediate consequences of the\npartible quality of estates has been to create a class of free laborers.\nAs soon as a competition was set on foot between the free laborer and\nthe slave, the inferiority of the latter became manifest, and slavery\nwas attacked in its fundamental principle, which is the interest of the\nmaster.\n\nAs slavery recedes, the black population follows its retrograde course,\nand returns with it towards those tropical regions from which it\noriginally came. However singular this fact may at first appear to\nbe, it may readily be explained. Although the Americans abolish the\nprinciple of slavery, they do not set their slaves free. To illustrate\nthis remark, I will quote the example of the State of New York. In 1788,\nthe State of New York prohibited the sale of slaves within its limits,\nwhich was an indirect method of prohibiting the importation of blacks.\nThenceforward the number of negroes could only increase according to\nthe ratio of the natural increase of population. But eight years later\na more decisive measure was taken, and it was enacted that all children\nborn of slave parents after July 4, 1799, should be free. No increase\ncould then take place, and although slaves still existed, slavery might\nbe said to be abolished.\n\nFrom the time at which a Northern State prohibited the importation of\nslaves, no slaves were brought from the South to be sold in its markets.\nOn the other hand, as the sale of slaves was forbidden in that State,\nan owner was no longer able to get rid of his slave (who thus became a\nburdensome possession) otherwise than by transporting him to the South.\nBut when a Northern State declared that the son of the slave should be\nborn free, the slave lost a large portion of his market value, since his\nposterity was no longer included in the bargain, and the owner had then\na strong interest in transporting him to the South. Thus the same law\nprevents the slaves of the South from coming to the Northern States, and\ndrives those of the North to the South.\n\nThe want of free hands is felt in a State in proportion as the number of\nslaves decreases. But in proportion as labor is performed by free hands,\nslave labor becomes less productive; and the slave is then a useless\nor onerous possession, whom it is important to export to those Southern\nStates where the same competition is not to be feared. Thus the\nabolition of slavery does not set the slave free, but it merely\ntransfers him from one master to another, and from the North to the\nSouth.\n\nThe emancipated negroes, and those born after the abolition of slavery,\ndo not, indeed, migrate from the North to the South; but their situation\nwith regard to the Europeans is not unlike that of the aborigines of\nAmerica; they remain half civilized, and deprived of their rights in\nthe midst of a population which is far superior to them in wealth and in\nknowledge; where they are exposed to the tyranny of the laws *m and the\nintolerance of the people. On some accounts they are still more to be\npitied than the Indians, since they are haunted by the reminiscence of\nslavery, and they cannot claim possession of a single portion of the\nsoil: many of them perish miserably, *n and the rest congregate in the\ngreat towns, where they perform the meanest offices, and lead a wretched\nand precarious existence.\n\n[Footnote m: The States in which slavery is abolished usually do what\nthey can to render their territory disagreeable to the negroes as\na place of residence; and as a kind of emulation exists between the\ndifferent States in this respect, the unhappy blacks can only choose the\nleast of the evils which beset them.]\n\n[Footnote n: There is a very great difference between the mortality\nof the blacks and of the whites in the States in which slavery is\nabolished; from 1820 to 1831 only one out of forty-two individuals\nof the white population died in Philadelphia; but one negro out of\ntwenty-one individuals of the black population died in the same space of\ntime. The mortality is by no means so great amongst the negroes who are\nstill slaves. (See Emerson's \"Medical Statistics,\" p. 28.)]\n\nBut even if the number of negroes continued to increase as rapidly as\nwhen they were still in a state of slavery, as the number of whites\naugments with twofold rapidity since the abolition of slavery, the\nblacks would soon be, as it were, lost in the midst of a strange\npopulation.\n\nA district which is cultivated by slaves is in general more scantily\npeopled than a district cultivated by free labor: moreover, America is\nstill a new country, and a State is therefore not half peopled at the\ntime when it abolishes slavery. No sooner is an end put to slavery than\nthe want of free labor is felt, and a crowd of enterprising adventurers\nimmediately arrive from all parts of the country, who hasten to profit\nby the fresh resources which are then opened to industry. The soil\nis soon divided amongst them, and a family of white settlers takes\npossession of each tract of country. Besides which, European emigration\nis exclusively directed to the free States; for what would be the\nfate of a poor emigrant who crosses the Atlantic in search of ease and\nhappiness if he were to land in a country where labor is stigmatized as\ndegrading?\n\nThus the white population grows by its natural increase, and at the same\ntime by the immense influx of emigrants; whilst the black population\nreceives no emigrants, and is upon its decline. The proportion which\nexisted between the two races is soon inverted. The negroes constitute a\nscanty remnant, a poor tribe of vagrants, which is lost in the midst of\nan immense people in full possession of the land; and the presence of\nthe blacks is only marked by the injustice and the hardships of which\nthey are the unhappy victims.\n\nIn several of the Western States the negro race never made its\nappearance, and in all the Northern States it is rapidly declining. Thus\nthe great question of its future condition is confined within a narrow\ncircle, where it becomes less formidable, though not more easy of\nsolution.\n\nThe more we descend towards the South, the more difficult does it become\nto abolish slavery with advantage: and this arises from several physical\ncauses which it is important to point out.\n\nThe first of these causes is the climate; it is well known that in\nproportion as Europeans approach the tropics they suffer more from\nlabor. Many of the Americans even assert that within a certain latitude\nthe exertions which a negro can make without danger are fatal to them;\n*o but I do not think that this opinion, which is so favorable to\nthe indolence of the inhabitants of southern regions, is confirmed by\nexperience. The southern parts of the Union are not hotter than the\nSouth of Italy and of Spain; *p and it may be asked why the European\ncannot work as well there as in the two latter countries. If slavery has\nbeen abolished in Italy and in Spain without causing the destruction of\nthe masters, why should not the same thing take place in the Union? I\ncannot believe that nature has prohibited the Europeans in Georgia and\nthe Floridas, under pain of death, from raising the means of subsistence\nfrom the soil, but their labor would unquestionably be more irksome and\nless productive to them than to the inhabitants of New England. As the\nfree workman thus loses a portion of his superiority over the slave in\nthe Southern States, there are fewer inducements to abolish slavery.\n\n[Footnote o: This is true of the spots in which rice is cultivated;\nrice-grounds, which are unwholesome in all countries, are particularly\ndangerous in those regions which are exposed to the beams of a tropical\nsun. Europeans would not find it easy to cultivate the soil in that part\nof the New World if it must be necessarily be made to produce rice; but\nmay they not subsist without rice-grounds?]\n\n[Footnote p: These States are nearer to the equator than Italy and\nSpain, but the temperature of the continent of America is very much\nlower than that of Europe.\n\nThe Spanish Government formerly caused a certain number of peasants\nfrom the Acores to be transported into a district of Louisiana called\nAttakapas, by way of experiment. These settlers still cultivate the soil\nwithout the assistance of slaves, but their industry is so languid as\nscarcely to supply their most necessary wants.]\n\nAll the plants of Europe grow in the northern parts of the Union; the\nSouth has special productions of its own. It has been observed that\nslave labor is a very expensive method of cultivating corn. The farmer\nof corn land in a country where slavery is unknown habitually retains a\nsmall number of laborers in his service, and at seed-time and harvest\nhe hires several additional hands, who only live at his cost for a short\nperiod. But the agriculturist in a slave State is obliged to keep a\nlarge number of slaves the whole year round, in order to sow his fields\nand to gather in his crops, although their services are only required\nfor a few weeks; but slaves are unable to wait till they are hired, and\nto subsist by their own labor in the mean time like free laborers; in\norder to have their services they must be bought. Slavery, independently\nof its general disadvantages, is therefore still more inapplicable to\ncountries in which corn is cultivated than to those which produce\ncrops of a different kind. The cultivation of tobacco, of cotton, and\nespecially of the sugar-cane, demands, on the other hand, unremitting\nattention: and women and children are employed in it, whose services are\nof but little use in the cultivation of wheat. Thus slavery is naturally\nmore fitted to the countries from which these productions are derived.\nTobacco, cotton, and the sugar-cane are exclusively grown in the South,\nand they form one of the principal sources of the wealth of those\nStates. If slavery were abolished, the inhabitants of the South would\nbe constrained to adopt one of two alternatives: they must either change\ntheir system of cultivation, and then they would come into competition\nwith the more active and more experienced inhabitants of the North; or,\nif they continued to cultivate the same produce without slave labor,\nthey would have to support the competition of the other States of the\nSouth, which might still retain their slaves. Thus, peculiar reasons\nfor maintaining slavery exist in the South which do not operate in the\nNorth.\n\nBut there is yet another motive which is more cogent than all the\nothers: the South might indeed, rigorously speaking, abolish slavery;\nbut how should it rid its territory of the black population? Slaves\nand slavery are driven from the North by the same law, but this twofold\nresult cannot be hoped for in the South.\n\nThe arguments which I have adduced to show that slavery is more natural\nand more advantageous in the South than in the North, sufficiently prove\nthat the number of slaves must be far greater in the former districts.\nIt was to the southern settlements that the first Africans were brought,\nand it is there that the greatest number of them have always been\nimported. As we advance towards the South, the prejudice which sanctions\nidleness increases in power. In the States nearest to the tropics there\nis not a single white laborer; the negroes are consequently much\nmore numerous in the South than in the North. And, as I have already\nobserved, this disproportion increases daily, since the negroes are\ntransferred to one part of the Union as soon as slavery is abolished in\nthe other. Thus the black population augments in the South, not only by\nits natural fecundity, but by the compulsory emigration of the negroes\nfrom the North; and the African race has causes of increase in the South\nvery analogous to those which so powerfully accelerate the growth of the\nEuropean race in the North.\n\nIn the State of Maine there is one negro in 300 inhabitants; in\nMassachusetts, one in 100; in New York, two in 100; in Pennsylvania,\nthree in the same number; in Maryland, thirty-four; in Virginia,\nforty-two; and lastly, in South Carolina *q fifty-five per cent. Such\nwas the proportion of the black population to the whites in the year\n1830. But this proportion is perpetually changing, as it constantly\ndecreases in the North and augments in the South.\n\n\n[Footnote q: We find it asserted in an American work, entitled \"Letters\non the Colonization Society,\" by Mr. Carey, 1833, \"That for the last\nforty years the black race has increased more rapidly than the white\nrace in the State of South Carolina; and that if we take the average\npopulation of the five States of the South into which slaves were first\nintroduced, viz., Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina,\nand Georgia, we shall find that from 1790 to 1830 the whites have\naugmented in the proportion of 80 to 100, and the blacks in that of 112\nto 100.\"\n\nIn the United States, in 1830, the population of the two races stood as\nfollows:--\n\nStates where slavery is abolished, 6,565,434 whites; 120,520 blacks.\nSlave States, 3,960,814 whites; 2,208,102 blacks. [In 1890 the United\nStates contained a population of 54,983,890 whites, and 7,638,360\nnegroes.]]\n\nIt is evident that the most Southern States of the Union cannot abolish\nslavery without incurring very great dangers, which the North had no\nreason to apprehend when it emancipated its black population. We\nhave already shown the system by which the Northern States secure the\ntransition from slavery to freedom, by keeping the present generation\nin chains, and setting their descendants free; by this means the negroes\nare gradually introduced into society; and whilst the men who might\nabuse their freedom are kept in a state of servitude, those who are\nemancipated may learn the art of being free before they become their own\nmasters. But it would be difficult to apply this method in the South. To\ndeclare that all the negroes born after a certain period shall be free,\nis to introduce the principle and the notion of liberty into the heart\nof slavery; the blacks whom the law thus maintains in a state of slavery\nfrom which their children are delivered, are astonished at so unequal a\nfate, and their astonishment is only the prelude to their impatience\nand irritation. Thenceforward slavery loses, in their eyes, that kind\nof moral power which it derived from time and habit; it is reduced to\na mere palpable abuse of force. The Northern States had nothing to fear\nfrom the contrast, because in them the blacks were few in number, and\nthe white population was very considerable. But if this faint dawn\nof freedom were to show two millions of men their true position, the\noppressors would have reason to tremble. After having affranchised the\nchildren of their slaves the Europeans of the Southern States would\nvery shortly be obliged to extend the same benefit to the whole black\npopulation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part V\n\nIn the North, as I have already remarked, a twofold migration ensues\nupon the abolition of slavery, or even precedes that event when\ncircumstances have rendered it probable; the slaves quit the country\nto be transported southwards; and the whites of the Northern States, as\nwell as the emigrants from Europe, hasten to fill up their place. But\nthese two causes cannot operate in the same manner in the Southern\nStates. On the one hand, the mass of slaves is too great for any\nexpectation of their ever being removed from the country to be\nentertained; and on the other hand, the Europeans and Anglo-Americans of\nthe North are afraid to come to inhabit a country in which labor has not\nyet been reinstated in its rightful honors. Besides, they very justly\nlook upon the States in which the proportion of the negroes equals or\nexceeds that of the whites, as exposed to very great dangers; and they\nrefrain from turning their activity in that direction.\n\nThus the inhabitants of the South would not be able, like their Northern\ncountrymen, to initiate the slaves gradually into a state of freedom by\nabolishing slavery; they have no means of perceptibly diminishing the\nblack population, and they would remain unsupported to repress its\nexcesses. So that in the course of a few years, a great people of free\nnegroes would exist in the heart of a white nation of equal size.\n\nThe same abuses of power which still maintain slavery, would then become\nthe source of the most alarming perils which the white population of the\nSouth might have to apprehend. At the present time the descendants of\nthe Europeans are the sole owners of the land; the absolute masters of\nall labor; and the only persons who are possessed of wealth, knowledge,\nand arms. The black is destitute of all these advantages, but he\nsubsists without them because he is a slave. If he were free, and\nobliged to provide for his own subsistence, would it be possible for\nhim to remain without these things and to support life? Or would not the\nvery instruments of the present superiority of the white, whilst slavery\nexists, expose him to a thousand dangers if it were abolished?\n\nAs long as the negro remains a slave, he may be kept in a condition\nnot very far removed from that of the brutes; but, with his liberty,\nhe cannot but acquire a degree of instruction which will enable him to\nappreciate his misfortunes, and to discern a remedy for them. Moreover,\nthere exists a singular principle of relative justice which is very\nfirmly implanted in the human heart. Men are much more forcibly struck\nby those inequalities which exist within the circle of the same class,\nthan with those which may be remarked between different classes. It is\nmore easy for them to admit slavery, than to allow several millions\nof citizens to exist under a load of eternal infamy and hereditary\nwretchedness. In the North the population of freed negroes feels these\nhardships and resents these indignities; but its numbers and its powers\nare small, whilst in the South it would be numerous and strong.\n\nAs soon as it is admitted that the whites and the emancipated blacks\nare placed upon the same territory in the situation of two alien\ncommunities, it will readily be understood that there are but two\nalternatives for the future; the negroes and the whites must either\nwholly part or wholly mingle. I have already expressed the conviction\nwhich I entertain as to the latter event. *r I do not imagine that\nthe white and black races will ever live in any country upon an equal\nfooting. But I believe the difficulty to be still greater in the\nUnited States than elsewhere. An isolated individual may surmount the\nprejudices of religion, of his country, or of his race, and if this\nindividual is a king he may effect surprising changes in society; but a\nwhole people cannot rise, as it were, above itself. A despot who should\nsubject the Americans and their former slaves to the same yoke, might\nperhaps succeed in commingling their races; but as long as the American\ndemocracy remains at the head of affairs, no one will undertake so\ndifficult a task; and it may be foreseen that the freer the white\npopulation of the United States becomes, the more isolated will it\nremain. *s\n\n[Footnote r: This opinion is sanctioned by authorities infinitely\nweightier than anything that I can say: thus, for instance, it is stated\nin the \"Memoirs of Jefferson\" (as collected by M. Conseil), \"Nothing is\nmore clearly written in the book of destiny than the emancipation of the\nblacks; and it is equally certain that the two races will never live in\na state of equal freedom under the same government, so insurmountable\nare the barriers which nature, habit, and opinions have established\nbetween them.\"]\n\n[Footnote s: If the British West India planters had governed themselves,\nthey would assuredly not have passed the Slave Emancipation Bill which\nthe mother-country has recently imposed upon them.]\n\nI have previously observed that the mixed race is the true bond of union\nbetween the Europeans and the Indians; just so the mulattoes are the\ntrue means of transition between the white and the negro; so that\nwherever mulattoes abound, the intermixture of the two races is not\nimpossible. In some parts of America, the European and the negro races\nare so crossed by one another, that it is rare to meet with a man who is\nentirely black, or entirely white: when they are arrived at this point,\nthe two races may really be said to be combined; or rather to have been\nabsorbed in a third race, which is connected with both without being\nidentical with either.\n\nOf all the Europeans the English are those who have mixed least with the\nnegroes. More mulattoes are to be seen in the South of the Union than in\nthe North, but still they are infinitely more scarce than in any other\nEuropean colony: mulattoes are by no means numerous in the United\nStates; they have no force peculiar to themselves, and when quarrels\noriginating in differences of color take place, they generally side\nwith the whites; just as the lackeys of the great, in Europe, assume the\ncontemptuous airs of nobility to the lower orders.\n\nThe pride of origin, which is natural to the English, is singularly\naugmented by the personal pride which democratic liberty fosters amongst\nthe Americans: the white citizen of the United States is proud of his\nrace, and proud of himself. But if the whites and the negroes do not\nintermingle in the North of the Union, how should they mix in the South?\nCan it be supposed for an instant, that an American of the Southern\nStates, placed, as he must forever be, between the white man with all\nhis physical and moral superiority and the negro, will ever think of\npreferring the latter? The Americans of the Southern States have two\npowerful passions which will always keep them aloof; the first is the\nfear of being assimilated to the negroes, their former slaves; and the\nsecond the dread of sinking below the whites, their neighbors.\n\nIf I were called upon to predict what will probably occur at some future\ntime, I should say, that the abolition of slavery in the South will,\nin the common course of things, increase the repugnance of the white\npopulation for the men of color. I found this opinion upon the analogous\nobservation which I already had occasion to make in the North. I there\nremarked that the white inhabitants of the North avoid the negroes with\nincreasing care, in proportion as the legal barriers of separation are\nremoved by the legislature; and why should not the same result\ntake place in the South? In the North, the whites are deterred from\nintermingling with the blacks by the fear of an imaginary danger; in the\nSouth, where the danger would be real, I cannot imagine that the fear\nwould be less general.\n\nIf, on the one hand, it be admitted (and the fact is unquestionable)\nthat the colored population perpetually accumulates in the extreme\nSouth, and that it increases more rapidly than that of the whites; and\nif, on the other hand, it be allowed that it is impossible to foresee\na time at which the whites and the blacks will be so intermingled as to\nderive the same benefits from society; must it not be inferred that the\nblacks and the whites will, sooner or later, come to open strife in the\nSouthern States of the Union? But if it be asked what the issue of the\nstruggle is likely to be, it will readily be understood that we are\nhere left to form a very vague surmise of the truth. The human mind may\nsucceed in tracing a wide circle, as it were, which includes the course\nof future events; but within that circle a thousand various chances\nand circumstances may direct it in as many different ways; and in\nevery picture of the future there is a dim spot, which the eye of the\nunderstanding cannot penetrate. It appears, however, to be extremely\nprobable that in the West Indian Islands the white race is destined to\nbe subdued, and the black population to share the same fate upon the\ncontinent.\n\nIn the West India Islands the white planters are surrounded by an\nimmense black population; on the continent, the blacks are placed\nbetween the ocean and an innumerable people, which already extends over\nthem in a dense mass, from the icy confines of Canada to the frontiers\nof Virginia, and from the banks of the Missouri to the shores of the\nAtlantic. If the white citizens of North America remain united, it\ncannot be supposed that the negroes will escape the destruction with\nwhich they are menaced; they must be subdued by want or by the sword.\nBut the black population which is accumulated along the coast of\nthe Gulf of Mexico, has a chance of success if the American Union is\ndissolved when the struggle between the two races begins. If the federal\ntie were broken, the citizens of the South would be wrong to rely upon\nany lasting succor from their Northern countrymen. The latter are\nwell aware that the danger can never reach them; and unless they are\nconstrained to march to the assistance of the South by a positive\nobligation, it may be foreseen that the sympathy of color will be\ninsufficient to stimulate their exertions.\n\nYet, at whatever period the strife may break out, the whites of the\nSouth, even if they are abandoned to their own resources, will enter\nthe lists with an immense superiority of knowledge and of the means of\nwarfare; but the blacks will have numerical strength and the energy of\ndespair upon their side, and these are powerful resources to men who\nhave taken up arms. The fate of the white population of the Southern\nStates will, perhaps, be similar to that of the Moors in Spain. After\nhaving occupied the land for centuries, it will perhaps be forced to\nretire to the country whence its ancestors came, and to abandon to the\nnegroes the possession of a territory, which Providence seems to have\nmore peculiarly destined for them, since they can subsist and labor in\nit more easily that the whites.\n\nThe danger of a conflict between the white and the black inhabitants of\nthe Southern States of the Union--a danger which, however remote it may\nbe, is inevitable--perpetually haunts the imagination of the Americans.\nThe inhabitants of the North make it a common topic of conversation,\nalthough they have no direct injury to fear from the struggle; but they\nvainly endeavor to devise some means of obviating the misfortunes which\nthey foresee. In the Southern States the subject is not discussed: the\nplanter does not allude to the future in conversing with strangers; the\ncitizen does not communicate his apprehensions to his friends; he seeks\nto conceal them from himself; but there is something more alarming in\nthe tacit forebodings of the South, than in the clamorous fears of the\nNorthern States.\n\nThis all-pervading disquietude has given birth to an undertaking which\nis but little known, but which may have the effect of changing the fate\nof a portion of the human race. From apprehension of the dangers which\nI have just been describing, a certain number of American citizens have\nformed a society for the purpose of exporting to the coast of Guinea,\nat their own expense, such free negroes as may be willing to escape from\nthe oppression to which they are subject. *t In 1820, the society to\nwhich I allude formed a settlement in Africa, upon the seventh degree\nof north latitude, which bears the name of Liberia. The most recent\nintelligence informs us that 2,500 negroes are collected there; they\nhave introduced the democratic institutions of America into the country\nof their forefathers; and Liberia has a representative system of\ngovernment, negro jurymen, negro magistrates, and negro priests;\nchurches have been built, newspapers established, and, by a singular\nchange in the vicissitudes of the world, white men are prohibited from\nsojourning within the settlement. *u\n\n[Footnote t: This society assumed the name of \"The Society for\nthe Colonization of the Blacks.\" See its annual reports; and more\nparticularly the fifteenth. See also the pamphlet, to which allusion has\nalready been made, entitled \"Letters on the Colonization Society, and on\nits probable Results,\" by Mr. Carey, Philadelphia, 1833.]\n\n[Footnote u: This last regulation was laid down by the founders of\nthe settlement; they apprehended that a state of things might arise\nin Africa similar to that which exists on the frontiers of the United\nStates, and that if the negroes, like the Indians, were brought into\ncollision with a people more enlightened than themselves, they would be\ndestroyed before they could be civilized.]\n\nThis is indeed a strange caprice of fortune. Two hundred years have now\nelapsed since the inhabitants of Europe undertook to tear the negro\nfrom his family and his home, in order to transport him to the shores of\nNorth America; at the present day, the European settlers are engaged in\nsending back the descendants of those very negroes to the Continent from\nwhich they were originally taken; and the barbarous Africans have been\nbrought into contact with civilization in the midst of bondage, and have\nbecome acquainted with free political institutions in slavery. Up to the\npresent time Africa has been closed against the arts and sciences of the\nwhites; but the inventions of Europe will perhaps penetrate into those\nregions, now that they are introduced by Africans themselves. The\nsettlement of Liberia is founded upon a lofty and a most fruitful idea;\nbut whatever may be its results with regard to the Continent of Africa,\nit can afford no remedy to the New World.\n\nIn twelve years the Colonization Society has transported 2,500 negroes\nto Africa; in the same space of time about 700,000 blacks were born in\nthe United States. If the colony of Liberia were so situated as to be\nable to receive thousands of new inhabitants every year, and if the\nnegroes were in a state to be sent thither with advantage; if the Union\nwere to supply the society with annual subsidies, *v and to transport\nthe negroes to Africa in the vessels of the State, it would still be\nunable to counterpoise the natural increase of population amongst the\nblacks; and as it could not remove as many men in a year as are born\nupon its territory within the same space of time, it would fail in\nsuspending the growth of the evil which is daily increasing in the\nStates. *w The negro race will never leave those shores of the American\ncontinent, to which it was brought by the passions and the vices of\nEuropeans; and it will not disappear from the New World as long as it\ncontinues to exist. The inhabitants of the United States may retard\nthe calamities which they apprehend, but they cannot now destroy their\nefficient cause.\n\n[Footnote v: Nor would these be the only difficulties attendant upon\nthe undertaking; if the Union undertook to buy up the negroes now in\nAmerica, in order to transport them to Africa, the price of slaves,\nincreasing with their scarcity, would soon become enormous; and the\nStates of the North would never consent to expend such great sums for a\npurpose which would procure such small advantages to themselves. If the\nUnion took possession of the slaves in the Southern States by force, or\nat a rate determined by law, an insurmountable resistance would arise in\nthat part of the country. Both alternatives are equally impossible.]\n\n[Footnote w: In 1830 there were in the United States 2,010,327 slaves\nand 319,439 free blacks, in all 2,329,766 negroes: which formed about\none-fifth of the total population of the United States at that time.]\n\nI am obliged to confess that I do not regard the abolition of slavery\nas a means of warding off the struggle of the two races in the United\nStates. The negroes may long remain slaves without complaining; but if\nthey are once raised to the level of free men, they will soon revolt at\nbeing deprived of all their civil rights; and as they cannot become the\nequals of the whites, they will speedily declare themselves as enemies.\nIn the North everything contributed to facilitate the emancipation of\nthe slaves; and slavery was abolished, without placing the free negroes\nin a position which could become formidable, since their number was too\nsmall for them ever to claim the exercise of their rights. But such is\nnot the case in the South. The question of slavery was a question of\ncommerce and manufacture for the slave-owners in the North; for those of\nthe South, it is a question of life and death. God forbid that I should\nseek to justify the principle of negro slavery, as has been done by\nsome American writers! But I only observe that all the countries which\nformerly adopted that execrable principle are not equally able to\nabandon it at the present time.\n\nWhen I contemplate the condition of the South, I can only discover two\nalternatives which may be adopted by the white inhabitants of those\nStates; viz., either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle\nwith them; or, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of\nslavery as long as possible. All intermediate measures seem to me likely\nto terminate, and that shortly, in the most horrible of civil wars, and\nperhaps in the extirpation of one or other of the two races. Such is the\nview which the Americans of the South take of the question, and they\nact consistently with it. As they are determined not to mingle with the\nnegroes, they refuse to emancipate them.\n\n\nNot that the inhabitants of the South regard slavery as necessary to the\nwealth of the planter, for on this point many of them agree with their\nNorthern countrymen in freely admitting that slavery is prejudicial to\ntheir interest; but they are convinced that, however prejudicial it may\nbe, they hold their lives upon no other tenure. The instruction which is\nnow diffused in the South has convinced the inhabitants that slavery is\ninjurious to the slave-owner, but it has also shown them, more clearly\nthan before, that no means exist of getting rid of its bad consequences.\nHence arises a singular contrast; the more the utility of slavery is\ncontested, the more firmly is it established in the laws; and whilst\nthe principle of servitude is gradually abolished in the North, that\nself-same principle gives rise to more and more rigorous consequences in\nthe South.\n\nThe legislation of the Southern States with regard to slaves, presents\nat the present day such unparalleled atrocities as suffice to show how\nradically the laws of humanity have been perverted, and to betray the\ndesperate position of the community in which that legislation has\nbeen promulgated. The Americans of this portion of the Union have not,\nindeed, augmented the hardships of slavery; they have, on the contrary,\nbettered the physical condition of the slaves. The only means by which\nthe ancients maintained slavery were fetters and death; the Americans of\nthe South of the Union have discovered more intellectual securities\nfor the duration of their power. They have employed their despotism and\ntheir violence against the human mind. In antiquity, precautions were\ntaken to prevent the slave from breaking his chains; at the present day\nmeasures are adopted to deprive him even of the desire of freedom. The\nancients kept the bodies of their slaves in bondage, but they placed\nno restraint upon the mind and no check upon education; and they\nacted consistently with their established principle, since a natural\ntermination of slavery then existed, and one day or other the slave\nmight be set free, and become the equal of his master. But the Americans\nof the South, who do not admit that the negroes can ever be commingled\nwith themselves, have forbidden them to be taught to read or to write,\nunder severe penalties; and as they will not raise them to their own\nlevel, they sink them as nearly as possible to that of the brutes.\n\nThe hope of liberty had always been allowed to the slave to cheer the\nhardships of his condition. But the Americans of the South are well\naware that emancipation cannot but be dangerous, when the freed man can\nnever be assimilated to his former master. To give a man his freedom,\nand to leave him in wretchedness and ignominy, is nothing less than to\nprepare a future chief for a revolt of the slaves. Moreover, it has long\nbeen remarked that the presence of a free negro vaguely agitates the\nminds of his less fortunate brethren, and conveys to them a dim notion\nof their rights. The Americans of the South have consequently taken\nmeasures to prevent slave-owners from emancipating their slaves in most\ncases; not indeed by a positive prohibition, but by subjecting that step\nto various forms which it is difficult to comply with. I happened\nto meet with an old man, in the South of the Union, who had lived in\nillicit intercourse with one of his negresses, and had had several\nchildren by her, who were born the slaves of their father. He had indeed\nfrequently thought of bequeathing to them at least their liberty; but\nyears had elapsed without his being able to surmount the legal obstacles\nto their emancipation, and in the mean while his old age was come, and\nhe was about to die. He pictured to himself his sons dragged from market\nto market, and passing from the authority of a parent to the rod of\nthe stranger, until these horrid anticipations worked his expiring\nimagination into frenzy. When I saw him he was a prey to all the anguish\nof despair, and he made me feel how awful is the retribution of nature\nupon those who have broken her laws.\n\nThese evils are unquestionably great; but they are the necessary and\nforeseen consequence of the very principle of modern slavery. When the\nEuropeans chose their slaves from a race differing from their own, which\nmany of them considered as inferior to the other races of mankind,\nand which they all repelled with horror from any notion of intimate\nconnection, they must have believed that slavery would last forever;\nsince there is no intermediate state which can be durable between the\nexcessive inequality produced by servitude and the complete equality\nwhich originates in independence. The Europeans did imperfectly feel\nthis truth, but without acknowledging it even to themselves. Whenever\nthey have had to do with negroes, their conduct has either been dictated\nby their interest and their pride, or by their compassion. They first\nviolated every right of humanity by their treatment of the negro\nand they afterwards informed him that those rights were precious and\ninviolable. They affected to open their ranks to the slaves, but the\nnegroes who attempted to penetrate into the community were driven back\nwith scorn; and they have incautiously and involuntarily been led to\nadmit of freedom instead of slavery, without having the courage to be\nwholly iniquitous, or wholly just.\n\nIf it be impossible to anticipate a period at which the Americans of the\nSouth will mingle their blood with that of the negroes, can they allow\ntheir slaves to become free without compromising their own security? And\nif they are obliged to keep that race in bondage in order to save their\nown families, may they not be excused for availing themselves of the\nmeans best adapted to that end? The events which are taking place in\nthe Southern States of the Union appear to me to be at once the most\nhorrible and the most natural results of slavery. When I see the order\nof nature overthrown, and when I hear the cry of humanity in its vain\nstruggle against the laws, my indignation does not light upon the men of\nour own time who are the instruments of these outrages; but I reserve\nmy execration for those who, after a thousand years of freedom, brought\nback slavery into the world once more.\n\nWhatever may be the efforts of the Americans of the South to maintain\nslavery, they will not always succeed. Slavery, which is now confined to\na single tract of the civilized earth, which is attacked by Christianity\nas unjust, and by political economy as prejudicial; and which is now\ncontrasted with democratic liberties and the information of our age,\ncannot survive. By the choice of the master, or by the will of the\nslave, it will cease; and in either case great calamities may be\nexpected to ensue. If liberty be refused to the negroes of the South,\nthey will in the end seize it for themselves by force; if it be given,\nthey will abuse it ere long. *x\n\n[Footnote x: [This chapter is no longer applicable to the condition of\nthe negro race in the United States, since the abolition of slavery\nwas the result, though not the object, of the great Civil War, and the\nnegroes have been raised to the condition not only of freedmen, but of\ncitizens; and in some States they exercise a preponderating political\npower by reason of their numerical majority. Thus, in South Carolina\nthere were in 1870, 289,667 whites and 415,814 blacks. But the\nemancipation of the slaves has not solved the problem, how two races so\ndifferent and so hostile are to live together in peace in one country on\nequal terms. That problem is as difficult, perhaps more difficult than\never; and to this difficulty the author's remarks are still perfectly\napplicable.]]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part VI\n\nWhat Are The Chances In Favor Of The Duration Of The American Union, And\nWhat Dangers Threaten It *y\n\n[Footnote y: [This chapter is one of the most curious and interesting\nportions of the work, because it embraces almost all the constitutional\nand social questions which were raised by the great secession of the\nSouth and decided by the results of the Civil War. But it must be\nconfessed that the sagacity of the author is sometimes at fault in these\nspeculations, and did not save him from considerable errors, which the\ncourse of events has since made apparent. He held that \"the legislators\nof the Constitution of 1789 were not appointed to constitute the\ngovernment of a single people, but to regulate the association of\nseveral States; that the Union was formed by the voluntary agreement\nof the States, and in uniting together they have not forfeited their\nnationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the\nsame people.\" Whence he inferred that \"if one of the States chose to\nwithdraw its name from the contract, it would be difficult to disprove\nits right of doing so; and that the Federal Government would have no\nmeans of maintaining its claims directly, either by force or by right.\"\nThis is the Southern theory of the Constitution, and the whole case of\nthe South in favor of secession. To many Europeans, and to some\nAmerican (Northern) jurists, this view appeared to be sound; but it was\nvigorously resisted by the North, and crushed by force of arms.\n\nThe author of this book was mistaken in supposing that the \"Union was a\nvast body which presents no definite object to patriotic feeling.\" When\nthe day of trial came, millions of men were ready to lay down their\nlives for it. He was also mistaken in supposing that the Federal\nExecutive is so weak that it requires the free consent of the governed\nto enable it to subsist, and that it would be defeated in a struggle\nto maintain the Union against one or more separate States. In 1861 nine\nStates, with a population of 8,753,000, seceded, and maintained for four\nyears a resolute but unequal contest for independence, but they were\ndefeated.\n\nLastly, the author was mistaken in supposing that a community of\ninterests would always prevail between North and South sufficiently\npowerful to bind them together. He overlooked the influence which the\nquestion of slavery must have on the Union the moment that the majority\nof the people of the North declared against it. In 1831, when the author\nvisited America, the anti-slavery agitation had scarcely begun; and the\nfact of Southern slavery was accepted by men of all parties, even in the\nStates where there were no slaves: and that was unquestionably the view\ntaken by all the States and by all American statesmen at the time of the\nadoption of the Constitution, in 1789. But in the course of thirty years\na great change took place, and the North refused to perpetuate what had\nbecome the \"peculiar institution\" of the South, especially as it gave\nthe South a species of aristocratic preponderance. The result was the\nratification, in December, 1865, of the celebrated 13th article or\namendment of the Constitution, which declared that \"neither slavery nor\ninvoluntary servitude--except as a punishment for crime--shall exist\nwithin the United States.\" To which was soon afterwards added the 15th\narticle, \"The right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged\nby the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color, or\nprevious servitude.\" The emancipation of several millions of negro\nslaves without compensation, and the transfer to them of political\npreponderance in the States in which they outnumber the white\npopulation, were acts of the North totally opposed to the interests\nof the South, and which could only have been carried into effect by\nconquest.--Translator's Note.]]\n\nReason for which the preponderating force lies in the States rather than\nin the Union--The Union will only last as long as all the States choose\nto belong to it--Causes which tend to keep them united--Utility of\nthe Union to resist foreign enemies, and to prevent the existence\nof foreigners in America--No natural barriers between the several\nStates--No conflicting interests to divide them--Reciprocal interests\nof the Northern, Southern, and Western States--Intellectual ties of\nunion--Uniformity of opinions--Dangers of the Union resulting from the\ndifferent characters and the passions of its citizens--Character of the\ncitizens in the South and in the North--The rapid growth of the\nUnion one of its greatest dangers--Progress of the population to the\nNorthwest--Power gravitates in the same direction--Passions originating\nfrom sudden turns of fortune--Whether the existing Government of the\nUnion tends to gain strength, or to lose it--Various signs of its\ndecrease--Internal improvements--Waste lands--Indians--The Bank--The\nTariff--General Jackson.\n\nThe maintenance of the existing institutions of the several States\ndepends in some measure upon the maintenance of the Union itself. It is\ntherefore important in the first instance to inquire into the probable\nfate of the Union. One point may indeed be assumed at once: if\nthe present confederation were dissolved, it appears to me to be\nincontestable that the States of which it is now composed would not\nreturn to their original isolated condition, but that several unions\nwould then be formed in the place of one. It is not my intention to\ninquire into the principles upon which these new unions would probably\nbe established, but merely to show what the causes are which may effect\nthe dismemberment of the existing confederation.\n\nWith this object I shall be obliged to retrace some of the steps which\nI have already taken, and to revert to topics which I have before\ndiscussed. I am aware that the reader may accuse me of repetition, but\nthe importance of the matter which still remains to be treated is my\nexcuse; I had rather say too much, than say too little to be thoroughly\nunderstood, and I prefer injuring the author to slighting the subject.\n\nThe legislators who formed the Constitution of 1789 endeavored to confer\na distinct and preponderating authority upon the federal power. But they\nwere confined by the conditions of the task which they had undertaken\nto perform. They were not appointed to constitute the government of a\nsingle people, but to regulate the association of several States; and,\nwhatever their inclinations might be, they could not but divide the\nexercise of sovereignty in the end.\n\nIn order to understand the consequences of this division, it is\nnecessary to make a short distinction between the affairs of the\nGovernment. There are some objects which are national by their very\nnature, that is to say, which affect the nation as a body, and can\nonly be intrusted to the man or the assembly of men who most completely\nrepresent the entire nation. Amongst these may be reckoned war and\ndiplomacy. There are other objects which are provincial by their very\nnature, that is to say, which only affect certain localities, and which\ncan only be properly treated in that locality. Such, for instance, is\nthe budget of a municipality. Lastly, there are certain objects of\na mixed nature, which are national inasmuch as they affect all the\ncitizens who compose the nation, and which are provincial inasmuch as\nit is not necessary that the nation itself should provide for them all.\nSuch are the rights which regulate the civil and political condition of\nthe citizens. No society can exist without civil and political rights.\nThese rights therefore interest all the citizens alike; but it is not\nalways necessary to the existence and the prosperity of the nation that\nthese rights should be uniform, nor, consequently, that they should be\nregulated by the central authority.\n\nThere are, then, two distinct categories of objects which are submitted\nto the direction of the sovereign power; and these categories occur in\nall well-constituted communities, whatever the basis of the political\nconstitution may otherwise be. Between these two extremes the objects\nwhich I have termed mixed may be considered to lie. As these objects\nare neither exclusively national nor entirely provincial, they may be\nobtained by a national or by a provincial government, according to the\nagreement of the contracting parties, without in any way impairing the\ncontract of association.\n\nThe sovereign power is usually formed by the union of separate\nindividuals, who compose a people; and individual powers or collective\nforces, each representing a very small portion of the sovereign\nauthority, are the sole elements which are subjected to the general\nGovernment of their choice. In this case the general Government is more\nnaturally called upon to regulate, not only those affairs which are\nof essential national importance, but those which are of a more local\ninterest; and the local governments are reduced to that small share of\nsovereign authority which is indispensable to their prosperity.\n\nBut sometimes the sovereign authority is composed of preorganized\npolitical bodies, by virtue of circumstances anterior to their union;\nand in this case the provincial governments assume the control, not only\nof those affairs which more peculiarly belong to their province, but of\nall, or of a part of the mixed affairs to which allusion has been made.\nFor the confederate nations which were independent sovereign States\nbefore their union, and which still represent a very considerable share\nof the sovereign power, have only consented to cede to the general\nGovernment the exercise of those rights which are indispensable to the\nUnion.\n\nWhen the national Government, independently of the prerogatives inherent\nin its nature, is invested with the right of regulating the affairs\nwhich relate partly to the general and partly to the local interests,\nit possesses a preponderating influence. Not only are its own rights\nextensive, but all the rights which it does not possess exist by its\nsufferance, and it may be apprehended that the provincial governments\nmay be deprived of their natural and necessary prerogatives by its\ninfluence.\n\nWhen, on the other hand, the provincial governments are invested\nwith the power of regulating those same affairs of mixed interest, an\nopposite tendency prevails in society. The preponderating force resides\nin the province, not in the nation; and it may be apprehended that the\nnational Government may in the end be stripped of the privileges which\nare necessary to its existence.\n\nIndependent nations have therefore a natural tendency to centralization,\nand confederations to dismemberment.\n\nIt now only remains for us to apply these general principles to the\nAmerican Union. The several States were necessarily possessed of the\nright of regulating all exclusively provincial affairs. Moreover these\nsame States retained the rights of determining the civil and political\ncompetency of the citizens, or regulating the reciprocal relations of\nthe members of the community, and of dispensing justice; rights which\nare of a general nature, but which do not necessarily appertain to the\nnational Government. We have shown that the Government of the Union is\ninvested with the power of acting in the name of the whole nation in\nthose cases in which the nation has to appear as a single and undivided\npower; as, for instance, in foreign relations, and in offering a common\nresistance to a common enemy; in short, in conducting those affairs\nwhich I have styled exclusively national.\n\nIn this division of the rights of sovereignty, the share of the Union\nseems at first sight to be more considerable than that of the States;\nbut a more attentive investigation shows it to be less so. The\nundertakings of the Government of the Union are more vast, but their\ninfluence is more rarely felt. Those of the provincial governments are\ncomparatively small, but they are incessant, and they serve to keep\nalive the authority which they represent. The Government of the Union\nwatches the general interests of the country; but the general interests\nof a people have a very questionable influence upon individual\nhappiness, whilst provincial interests produce a most immediate effect\nupon the welfare of the inhabitants. The Union secures the independence\nand the greatness of the nation, which do not immediately affect private\ncitizens; but the several States maintain the liberty, regulate the\nrights, protect the fortune, and secure the life and the whole future\nprosperity of every citizen.\n\nThe Federal Government is very far removed from its subjects, whilst the\nprovincial governments are within the reach of them all, and are ready\nto attend to the smallest appeal. The central Government has upon its\nside the passions of a few superior men who aspire to conduct it; but\nupon the side of the provincial governments are the interests of all\nthose second-rate individuals who can only hope to obtain power within\ntheir own State, and who nevertheless exercise the largest share of\nauthority over the people because they are placed nearest to its level.\nThe Americans have therefore much more to hope and to fear from the\nStates than from the Union; and, in conformity with the natural tendency\nof the human mind, they are more likely to attach themselves to the\nformer than to the latter. In this respect their habits and feelings\nharmonize with their interests.\n\n\nWhen a compact nation divides its sovereignty, and adopts a confederate\nform of government, the traditions, the customs, and the manners of the\npeople are for a long time at variance with their legislation; and the\nformer tend to give a degree of influence to the central government\nwhich the latter forbids. When a number of confederate states unite to\nform a single nation, the same causes operate in an opposite direction.\nI have no doubt that if France were to become a confederate republic\nlike that of the United States, the government would at first display\nmore energy than that of the Union; and if the Union were to alter\nits constitution to a monarchy like that of France, I think that the\nAmerican Government would be a long time in acquiring the force\nwhich now rules the latter nation. When the national existence of the\nAnglo-Americans began, their provincial existence was already of long\nstanding; necessary relations were established between the townships and\nthe individual citizens of the same States; and they were accustomed\nto consider some objects as common to them all, and to conduct other\naffairs as exclusively relating to their own special interests.\n\nThe Union is a vast body which presents no definite object to\npatriotic feeling. The forms and limits of the State are distinct and\ncircumscribed; since it represents a certain number of objects which are\nfamiliar to the citizens and beloved by all. It is identified with the\nvery soil, with the right of property and the domestic affections, with\nthe recollections of the past, the labors of the present, and the hopes\nof the future. Patriotism, then, which is frequently a mere extension of\nindividual egotism, is still directed to the State, and is not excited\nby the Union. Thus the tendency of the interests, the habits, and the\nfeelings of the people is to centre political activity in the States, in\npreference to the Union.\n\nIt is easy to estimate the different forces of the two governments, by\nremarking the manner in which they fulfil their respective functions.\nWhenever the government of a State has occasion to address an individual\nor an assembly of individuals, its language is clear and imperative; and\nsuch is also the tone of the Federal Government in its intercourse with\nindividuals, but no sooner has it anything to do with a State than it\nbegins to parley, to explain its motives and to justify its conduct, to\nargue, to advise, and, in short, anything but to command. If doubts are\nraised as to the limits of the constitutional powers of each government,\nthe provincial government prefers its claim with boldness, and takes\nprompt and energetic steps to support it. In the mean while the\nGovernment of the Union reasons; it appeals to the interests, to the\ngood sense, to the glory of the nation; it temporizes, it negotiates,\nand does not consent to act until it is reduced to the last extremity.\nAt first sight it might readily be imagined that it is the provincial\ngovernment which is armed with the authority of the nation, and that\nCongress represents a single State.\n\nThe Federal Government is, therefore, notwithstanding the precautions of\nthose who founded it, naturally so weak that it more peculiarly requires\nthe free consent of the governed to enable it to subsist. It is easy\nto perceive that its object is to enable the States to realize with\nfacility their determination of remaining united; and, as long as this\npreliminary condition exists, its authority is great, temperate, and\neffective. The Constitution fits the Government to control individuals,\nand easily to surmount such obstacles as they may be inclined to\noffer; but it was by no means established with a view to the possible\nseparation of one or more of the States from the Union.\n\nIf the sovereignty of the Union were to engage in a struggle with\nthat of the States at the present day, its defeat may be confidently\npredicted; and it is not probable that such a struggle would be\nseriously undertaken. As often as a steady resistance is offered to the\nFederal Government it will be found to yield. Experience has hitherto\nshown that whenever a State has demanded anything with perseverance\nand resolution, it has invariably succeeded; and that if a separate\ngovernment has distinctly refused to act, it was left to do as it\nthought fit. *z\n\n[Footnote z: See the conduct of the Northern States in the war of 1812.\n\"During that war,\" says Jefferson in a letter to General Lafayette,\n\"four of the Eastern States were only attached to the Union, like so\nmany inanimate bodies to living men.\"]\n\nBut even if the Government of the Union had any strength inherent in\nitself, the physical situation of the country would render the exercise\nof that strength very difficult. *a The United States cover an immense\nterritory; they are separated from each other by great distances; and\nthe population is disseminated over the surface of a country which is\nstill half a wilderness. If the Union were to undertake to enforce the\nallegiance of the confederate States by military means, it would be in\na position very analogous to that of England at the time of the War of\nIndependence.\n\n[Footnote a: The profound peace of the Union affords no pretext for a\nstanding army; and without a standing army a government is not prepared\nto profit by a favorable opportunity to conquer resistance, and take the\nsovereign power by surprise. [This note, and the paragraph in the text\nwhich precedes, have been shown by the results of the Civil War to be a\nmisconception of the writer.]]\n\nHowever strong a government may be, it cannot easily escape from the\nconsequences of a principle which it has once admitted as the foundation\nof its constitution. The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement\nof the States; and, in uniting together, they have not forfeited their\nnationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the\nsame people. If one of the States chose to withdraw its name from the\ncontract, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so; and\nthe Federal Government would have no means of maintaining its claims\ndirectly, either by force or by right. In order to enable the Federal\nGovernment easily to conquer the resistance which may be offered to it\nby any one of its subjects, it would be necessary that one or more of\nthem should be specially interested in the existence of the Union, as\nhas frequently been the case in the history of confederations.\n\nIf it be supposed that amongst the States which are united by the\nfederal tie there are some which exclusively enjoy the principal\nadvantages of union, or whose prosperity depends on the duration of that\nunion, it is unquestionable that they will always be ready to support\nthe central Government in enforcing the obedience of the others. But the\nGovernment would then be exerting a force not derived from itself, but\nfrom a principle contrary to its nature. States form confederations in\norder to derive equal advantages from their union; and in the case\njust alluded to, the Federal Government would derive its power from the\nunequal distribution of those benefits amongst the States.\n\nIf one of the confederate States have acquired a preponderance\nsufficiently great to enable it to take exclusive possession of\nthe central authority, it will consider the other States as subject\nprovinces, and it will cause its own supremacy to be respected under the\nborrowed name of the sovereignty of the Union. Great things may then\nbe done in the name of the Federal Government, but in reality that\nGovernment will have ceased to exist. *b In both these cases, the power\nwhich acts in the name of the confederation becomes stronger the more\nit abandons the natural state and the acknowledged principles of\nconfederations.\n\n[Footnote b: Thus the province of Holland in the republic of the Low\nCountries, and the Emperor in the Germanic Confederation, have sometimes\nput themselves in the place of the union, and have employed the federal\nauthority to their own advantage.]\n\nIn America the existing Union is advantageous to all the States, but it\nis not indispensable to any one of them. Several of them might break\nthe federal tie without compromising the welfare of the others, although\ntheir own prosperity would be lessened. As the existence and the\nhappiness of none of the States are wholly dependent on the present\nConstitution, they would none of them be disposed to make great personal\nsacrifices to maintain it. On the other hand, there is no State which\nseems hitherto to have its ambition much interested in the maintenance\nof the existing Union. They certainly do not all exercise the same\ninfluence in the federal councils, but no one of them can hope to\ndomineer over the rest, or to treat them as its inferiors or as its\nsubjects.\n\nIt appears to me unquestionable that if any portion of the Union\nseriously desired to separate itself from the other States, they would\nnot be able, nor indeed would they attempt, to prevent it; and that\nthe present Union will only last as long as the States which compose\nit choose to continue members of the confederation. If this point be\nadmitted, the question becomes less difficult; and our object is, not\nto inquire whether the States of the existing Union are capable of\nseparating, but whether they will choose to remain united.\n\nAmongst the various reasons which tend to render the existing Union\nuseful to the Americans, two principal causes are peculiarly evident to\nthe observer. Although the Americans are, as it were, alone upon their\ncontinent, their commerce makes them the neighbors of all the nations\nwith which they trade. Notwithstanding their apparent isolation, the\nAmericans require a certain degree of strength, which they cannot retain\notherwise than by remaining united to each other. If the States were to\nsplit, they would not only diminish the strength which they are now able\nto display towards foreign nations, but they would soon create foreign\npowers upon their own territory. A system of inland custom-houses would\nthen be established; the valleys would be divided by imaginary boundary\nlines; the courses of the rivers would be confined by territorial\ndistinctions; and a multitude of hindrances would prevent the Americans\nfrom exploring the whole of that vast continent which Providence has\nallotted to them for a dominion. At present they have no invasion to\nfear, and consequently no standing armies to maintain, no taxes to levy.\nIf the Union were dissolved, all these burdensome measures might ere\nlong be required. The Americans are then very powerfully interested\nin the maintenance of their Union. On the other hand, it is almost\nimpossible to discover any sort of material interest which might at\npresent tempt a portion of the Union to separate from the other States.\n\nWhen we cast our eyes upon the map of the United States, we perceive\nthe chain of the Alleghany Mountains, running from the northeast to the\nsouthwest, and crossing nearly one thousand miles of country; and we are\nled to imagine that the design of Providence was to raise between the\nvalley of the Mississippi and the coast of the Atlantic Ocean one of\nthose natural barriers which break the mutual intercourse of men, and\nform the necessary limits of different States. But the average height of\nthe Alleghanies does not exceed 2,500 feet; their greatest elevation is\nnot above 4,000 feet; their rounded summits, and the spacious valleys\nwhich they conceal within their passes, are of easy access from several\nsides. Besides which, the principal rivers which fall into the Atlantic\nOcean--the Hudson, the Susquehanna, and the Potomac--take their rise\nbeyond the Alleghanies, in an open district, which borders upon the\nvalley of the Mississippi. These streams quit this tract of country,\nmake their way through the barrier which would seem to turn them\nwestward, and as they wind through the mountains they open an easy and\nnatural passage to man. No natural barrier exists in the regions which\nare now inhabited by the Anglo-Americans; the Alleghanies are so far\nfrom serving as a boundary to separate nations, that they do not even\nserve as a frontier to the States. New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia\ncomprise them within their borders, and they extend as much to the\nwest as to the east of the line. The territory now occupied by the\ntwenty-four States of the Union, and the three great districts which\nhave not yet acquired the rank of States, although they already contain\ninhabitants, covers a surface of 1,002,600 square miles, *c which is\nabout equal to five times the extent of France. Within these limits the\nqualities of the soil, the temperature, and the produce of the country,\nare extremely various. The vast extent of territory occupied by the\nAnglo-American republics has given rise to doubts as to the maintenance\nof their Union. Here a distinction must be made; contrary interests\nsometimes arise in the different provinces of a vast empire, which often\nterminate in open dissensions; and the extent of the country is then\nmost prejudicial to the power of the State. But if the inhabitants of\nthese vast regions are not divided by contrary interests, the extent of\nthe territory may be favorable to their prosperity; for the unity of the\ngovernment promotes the interchange of the different productions of the\nsoil, and increases their value by facilitating their consumption.\n\n[Footnote c: See \"Darby's View of the United States,\" p. 435. [In 1890\nthe number of States and Territories had increased to 51, the population\nto 62,831,900, and the area of the States, 3,602,990 square miles.\nThis does not include the Philippine Islands, Hawaii, or Porto Rico.\nA conservative estimate of the population of the Philippine Islands is\n8,000,000; that of Hawaii, by the census of 1897, was given at 109,020;\nand the present estimated population of Porto Rico is 900,000. The area\nof the Philippine Islands is about 120,000 square miles, that of Hawaii\nis 6,740 square miles, and the area of Porto Rico is about 3,600 square\nmiles.]]\n\nIt is indeed easy to discover different interests in the different parts\nof the Union, but I am unacquainted with any which are hostile to each\nother. The Southern States are almost exclusively agricultural. The\nNorthern States are more peculiarly commercial and manufacturing. The\nStates of the West are at the same time agricultural and manufacturing.\nIn the South the crops consist of tobacco, of rice, of cotton, and\nof sugar; in the North and the West, of wheat and maize. These are\ndifferent sources of wealth; but union is the means by which these\nsources are opened to all, and rendered equally advantageous to the\nseveral districts.\n\nThe North, which ships the produce of the Anglo-Americans to all parts\nof the world, and brings back the produce of the globe to the Union,\nis evidently interested in maintaining the confederation in its present\ncondition, in order that the number of American producers and consumers\nmay remain as large as possible. The North is the most natural agent\nof communication between the South and the West of the Union on the one\nhand, and the rest of the world upon the other; the North is therefore\ninterested in the union and prosperity of the South and the West,\nin order that they may continue to furnish raw materials for its\nmanufactures, and cargoes for its shipping.\n\nThe South and the West, on their side, are still more directly\ninterested in the preservation of the Union, and the prosperity of the\nNorth. The produce of the South is, for the most part, exported\nbeyond seas; the South and the West consequently stand in need of the\ncommercial resources of the North. They are likewise interested in\nthe maintenance of a powerful fleet by the Union, to protect them\nefficaciously. The South and the West have no vessels, but they cannot\nrefuse a willing subsidy to defray the expenses of the navy; for if the\nfleets of Europe were to blockade the ports of the South and the delta\nof the Mississippi, what would become of the rice of the Carolinas, the\ntobacco of Virginia, and the sugar and cotton which grow in the valley\nof the Mississippi? Every portion of the federal budget does therefore\ncontribute to the maintenance of material interests which are common to\nall the confederate States.\n\nIndependently of this commercial utility, the South and the West of the\nUnion derive great political advantages from their connection with the\nNorth. The South contains an enormous slave population; a population\nwhich is already alarming, and still more formidable for the future. The\nStates of the West lie in the remotest parts of a single valley; and all\nthe rivers which intersect their territory rise in the Rocky Mountains\nor in the Alleghanies, and fall into the Mississippi, which bears them\nonwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The Western States are consequently\nentirely cut off, by their position, from the traditions of Europe and\nthe civilization of the Old World. The inhabitants of the South, then,\nare induced to support the Union in order to avail themselves of its\nprotection against the blacks; and the inhabitants of the West in order\nnot to be excluded from a free communication with the rest of the globe,\nand shut up in the wilds of central America. The North cannot but desire\nthe maintenance of the Union, in order to remain, as it now is, the\nconnecting link between that vast body and the other parts of the world.\n\nThe temporal interests of all the several parts of the Union are, then,\nintimately connected; and the same assertion holds true respecting those\nopinions and sentiments which may be termed the immaterial interests of\nmen.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part VII\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States talk a great deal of their\nattachment to their country; but I confess that I do not rely upon\nthat calculating patriotism which is founded upon interest, and which\na change in the interests at stake may obliterate. Nor do I attach much\nimportance to the language of the Americans, when they manifest, in\ntheir daily conversations, the intention of maintaining the federal\nsystem adopted by their forefathers. A government retains its sway\nover a great number of citizens, far less by the voluntary and rational\nconsent of the multitude, than by that instinctive, and to a certain\nextent involuntary agreement, which results from similarity of feelings\nand resemblances of opinion. I will never admit that men constitute a\nsocial body, simply because they obey the same head and the same laws.\nSociety can only exist when a great number of men consider a great\nnumber of things in the same point of view; when they hold the same\nopinions upon many subjects, and when the same occurrences suggest the\nsame thoughts and impressions to their minds.\n\nThe observer who examines the present condition of the United States\nupon this principle, will readily discover, that although the citizens\nare divided into twenty-four distinct sovereignties, they nevertheless\nconstitute a single people; and he may perhaps be led to think that the\nstate of the Anglo-American Union is more truly a state of society than\nthat of certain nations of Europe which live under the same legislation\nand the same prince.\n\nAlthough the Anglo-Americans have several religious sects, they all\nregard religion in the same manner. They are not always agreed upon the\nmeasures which are most conducive to good government, and they vary upon\nsome of the forms of government which it is expedient to adopt; but\nthey are unanimous upon the general principles which ought to rule\nhuman society. From Maine to the Floridas, and from the Missouri to the\nAtlantic Ocean, the people is held to be the legitimate source of all\npower. The same notions are entertained respecting liberty and equality,\nthe liberty of the press, the right of association, the jury, and the\nresponsibility of the agents of Government.\n\nIf we turn from their political and religious opinions to the moral and\nphilosophical principles which regulate the daily actions of life and\ngovern their conduct, we shall still find the same uniformity. The\nAnglo-Americans *d acknowledge the absolute moral authority of the\nreason of the community, as they acknowledge the political authority of\nthe mass of citizens; and they hold that public opinion is the surest\narbiter of what is lawful or forbidden, true or false. The majority\nof them believe that a man will be led to do what is just and good by\nfollowing his own interest rightly understood. They hold that every man\nis born in possession of the right of self-government, and that no one\nhas the right of constraining his fellow-creatures to be happy. They\nhave all a lively faith in the perfectibility of man; they are of\nopinion that the effects of the diffusion of knowledge must necessarily\nbe advantageous, and the consequences of ignorance fatal; they all\nconsider society as a body in a state of improvement, humanity as a\nchanging scene, in which nothing is, or ought to be, permanent; and they\nadmit that what appears to them to be good to-day may be superseded by\nsomething better-to-morrow. I do not give all these opinions as true,\nbut I quote them as characteristic of the Americans.\n\n[Footnote d: It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that by the\nexpression Anglo-Americans, I only mean to designate the great majority\nof the nation; for a certain number of isolated individuals are of\ncourse to be met with holding very different opinions.]\n\nThe Anglo-Americans are not only united together by these common\nopinions, but they are separated from all other nations by a common\nfeeling of pride. For the last fifty years no pains have been spared to\nconvince the inhabitants of the United States that they constitute the\nonly religious, enlightened, and free people. They perceive that, for\nthe present, their own democratic institutions succeed, whilst those\nof other countries fail; hence they conceive an overweening opinion\nof their superiority, and they are not very remote from believing\nthemselves to belong to a distinct race of mankind.\n\nThe dangers which threaten the American Union do not originate in the\ndiversity of interests or of opinions, but in the various characters and\npassions of the Americans. The men who inhabit the vast territory of\nthe United States are almost all the issue of a common stock; but the\neffects of the climate, and more especially of slavery, have gradually\nintroduced very striking differences between the British settler of the\nSouthern States and the British settler of the North. In Europe it is\ngenerally believed that slavery has rendered the interests of one\npart of the Union contrary to those of another part; but I by no means\nremarked this to be the case: slavery has not created interests in the\nSouth contrary to those of the North, but it has modified the character\nand changed the habits of the natives of the South.\n\nI have already explained the influence which slavery has exercised upon\nthe commercial ability of the Americans in the South; and this same\ninfluence equally extends to their manners. The slave is a servant who\nnever remonstrates, and who submits to everything without complaint. He\nmay sometimes assassinate, but he never withstands, his master. In the\nSouth there are no families so poor as not to have slaves. The citizen\nof the Southern States of the Union is invested with a sort of domestic\ndictatorship, from his earliest years; the first notion he acquires\nin life is that he is born to command, and the first habit which he\ncontracts is that of being obeyed without resistance. His education\ntends, then, to give him the character of a supercilious and a hasty\nman; irascible, violent, and ardent in his desires, impatient of\nobstacles, but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first\nattempt.\n\nThe American of the Northern States is surrounded by no slaves in\nhis childhood; he is even unattended by free servants, and is usually\nobliged to provide for his own wants. No sooner does he enter the world\nthan the idea of necessity assails him on every side: he soon learns\nto know exactly the natural limit of his authority; he never expects to\nsubdue those who withstand him, by force; and he knows that the surest\nmeans of obtaining the support of his fellow-creatures, is to win their\nfavor. He therefore becomes patient, reflecting, tolerant, slow to act,\nand persevering in his designs.\n\nIn the Southern States the more immediate wants of life are always\nsupplied; the inhabitants of those parts are not busied in the material\ncares of life, which are always provided for by others; and their\nimagination is diverted to more captivating and less definite objects.\nThe American of the South is fond of grandeur, luxury, and renown, of\ngayety, of pleasure, and above all of idleness; nothing obliges him\nto exert himself in order to subsist; and as he has no necessary\noccupations, he gives way to indolence, and does not even attempt what\nwould be useful.\n\nBut the equality of fortunes, and the absence of slavery in the North,\nplunge the inhabitants in those same cares of daily life which are\ndisdained by the white population of the South. They are taught from\ninfancy to combat want, and to place comfort above all the pleasures\nof the intellect or the heart. The imagination is extinguished by the\ntrivial details of life, and the ideas become less numerous and less\ngeneral, but far more practical and more precise. As prosperity is\nthe sole aim of exertion, it is excellently well attained; nature and\nmankind are turned to the best pecuniary advantage, and society is\ndexterously made to contribute to the welfare of each of its members,\nwhilst individual egotism is the source of general happiness.\n\nThe citizen of the North has not only experience, but knowledge:\nnevertheless he sets but little value upon the pleasures of knowledge;\nhe esteems it as the means of attaining a certain end, and he is only\nanxious to seize its more lucrative applications. The citizen of the\nSouth is more given to act upon impulse; he is more clever, more frank,\nmore generous, more intellectual, and more brilliant. The former, with\na greater degree of activity, of common-sense, of information, and of\ngeneral aptitude, has the characteristic good and evil qualities of\nthe middle classes. The latter has the tastes, the prejudices, the\nweaknesses, and the magnanimity of all aristocracies. If two men are\nunited in society, who have the same interests, and to a certain extent\nthe same opinions, but different characters, different acquirements, and\na different style of civilization, it is probable that these men will\nnot agree. The same remark is applicable to a society of nations.\nSlavery, then, does not attack the American Union directly in its\ninterests, but indirectly in its manners.\n\n[Footnote e: Census of 1790, 3,929,328; 1830, 12,856,165; 1860,\n31,443,321; 1870, 38,555,983; 1890, 62,831,900.]\n\nThe States which gave their assent to the federal contract in 1790 were\nthirteen in number; the Union now consists of thirty-four members. The\npopulation, which amounted to nearly 4,000,000 in 1790, had more than\ntripled in the space of forty years; and in 1830 it amounted to nearly\n13,000,000. *e Changes of such magnitude cannot take place without some\ndanger.\n\nA society of nations, as well as a society of individuals, derives its\nprincipal chances of duration from the wisdom of its members, their\nindividual weakness, and their limited number. The Americans who quit\nthe coasts of the Atlantic Ocean to plunge into the western wilderness,\nare adventurers impatient of restraint, greedy of wealth, and frequently\nmen expelled from the States in which they were born. When they arrive\nin the deserts they are unknown to each other, and they have neither\ntraditions, family feeling, nor the force of example to check their\nexcesses. The empire of the laws is feeble amongst them; that of\nmorality is still more powerless. The settlers who are constantly\npeopling the valley of the Mississippi are, then, in every respect very\ninferior to the Americans who inhabit the older parts of the Union.\nNevertheless, they already exercise a great influence in its councils;\nand they arrive at the government of the commonwealth before they have\nlearnt to govern themselves. *f\n\n[Footnote f: This indeed is only a temporary danger. I have no doubt\nthat in time society will assume as much stability and regularity in the\nWest as it has already done upon the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.]\n\nThe greater the individual weakness of each of the contracting parties,\nthe greater are the chances of the duration of the contract; for their\nsafety is then dependent upon their union. When, in 1790, the most\npopulous of the American republics did not contain 500,000 inhabitants,\n*g each of them felt its own insignificance as an independent people,\nand this feeling rendered compliance with the federal authority more\neasy. But when one of the confederate States reckons, like the State of\nNew York, 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and covers an extent of territory\nequal in surface to a quarter of France, *h it feels its own strength;\nand although it may continue to support the Union as advantageous to\nits prosperity, it no longer regards that body as necessary to its\nexistence, and as it continues to belong to the federal compact, it soon\naims at preponderance in the federal assemblies. The probable unanimity\nof the States is diminished as their number increases. At present the\ninterests of the different parts of the Union are not at variance; but\nwho is able to foresee the multifarious changes of the future, in a\ncountry in which towns are founded from day to day, and States almost\nfrom year to year?\n\n[Footnote g: Pennsylvania contained 431,373 inhabitants in 1790 [and\n5,258,014 in 1890.]]\n\n[Footnote h: The area of the State of New York is 49,170 square miles.\n[See U. S. census report of 1890.]]\n\nSince the first settlement of the British colonies, the number of\ninhabitants has about doubled every twenty-two years. I perceive no\ncauses which are likely to check this progressive increase of the\nAnglo-American population for the next hundred years; and before\nthat space of time has elapsed, I believe that the territories\nand dependencies of the United States will be covered by more than\n100,000,000 of inhabitants, and divided into forty States. *i I admit\nthat these 100,000,000 of men have no hostile interests. I suppose,\non the contrary, that they are all equally interested in the maintenance\nof the Union; but I am still of opinion that where there are 100,000,000\nof men, and forty distinct nations, unequally strong, the continuance of\nthe Federal Government can only be a fortunate accident.\n\n[Footnote i: If the population continues to double every twenty-two\nyears, as it has done for the last two hundred years, the number of\ninhabitants in the United States in 1852 will be twenty millions; in\n1874, forty-eight millions; and in 1896, ninety-six millions. This may\nstill be the case even if the lands on the western slope of the Rocky\nMountains should be found to be unfit for cultivation. The territory\nwhich is already occupied can easily contain this number of inhabitants.\nOne hundred millions of men disseminated over the surface of the\ntwenty-four States, and the three dependencies, which constitute the\nUnion, would only give 762 inhabitants to the square league; this would\nbe far below the mean population of France, which is 1,063 to the square\nleague; or of England, which is 1,457; and it would even be below the\npopulation of Switzerland, for that country, notwithstanding its lakes\nand mountains, contains 783 inhabitants to the square league. See \"Malte\nBrun,\" vol. vi. p. 92.\n\n[The actual result has fallen somewhat short of these calculations, in\nspite of the vast territorial acquisitions of the United States: but in\n1899 the population is probably about eighty-seven millions, including\nthe population of the Philippines, Hawaii, and Porto Rico.]]\n\nWhatever faith I may have in the perfectibility of man, until human\nnature is altered, and men wholly transformed, I shall refuse to believe\nin the duration of a government which is called upon to hold together\nforty different peoples, disseminated over a territory equal to one-half\nof Europe in extent; to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and struggles\nbetween them, and to direct their independent activity to the\naccomplishment of the same designs.\n\nBut the greatest peril to which the Union is exposed by its increase\narises from the continual changes which take place in the position of\nits internal strength. The distance from Lake Superior to the Gulf of\nMexico extends from the 47th to the 30th degree of latitude, a distance\nof more than 1,200 miles as the bird flies. The frontier of the United\nStates winds along the whole of this immense line, sometimes falling\nwithin its limits, but more frequently extending far beyond it, into the\nwaste. It has been calculated that the whites advance every year a mean\ndistance of seventeen miles along the whole of his vast boundary. *j\nObstacles, such as an unproductive district, a lake or an Indian nation\nunexpectedly encountered, are sometimes met with. The advancing column\nthen halts for a while; its two extremities fall back upon themselves,\nand as soon as they are reunited they proceed onwards. This gradual and\ncontinuous progress of the European race towards the Rocky Mountains has\nthe solemnity of a providential event; it is like a deluge of men rising\nunabatedly, and daily driven onwards by the hand of God.\n\n[Footnote j: See Legislative Documents, 20th Congress, No. 117, p. 105.]\n\nWithin this first line of conquering settlers towns are built, and\nvast States founded. In 1790 there were only a few thousand pioneers\nsprinkled along the valleys of the Mississippi; and at the present day\nthese valleys contain as many inhabitants as were to be found in the\nwhole Union in 1790. Their population amounts to nearly 4,000,000. *k\nThe city of Washington was founded in 1800, in the very centre of the\nUnion; but such are the changes which have taken place, that it now\nstands at one of the extremities; and the delegates of the most remote\nWestern States are already obliged to perform a journey as long as that\nfrom Vienna to Paris. *l\n\n[Footnote k: 3,672,317--Census of 1830.]\n\n[Footnote l: The distance from Jefferson, the capital of the State of\nMissouri, to Washington is 1,019 miles. (\"American Almanac,\" 1831, p.\n48.)]\n\nAll the States are borne onwards at the same time in the path of\nfortune, but of course they do not all increase and prosper in the\nsame proportion. To the North of the Union the detached branches of\nthe Alleghany chain, which extend as far as the Atlantic Ocean, form\nspacious roads and ports, which are constantly accessible to vessels\nof the greatest burden. But from the Potomac to the mouth of the\nMississippi the coast is sandy and flat. In this part of the Union the\nmouths of almost all the rivers are obstructed; and the few harbors\nwhich exist amongst these lagoons afford much shallower water to\nvessels, and much fewer commercial advantages than those of the North.\n\nThis first natural cause of inferiority is united to another cause\nproceeding from the laws. We have already seen that slavery, which is\nabolished in the North, still exists in the South; and I have pointed\nout its fatal consequences upon the prosperity of the planter himself.\n\nThe North is therefore superior to the South both in commerce *m and\nmanufacture; the natural consequence of which is the more rapid increase\nof population and of wealth within its borders. The States situate upon\nthe shores of the Atlantic Ocean are already half-peopled. Most of the\nland is held by an owner; and these districts cannot therefore receive\nso many emigrants as the Western States, where a boundless field is\nstill open to their exertions. The valley of the Mississippi is far more\nfertile than the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. This reason, added to all\nthe others, contributes to drive the Europeans westward--a fact which\nmay be rigorously demonstrated by figures. It is found that the sum\ntotal of the population of all the United States has about tripled in\nthe course of forty years. But in the recent States adjacent to the\nMississippi, the population has increased thirty-one-fold, within the\nsame space of time. *n\n\n[Footnote m: The following statements will suffice to show the\ndifference which exists between the commerce of the South and that of\nthe North:--\n\nIn 1829 the tonnage of all the merchant vessels belonging to Virginia,\nthe two Carolinas, and Georgia (the four great Southern States),\namounted to only 5,243 tons. In the same year the tonnage of the vessels\nof the State of Massachusetts alone amounted to 17,322 tons. (See\nLegislative Documents, 21st Congress, 2d session, No. 140, p. 244.) Thus\nthe State of Massachusetts had three times as much shipping as the\nfour above-mentioned States. Nevertheless the area of the State of\nMassachusetts is only 7,335 square miles, and its population amounts\nto 610,014 inhabitants [2,238,943 in 1890]; whilst the area of the four\nother States I have quoted is 210,000 square miles, and their population\n3,047,767. Thus the area of the State of Massachusetts forms only\none-thirtieth part of the area of the four States; and its population\nis five times smaller than theirs. (See \"Darby's View of the United\nStates.\") Slavery is prejudicial to the commercial prosperity of the\nSouth in several different ways; by diminishing the spirit of enterprise\namongst the whites, and by preventing them from meeting with as numerous\na class of sailors as they require. Sailors are usually taken from the\nlowest ranks of the population. But in the Southern States these lowest\nranks are composed of slaves, and it is very difficult to employ them at\nsea. They are unable to serve as well as a white crew, and apprehensions\nwould always be entertained of their mutinying in the middle of the\nocean, or of their escaping in the foreign countries at which they might\ntouch.]\n\n[Footnote n: \"Darby's View of the United States,\" p. 444.]\n\nThe relative position of the central federal power is continually\ndisplaced. Forty years ago the majority of the citizens of the Union was\nestablished upon the coast of the Atlantic, in the environs of the spot\nupon which Washington now stands; but the great body of the people\nis now advancing inland and to the north, so that in twenty years the\nmajority will unquestionably be on the western side of the Alleghanies.\nIf the Union goes on to subsist, the basin of the Mississippi is\nevidently marked out, by its fertility and its extent, as the future\ncentre of the Federal Government. In thirty or forty years, that tract\nof country will have assumed the rank which naturally belongs to it. It\nis easy to calculate that its population, compared to that of the coast\nof the Atlantic, will be, in round numbers, as 40 to 11. In a few\nyears the States which founded the Union will lose the direction of\nits policy, and the population of the valley of the Mississippi will\npreponderate in the federal assemblies.\n\nThis constant gravitation of the federal power and influence towards\nthe northwest is shown every ten years, when a general census of the\npopulation is made, and the number of delegates which each State\nsends to Congress is settled afresh. *o In 1790 Virginia had nineteen\nrepresentatives in Congress. This number continued to increase until the\nyear 1813, when it reached to twenty-three; from that time it began to\ndecrease, and in 1833 Virginia elected only twenty-one representatives.\n*p During the same period the State of New York progressed in the\ncontrary direction: in 1790 it had ten representatives in Congress; in\n1813, twenty-seven; in 1823, thirty-four; and in 1833, forty. The State\nof Ohio had only one representative in 1803, and in 1833 it had already\nnineteen.\n\n[Footnote o: It may be seen that in the course of the last ten years\n(1820-1830) the population of one district, as, for instance, the State\nof Delaware, has increased in the proportion of five per cent.; whilst\nthat of another, as the territory of Michigan, has increased 250 per\ncent. Thus the population of Virginia had augmented thirteen per cent.,\nand that of the border State of Ohio sixty-one per cent., in the same\nspace of time. The general table of these changes, which is given in the\n\"National Calendar,\" displays a striking picture of the unequal fortunes\nof the different States.]\n\n[Footnote p: It has just been said that in the course of the last term\nthe population of Virginia has increased thirteen per cent.; and it is\nnecessary to explain how the number of representatives for a State may\ndecrease, when the population of that State, far from diminishing, is\nactually upon the increase. I take the State of Virginia, to which\nI have already alluded, as my term of comparison. The number of\nrepresentatives of Virginia in 1823 was proportionate to the total\nnumber of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which\nthe population bore to that of the whole Union: in 1833 the number of\nrepresentatives of Virginia was likewise proportionate to the total\nnumber of the representatives of the Union, and to the relation which\nits population, augmented in the course of ten years, bore to the\naugmented population of the Union in the same space of time. The new\nnumber of Virginian representatives will then be to the old numver, on\nthe one hand, as the new numver of all the representatives is to the old\nnumber; and, on the other hand, as the augmentation of the population of\nVirginia is to that of the whole population of the country. Thus, if\nthe increase of the population of the lesser country be to that of the\ngreater in an exact inverse ratio of the proportion between the new\nand the old numbers of all the representatives, the number of the\nrepresentatives of Virginia will remain stationary; and if the\nincrease of the Virginian population be to that of the whole Union in a\nfeeblerratio than the new number of the representatives of the Union\nto the old number, the number of the representatives of Virginia\nmust decrease. [Thus, to the 56th Congress in 1899, Virginia and West\nVirginia send only fourteen representatives.]]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part VIII\n\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a durable union of a people which is rich and\nstrong with one which is poor and weak, even if it were proved that the\nstrength and wealth of the one are not the causes of the weakness and\npoverty of the other. But union is still more difficult to maintain at a\ntime at which one party is losing strength, and the other is gaining it.\nThis rapid and disproportionate increase of certain States threatens\nthe independence of the others. New York might perhaps succeed, with its\n2,000,000 of inhabitants and its forty representatives, in dictating to\nthe other States in Congress. But even if the more powerful States make\nno attempt to bear down the lesser ones, the danger still exists; for\nthere is almost as much in the possibility of the act as in the act\nitself. The weak generally mistrust the justice and the reason of the\nstrong. The States which increase less rapidly than the others look upon\nthose which are more favored by fortune with envy and suspicion. Hence\narise the deep-seated uneasiness and ill-defined agitation which are\nobservable in the South, and which form so striking a contrast to the\nconfidence and prosperity which are common to other parts of the Union.\nI am inclined to think that the hostile measures taken by the Southern\nprovinces upon a recent occasion are attributable to no other cause. The\ninhabitants of the Southern States are, of all the Americans, those\nwho are most interested in the maintenance of the Union; they would\nassuredly suffer most from being left to themselves; and yet they are\nthe only citizens who threaten to break the tie of confederation. But\nit is easy to perceive that the South, which has given four Presidents,\nWashington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, to the Union, which\nperceives that it is losing its federal influence, and that the number\nof its representatives in Congress is diminishing from year to year,\nwhilst those of the Northern and Western States are increasing; the\nSouth, which is peopled with ardent and irascible beings, is becoming\nmore and more irritated and alarmed. The citizens reflect upon their\npresent position and remember their past influence, with the melancholy\nuneasiness of men who suspect oppression: if they discover a law of\nthe Union which is not unequivocally favorable to their interests,\nthey protest against it as an abuse of force; and if their ardent\nremonstrances are not listened to, they threaten to quit an association\nwhich loads them with burdens whilst it deprives them of their due\nprofits. \"The tariff,\" said the inhabitants of Carolina in 1832,\n\"enriches the North, and ruins the South; for if this were not the case,\nto what can we attribute the continually increasing power and wealth\nof the North, with its inclement skies and arid soil; whilst the South,\nwhich may be styled the garden of America, is rapidly declining?\" *q\n\n[Footnote q: See the report of its committee to the Convention which\nproclaimed the nullification of the tariff in South Carolina.]\n\nIf the changes which I have described were gradual, so that each\ngeneration at least might have time to disappear with the order of\nthings under which it had lived, the danger would be less; but the\nprogress of society in America is precipitate, and almost revolutionary.\nThe same citizen may have lived to see his State take the lead in the\nUnion, and afterwards become powerless in the federal assemblies; and\nan Anglo-American republic has been known to grow as rapidly as a man\npassing from birth and infancy to maturity in the course of thirty\nyears. It must not be imagined, however, that the States which lose\ntheir preponderance, also lose their population or their riches: no stop\nis put to their prosperity, and they even go on to increase more\nrapidly than any kingdom in Europe. *r But they believe themselves to be\nimpoverished because their wealth does not augment as rapidly as that of\ntheir neighbors; any they think that their power is lost, because they\nsuddenly come into collision with a power greater than their own: *s\nthus they are more hurt in their feelings and their passions than\nin their interests. But this is amply sufficient to endanger the\nmaintenance of the Union. If kings and peoples had only had their true\ninterests in view ever since the beginning of the world, the name of war\nwould scarcely be known among mankind.\n\n[Footnote r: The population of a country assuredly constitutes the\nfirst element of its wealth. In the ten years (1820-1830) during which\nVirginia lost two of its representatives in Congress, its population\nincreased in the proportion of 13.7 per cent.; that of Carolina in the\nproportion of fifteen per cent.; and that of Georgia, 15.5 per cent.\n(See the \"American Almanac,\" 1832, p. 162) But the population of Russia,\nwhich increases more rapidly than that of any other European country,\nonly augments in ten years at the rate of 9.5 per cent.; in France, at\nthe rate of seven per cent.; and in Europe in general, at the rate of\n4.7 per cent. (See \"Malte Brun,\" vol. vi. p. 95)]\n\n[Footnote s: It must be admitted, however, that the depreciation which\nhas taken place in the value of tobacco, during the last fifty years,\nhas notably diminished the opulence of the Southern planters: but this\ncircumstance is as independent of the will of their Northern brethren as\nit is of their own.]\n\nThus the prosperity of the United States is the source of the most\nserious dangers that threaten them, since it tends to create in some of\nthe confederate States that over-excitement which accompanies a rapid\nincrease of fortune; and to awaken in others those feelings of envy,\nmistrust, and regret which usually attend upon the loss of it. The\nAmericans contemplate this extraordinary and hasty progress with\nexultation; but they would be wiser to consider it with sorrow and\nalarm. The Americans of the United States must inevitably become one of\nthe greatest nations in the world; their offset will cover almost\nthe whole of North America; the continent which they inhabit is their\ndominion, and it cannot escape them. What urges them to take possession\nof it so soon? Riches, power, and renown cannot fail to be theirs at\nsome future time, but they rush upon their fortune as if but a moment\nremained for them to make it their own.\n\nI think that I have demonstrated that the existence of the present\nconfederation depends entirely on the continued assent of all the\nconfederates; and, starting from this principle, I have inquired into\nthe causes which may induce the several States to separate from the\nothers. The Union may, however, perish in two different ways: one of\nthe confederate States may choose to retire from the compact, and so\nforcibly to sever the federal tie; and it is to this supposition that\nmost of the remarks that I have made apply: or the authority of\nthe Federal Government may be progressively entrenched on by the\nsimultaneous tendency of the united republics to resume their\nindependence. The central power, successively stripped of all its\nprerogatives, and reduced to impotence by tacit consent, would become\nincompetent to fulfil its purpose; and the second Union would perish,\nlike the first, by a sort of senile inaptitude. The gradual weakening of\nthe federal tie, which may finally lead to the dissolution of the\nUnion, is a distinct circumstance, that may produce a variety of minor\nconsequences before it operates so violent a change. The confederation\nmight still subsist, although its Government were reduced to such\na degree of inanition as to paralyze the nation, to cause internal\nanarchy, and to check the general prosperity of the country.\n\nAfter having investigated the causes which may induce the\nAnglo-Americans to disunite, it is important to inquire whether, if the\nUnion continues to subsist, their Government will extend or contract\nits sphere of action, and whether it will become more energetic or more\nweak.\n\n\nThe Americans are evidently disposed to look upon their future condition\nwith alarm. They perceive that in most of the nations of the world the\nexercise of the rights of sovereignty tends to fall under the control of\na few individuals, and they are dismayed by the idea that such will also\nbe the case in their own country. Even the statesmen feel, or affect\nto feel, these fears; for, in America, centralization is by no means\npopular, and there is no surer means of courting the majority than by\ninveighing against the encroachments of the central power. The Americans\ndo not perceive that the countries in which this alarming tendency to\ncentralization exists are inhabited by a single people; whilst the fact\nof the Union being composed of different confederate communities is\nsufficient to baffle all the inferences which might be drawn from\nanalogous circumstances. I confess that I am inclined to consider the\nfears of a great number of Americans as purely imaginary; and far from\nparticipating in their dread of the consolidation of power in the hands\nof the Union, I think that the Federal Government is visibly losing\nstrength.\n\nTo prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote\noccurrences, but to circumstances which I have myself witnessed, and\nwhich belong to our own time.\n\nAn attentive examination of what is going on in the United States will\neasily convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country,\nlike two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same\nchannel. The Union has now existed for forty-five years, and in the\ncourse of that time a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were\nat first hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling\nwhich attached each of the Americans to his own native State is become\nless exclusive; and the different parts of the Union have become more\nintimately connected the better they have become acquainted with each\nother. The post, *t that great instrument of intellectual intercourse,\nnow reaches into the backwoods; and steamboats have established daily\nmeans of communication between the different points of the coast. An\ninland navigation of unexampled rapidity conveys commodities up and down\nthe rivers of the country. *u And to these facilities of nature and art\nmay be added those restless cravings, that busy-mindedness, and love\nof pelf, which are constantly urging the American into active life,\nand bringing him into contact with his fellow-citizens. He crosses the\ncountry in every direction; he visits all the various populations of the\nland; and there is not a province in France in which the natives are\nso well known to each other as the 13,000,000 of men who cover the\nterritory of the United States.\n\n[Footnote t: In 1832, the district of Michigan, which only contains\n31,639 inhabitants, and is still an almost unexplored wilderness,\npossessed 940 miles of mail-roads. The territory of Arkansas, which\nis still more uncultivated, was already intersected by 1,938 miles of\nmail-roads. (See the report of the General Post Office, November 30,\n1833.) The postage of newspapers alone in the whole Union amounted to\n$254,796.]\n\n[Footnote u: In the course of ten years, from 1821 to 1831, 271\nsteamboats have been launched upon the rivers which water the valley\nof the Mississippi alone. In 1829 259 steamboats existed in the United\nStates. (See Legislative Documents, No. 140, p. 274.)]\n\nBut whilst the Americans intermingle, they grow in resemblance of each\nother; the differences resulting from their climate, their origin, and\ntheir institutions, diminish; and they all draw nearer and nearer to the\ncommon type. Every year, thousands of men leave the North to settle in\ndifferent parts of the Union: they bring with them their faith, their\nopinions, and their manners; and as they are more enlighthned than the\nmen amongst whom they are about to dwell, they soon rise to the head of\naffairs, and they adapt society to their own advantage. This continual\nemigration of the North to the South is peculiarly favorable to the\nfusion of all the different provincial characters into one national\ncharacter. The civilization of the North appears to be the common\nstandard, to which the whole nation will one day be assimilated.\n\nThe commercial ties which unite the confederate States are strengthened\nby the increasing manufactures of the Americans; and the union which\nbegan to exist in their opinions, gradually forms a part of their\nhabits: the course of time has swept away the bugbear thoughts which\nhaunted the imaginations of the citizens in 1789. The federal power\nis not become oppressive; it has not destroyed the independence of\nthe States; it has not subjected the confederates to monarchial\ninstitutions; and the Union has not rendered the lesser States dependent\nupon the larger ones; but the confederation has continued to increase in\npopulation, in wealth, and in power. I am therefore convinced that the\nnatural obstacles to the continuance of the American Union are not so\npowerful at the present time as they were in 1789; and that the enemies\nof the Union are not so numerous.\n\nNevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States\nfor the last forty-five years will readily convince us that the federal\npower is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this\nphenomenon. *v When the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the\nnation was a prey to anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion,\nexcited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly supported\nbecause it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although it was more\nattacked than it is now, the federal power soon reached the maximum of\nits authority, as is usually the case with a government which triumphs\nafter having braced its strength by the struggle. At that time the\ninterpretation of the Constitution seemed to extend, rather than to\nrepress, the federal sovereignty; and the Union offered, in several\nrespects, the appearance of a single and undivided people, directed in\nits foreign and internal policy by a single Government. But to attain\nthis point the people had risen, to a certain extent, above itself.\n\n\n[Footnote v: [Since 1861 the movement is certainly in the opposite\ndirection, and the federal power has largely increased, and tends to\nfurther increase.]]\n\nThe Constitution had not destroyed the distinct sovereignty of the\nStates; and all communities, of whatever nature they may be, are\nimpelled by a secret propensity to assert their independence. This\npropensity is still more decided in a country like America, in which\nevery village forms a sort of republic accustomed to conduct its own\naffairs. It therefore cost the States an effort to submit to the federal\nsupremacy; and all efforts, however successful they may be, necessarily\nsubside with the causes in which they originated.\n\nAs the Federal Government consolidated its authority, America resumed\nits rank amongst the nations, peace returned to its frontiers, and\npublic credit was restored; confusion was succeeded by a fixed state of\nthings, which was favorable to the full and free exercise of industrious\nenterprise. It was this very prosperity which made the Americans forget\nthe cause to which it was attributable; and when once the danger was\npassed, the energy and the patriotism which had enabled them to brave\nit disappeared from amongst them. No sooner were they delivered from the\ncares which oppressed them, than they easily returned to their ordinary\nhabits, and gave themselves up without resistance to their natural\ninclinations. When a powerful Government no longer appeared to\nbe necessary, they once more began to think it irksome. The Union\nencouraged a general prosperity, and the States were not inclined to\nabandon the Union; but they desired to render the action of the power\nwhich represented that body as light as possible. The general principle\nof Union was adopted, but in every minor detail there was an actual\ntendency to independence. The principle of confederation was every\nday more easily admitted, and more rarely applied; so that the Federal\nGovernment brought about its own decline, whilst it was creating order\nand peace.\n\nAs soon as this tendency of public opinion began to be manifested\nexternally, the leaders of parties, who live by the passions of the\npeople, began to work it to their own advantage. The position of the\nFederal Government then became exceedingly critical. Its enemies were\nin possession of the popular favor; and they obtained the right of\nconducting its policy by pledging themselves to lessen its influence.\nFrom that time forwards the Government of the Union has invariably been\nobliged to recede, as often as it has attempted to enter the lists with\nthe governments of the States. And whenever an interpretation of\nthe terms of the Federal Constitution has been called for, that\ninterpretation has most frequently been opposed to the Union, and\nfavorable to the States.\n\nThe Constitution invested the Federal Government with the right of\nproviding for the interests of the nation; and it had been held that no\nother authority was so fit to superintend the \"internal improvements\"\nwhich affected the prosperity of the whole Union; such, for instance, as\nthe cutting of canals. But the States were alarmed at a power,\ndistinct from their own, which could thus dispose of a portion of their\nterritory; and they were afraid that the central Government would, by\nthis means, acquire a formidable extent of patronage within their own\nconfines, and exercise a degree of influence which they intended to\nreserve exclusively to their own agents. The Democratic party, which has\nconstantly been opposed to the increase of the federal authority,\nthen accused the Congress of usurpation, and the Chief Magistrate of\nambition. The central Government was intimidated by the opposition;\nand it soon acknowledged its error, promising exactly to confine its\ninfluence for the future within the circle which was prescribed to it.\n\nThe Constitution confers upon the Union the right of treating with\nforeign nations. The Indian tribes, which border upon the frontiers of\nthe United States, had usually been regarded in this light. As long as\nthese savages consented to retire before the civilized settlers,\nthe federal right was not contested: but as soon as an Indian tribe\nattempted to fix its dwelling upon a given spot, the adjacent States\nclaimed possession of the lands and the rights of sovereignty over the\nnatives. The central Government soon recognized both these claims; and\nafter it had concluded treaties with the Indians as independent nations,\nit gave them up as subjects to the legislative tyranny of the States. *w\n\n[Footnote w: See in the Legislative Documents, already quoted in\nspeaking of the Indians, the letter of the President of the United\nStates to the Cherokees, his correspondence on this subject with his\nagents, and his messages to Congress.]\n\nSome of the States which had been founded upon the coast of the\nAtlantic, extended indefinitely to the West, into wild regions where no\nEuropean had ever penetrated. The States whose confines were irrevocably\nfixed, looked with a jealous eye upon the unbounded regions which the\nfuture would enable their neighbors to explore. The latter then agreed,\nwith a view to conciliate the others, and to facilitate the act\nof union, to lay down their own boundaries, and to abandon all the\nterritory which lay beyond those limits to the confederation at large.\n*x Thenceforward the Federal Government became the owner of all the\nuncultivated lands which lie beyond the borders of the thirteen States\nfirst confederated. It was invested with the right of parcelling and\nselling them, and the sums derived from this source were exclusively\nreserved to the public treasure of the Union, in order to furnish\nsupplies for purchasing tracts of country from the Indians, for opening\nroads to the remote settlements, and for accelerating the increase of\ncivilization as much as possible. New States have, however, been formed\nin the course of time, in the midst of those wilds which were formerly\nceded by the inhabitants of the shores of the Atlantic. Congress has\ngone on to sell, for the profit of the nation at large, the uncultivated\nlands which those new States contained. But the latter at length\nasserted that, as they were now fully constituted, they ought to enjoy\nthe exclusive right of converting the produce of these sales to their\nown use. As their remonstrances became more and more threatening,\nCongress thought fit to deprive the Union of a portion of the privileges\nwhich it had hitherto enjoyed; and at the end of 1832 it passed a law\nby which the greatest part of the revenue derived from the sale of\nlands was made over to the new western republics, although the lands\nthemselves were not ceded to them. *y\n\n[Footnote x: The first act of session was made by the State of New York\nin 1780; Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South and North Carolina,\nfollowed this example at different times, and lastly, the act of cession\nof Georgia was made as recently as 1802.]\n\n[Footnote y: It is true that the President refused his assent to this\nlaw; but he completely adopted it in principle. (See Message of December\n8, 1833.)]\n\nThe slightest observation in the United States enables one to appreciate\nthe advantages which the country derives from the bank. These advantages\nare of several kinds, but one of them is peculiarly striking to the\nstranger. The banknotes of the United States are taken upon the borders\nof the desert for the same value as at Philadelphia, where the bank\nconducts its operations. *z\n\n[Footnote z: The present Bank of the United States was established in\n1816, with a capital of $35,000,000; its charter expires in 1836. Last\nyear Congress passed a law to renew it, but the President put his veto\nupon the bill. The struggle is still going on with great violence on\neither side, and the speedy fall of the bank may easily be foreseen. [It\nwas soon afterwards extinguished by General Jackson.]]\n\nThe Bank of the United States is nevertheless the object of great\nanimosity. Its directors have proclaimed their hostility to the\nPresident: and they are accused, not without some show of probability,\nof having abused their influence to thwart his election. The President\ntherefore attacks the establishment which they represent with all the\nwarmth of personal enmity; and he is encouraged in the pursuit of\nhis revenge by the conviction that he is supported by the secret\npropensities of the majority. The bank may be regarded as the great\nmonetary tie of the Union, just as Congress is the great legislative\ntie; and the same passions which tend to render the States independent\nof the central power, contribute to the overthrow of the bank.\n\nThe Bank of the United States always holds a great number of the notes\nissued by the provincial banks, which it can at any time oblige them to\nconvert into cash. It has itself nothing to fear from a similar demand,\nas the extent of its resources enables it to meet all claims. But\nthe existence of the provincial banks is thus threatened, and their\noperations are restricted, since they are only able to issue a quantity\nof notes duly proportioned to their capital. They submit with impatience\nto this salutary control. The newspapers which they have bought over,\nand the President, whose interest renders him their instrument, attack\nthe bank with the greatest vehemence. They rouse the local passions and\nthe blind democratic instinct of the country to aid their cause; and\nthey assert that the bank directors form a permanent aristocratic body,\nwhose influence must ultimately be felt in the Government, and must\naffect those principles of equality upon which society rests in America.\n\nThe contest between the bank and its opponents is only an incident in\nthe great struggle which is going on in America between the provinces\nand the central power; between the spirit of democratic independence\nand the spirit of gradation and subordination. I do not mean that the\nenemies of the bank are identically the same individuals who, on other\npoints, attack the Federal Government; but I assert that the attacks\ndirected against the bank of the United States originate in the same\npropensities which militate against the Federal Government; and that the\nvery numerous opponents of the former afford a deplorable symptom of the\ndecreasing support of the latter.\n\nThe Union has never displayed so much weakness as in the celebrated\nquestion of the tariff. *a The wars of the French Revolution and of 1812\nhad created manufacturing establishments in the North of the Union,\nby cutting off all free communication between America and Europe. When\npeace was concluded, and the channel of intercourse reopened by which\nthe produce of Europe was transmitted to the New World, the Americans\nthought fit to establish a system of import duties, for the twofold\npurpose of protecting their incipient manufactures and of paying off the\namount of the debt contracted during the war. The Southern States,\nwhich have no manufactures to encourage, and which are exclusively\nagricultural, soon complained of this measure. Such were the simple\nfacts, and I do not pretend to examine in this place whether their\ncomplaints were well founded or unjust.\n\n[Footnote a: See principally for the details of this affair, the\nLegislative Documents, 22d Congress, 2d Session, No. 30.]\n\nAs early as the year 1820, South Carolina declared, in a petition\nto Congress, that the tariff was \"unconstitutional, oppressive, and\nunjust.\" And the States of Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama,\nand Mississippi subsequently remonstrated against it with more or less\nvigor. But Congress, far from lending an ear to these complaints, raised\nthe scale of tariff duties in the years 1824 and 1828, and recognized\nanew the principle on which it was founded. A doctrine was then\nproclaimed, or rather revived, in the South, which took the name of\nNullification.\n\n\nI have shown in the proper place that the object of the Federal\nConstitution was not to form a league, but to create a national\ngovernment. The Americans of the United States form a sole and undivided\npeople, in all the cases which are specified by that Constitution; and\nupon these points the will of the nation is expressed, as it is in all\nconstitutional nations, by the voice of the majority. When the majority\nhas pronounced its decision, it is the duty of the minority to submit.\nSuch is the sound legal doctrine, and the only one which agrees with the\ntext of the Constitution, and the known intention of those who framed\nit.\n\nThe partisans of Nullification in the South maintain, on the contrary,\nthat the intention of the Americans in uniting was not to reduce\nthemselves to the condition of one and the same people; that they meant\nto constitute a league of independent States; and that each State,\nconsequently retains its entire sovereignty, if not de facto, at least\nde jure; and has the right of putting its own construction upon the laws\nof Congress, and of suspending their execution within the limits of its\nown territory, if they are held to be unconstitutional and unjust.\n\nThe entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered\nby Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the South,\nbefore the Senate of the United States, in the year 1833: could: \"The\nConstitution is a compact to which the States were parties in their\nsovereign capacity; now, whenever a compact is entered into by parties\nwhich acknowledge no tribunal above their authority to decide in the\nlast resort, each of them has a right to judge for itself in relation\nto the nature, extent, and obligations of the instrument.\" It is\nevident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of the Federal\nConstitution, and brings back all the evils of the old confederation,\nfrom which the Americans were supposed to have had a safe deliverance.\n\nWhen South Carolina perceived that Congress turned a deaf ear to its\nremonstrances, it threatened to apply the doctrine of nullification to\nthe federal tariff bill. Congress persisted in its former system; and at\nlength the storm broke out. In the course of 1832 the citizens of\nSouth Carolina, *b named a national Convention, to consult upon the\nextraordinary measures which they were called upon to take; and on\nNovember 24th of the same year this Convention promulgated a law, under\nthe form of a decree, which annulled the federal law of the tariff,\nforbade the levy of the imposts which that law commands, and refused to\nrecognize the appeal which might be made to the federal courts of law.\n*c This decree was only to be put in execution in the ensuing month of\nFebruary, and it was intimated, that if Congress modified the tariff\nbefore that period, South Carolina might be induced to proceed no\nfurther with her menaces; and a vague desire was afterwards expressed\nof submitting the question to an extraordinary assembly of all the\nconfederate States.\n\n[Footnote b: That is to say, the majority of the people; for the\nopposite party, called the Union party, always formed a very strong and\nactive minority. Carolina may contain about 47,000 electors; 30,000 were\nin favor of nullification, and 17,000 opposed to it.]\n\n[Footnote c: This decree was preceded by a report of the committee\nby which it was framed, containing the explanation of the motives and\nobject of the law. The following passage occurs in it, p. 34:--\"When\nthe rights reserved by the Constitution to the different States are\ndeliberately violated, it is the duty and the right of those States\nto interfere, in order to check the progress of the evil; to resist\nusurpation, and to maintain, within their respective limits, those\npowers and privileges which belong to them as independent sovereign\nStates. If they were destitute of this right, they would not be\nsovereign. South Carolina declares that she acknowledges no tribunal\nupon earth above her authority. She has indeed entered into a solemn\ncompact of union with the other States; but she demands, and will\nexercise, the right of putting her own construction upon it; and when\nthis compact is violated by her sister States, and by the Government\nwhich they have created, she is determined to avail herself of the\nunquestionable right of judging what is the extent of the infraction,\nand what are the measures best fitted to obtain justice.\"]\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part IX\n\nIn the meantime South Carolina armed her militia, and prepared for war.\nBut Congress, which had slighted its suppliant subjects, listened to\ntheir complaints as soon as they were found to have taken up arms. *d\nA law was passed, by which the tariff duties were to be progressively\nreduced for ten years, until they were brought so low as not to exceed\nthe amount of supplies necessary to the Government. *e Thus Congress\ncompletely abandoned the principle of the tariff; and substituted a mere\nfiscal impost to a system of protective duties. *f The Government of\nthe Union, in order to conceal its defeat, had recourse to an expedient\nwhich is very much in vogue with feeble governments. It yielded the\npoint de facto, but it remained inflexible upon the principles in\nquestion; and whilst Congress was altering the tariff law, it passed\nanother bill, by which the President was invested with extraordinary\npowers, enabling him to overcome by force a resistance which was then no\nlonger to be apprehended.\n\n[Footnote d: Congress was finally decided to take this step by the\nconduct of the powerful State of Virginia, whose legislature offered\nto serve as mediator between the Union and South Carolina. Hitherto the\nlatter State had appeared to be entirely abandoned, even by the States\nwhich had joined in her remonstrances.]\n\n[Footnote e: This law was passed on March 2, 1833.]\n\n[Footnote f: This bill was brought in by Mr. Clay, and it passed in four\ndays through both Houses of Congress by an immense majority.]\n\nBut South Carolina did not consent to leave the Union in the enjoyment\nof these scanty trophies of success: the same national Convention which\nhad annulled the tariff bill, met again, and accepted the proffered\nconcession; but at the same time it declared it unabated perseverance\nin the doctrine of Nullification: and to prove what it said, it annulled\nthe law investing the President with extraordinary powers, although it\nwas very certain that the clauses of that law would never be carried\ninto effect.\n\nAlmost all the controversies of which I have been speaking have taken\nplace under the Presidency of General Jackson; and it cannot be denied\nthat in the question of the tariff he has supported the claims of the\nUnion with vigor and with skill. I am, however, of opinion that the\nconduct of the individual who now represents the Federal Government may\nbe reckoned as one of the dangers which threaten its continuance.\n\nSome persons in Europe have formed an opinion of the possible influence\nof General Jackson upon the affairs of his country, which appears highly\nextravagant to those who have seen more of the subject. We have\nbeen told that General Jackson has won sundry battles, that he is\nan energetic man, prone by nature and by habit to the use of force,\ncovetous of power, and a despot by taste. All this may perhaps be\ntrue; but the inferences which have been drawn from these truths are\nexceedingly erroneous. It has been imagined that General Jackson is bent\non establishing a dictatorship in America, on introducing a military\nspirit, and on giving a degree of influence to the central authority\nwhich cannot but be dangerous to provincial liberties. But in America\nthe time for similar undertakings, and the age for men of this kind, is\nnot yet come: if General Jackson had entertained a hope of exercising\nhis authority in this manner, he would infallibly have forfeited his\npolitical station, and compromised his life; accordingly he has not been\nso imprudent as to make any such attempt.\n\nFar from wishing to extend the federal power, the President belongs\nto the party which is desirous of limiting that power to the bare and\nprecise letter of the Constitution, and which never puts a construction\nupon that act favorable to the Government of the Union; far from\nstanding forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is\nthe agent of all the jealousies of the States; and he was placed in the\nlofty station he occupies by the passions of the people which are most\nopposed to the central Government. It is by perpetually flattering\nthese passions that he maintains his station and his popularity. General\nJackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its\npropensities, and its demands; say rather, that he anticipates and\nforestalls them.\n\nWhenever the governments of the States come into collision with that\nof the Union, the President is generally the first to question his own\nrights: he almost always outstrips the legislature; and when the extent\nof the federal power is controverted, he takes part, as it were, against\nhimself; he conceals his official interests, and extinguishes his own\nnatural inclinations. Not indeed that he is naturally weak or hostile\nto the Union; for when the majority decided against the claims of the\npartisans of nullification, he put himself at its head, asserted the\ndoctrines which the nation held distinctly and energetically, and was\nthe first to recommend forcible measures; but General Jackson appears to\nme, if I may use the American expressions, to be a Federalist by taste,\nand a Republican by calculation.\n\nGeneral Jackson stoops to gain the favor of the majority, but when he\nfeels that his popularity is secure, he overthrows all obstacles in the\npursuit of the objects which the community approves, or of those which\nit does not look upon with a jealous eye. He is supported by a power\nwith which his predecessors were unacquainted; and he tramples on his\npersonal enemies whenever they cross his path with a facility which no\nformer President ever enjoyed; he takes upon himself the responsibility\nof measures which no one before him would have ventured to attempt: he\neven treats the national representatives with disdain approaching to\ninsult; he puts his veto upon the laws of Congress, and frequently\nneglects to reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes\ntreats his master roughly. The power of General Jackson perpetually\nincreases; but that of the President declines; in his hands the Federal\nGovernment is strong, but it will pass enfeebled into the hands of his\nsuccessor.\n\nI am strangely mistaken if the Federal Government of the United States\nbe not constantly losing strength, retiring gradually from public\naffairs, and narrowing its circle of action more and more. It is\nnaturally feeble, but it now abandons even its pretensions to strength.\nOn the other hand, I thought that I remarked a more lively sense of\nindependence, and a more decided attachment to provincial government in\nthe States. The Union is to subsist, but to subsist as a shadow; it\nis to be strong in certain cases, and weak in all others; in time of\nwarfare, it is to be able to concentrate all the forces of the nation\nand all the resources of the country in its hands; and in time of\npeace its existence is to be scarcely perceptible: as if this alternate\ndebility and vigor were natural or possible.\n\nI do not foresee anything for the present which may be able to\ncheck this general impulse of public opinion; the causes in which it\noriginated do not cease to operate with the same effect. The change will\ntherefore go on, and it may be predicted that, unless some extraordinary\nevent occurs, the Government of the Union will grow weaker and weaker\nevery day.\n\nI think, however, that the period is still remote at which the federal\npower will be entirely extinguished by its inability to protect itself\nand to maintain peace in the country. The Union is sanctioned by\nthe manners and desires of the people; its results are palpable, its\nbenefits visible. When it is perceived that the weakness of the Federal\nGovernment compromises the existence of the Union, I do not doubt that a\nreaction will take place with a view to increase its strength.\n\nThe Government of the United States is, of all the federal governments\nwhich have hitherto been established, the one which is most naturally\ndestined to act. As long as it is only indirectly assailed by the\ninterpretation of its laws, and as long as its substance is not\nseriously altered, a change of opinion, an internal crisis, or a war,\nmay restore all the vigor which it requires. The point which I have\nbeen most anxious to put in a clear light is simply this: Many people,\nespecially in France, imagine that a change in opinion is going on in\nthe United States, which is favorable to a centralization of power in\nthe hands of the President and the Congress. I hold that a contrary\ntendency may distinctly be observed. So far is the Federal Government\nfrom acquiring strength, and from threatening the sovereignty of the\nStates, as it grows older, that I maintain it to be growing weaker and\nweaker, and that the sovereignty of the Union alone is in danger. Such\nare the facts which the present time discloses. The future conceals the\nfinal result of this tendency, and the events which may check, retard,\nor accelerate the changes I have described; but I do not affect to be\nable to remove the veil which hides them from our sight.\n\nOf The Republican Institutions Of The United States, And What Their\nChances Of Duration Are\n\nThe Union is accidental--The Republican institutions have more prospect\nof permanence--A republic for the present the natural state of the\nAnglo-Americans--Reason of this--In order to destroy it, all the laws\nmust be changed at the same time, and a great alteration take place\nin manners--Difficulties experienced by the Americans in creating an\naristocracy.\n\nThe dismemberment of the Union, by the introduction of war into the\nheart of those States which are now confederate, with standing armies,\na dictatorship, and a heavy taxation, might, eventually, compromise the\nfate of the republican institutions. But we ought not to confound the\nfuture prospects of the republic with those of the Union. The Union is\nan accident, which will only last as long as circumstances are favorable\nto its existence; but a republican form of government seems to me to\nbe the natural state of the Americans; which nothing but the continued\naction of hostile causes, always acting in the same direction, could\nchange into a monarchy. The Union exists principally in the law which\nformed it; one revolution, one change in public opinion, might destroy\nit forever; but the republic has a much deeper foundation to rest upon.\n\n\nWhat is understood by a republican government in the United States is\nthe slow and quiet action of society upon itself. It is a regular state\nof things really founded upon the enlightened will of the people. It is\na conciliatory government under which resolutions are allowed time to\nripen; and in which they are deliberately discussed, and executed with\nmature judgment. The republicans in the United States set a high value\nupon morality, respect religious belief, and acknowledge the\nexistence of rights. They profess to think that a people ought to be\nmoral, religious, and temperate, in proportion as it is free. What is\ncalled the republic in the United States, is the tranquil rule of the\nmajority, which, after having had time to examine itself, and to give\nproof of its existence, is the common source of all the powers of the\nState. But the power of the majority is not of itself unlimited. In the\nmoral world humanity, justice, and reason enjoy an undisputed supremacy;\nin the political world vested rights are treated with no less deference.\nThe majority recognizes these two barriers; and if it now and then\noverstep them, it is because, like individuals, it has passions, and,\nlike them, it is prone to do what is wrong, whilst it discerns what is\nright.\n\nBut the demagogues of Europe have made strange discoveries. A republic\nis not, according to them, the rule of the majority, as has hitherto\nbeen thought, but the rule of those who are strenuous partisans of\nthe majority. It is not the people who preponderates in this kind of\ngovernment, but those who are best versed in the good qualities of the\npeople. A happy distinction, which allows men to act in the name of\nnations without consulting them, and to claim their gratitude whilst\ntheir rights are spurned. A republican government, moreover, is the only\none which claims the right of doing whatever it chooses, and despising\nwhat men have hitherto respected, from the highest moral obligations to\nthe vulgar rules of common-sense. It had been supposed, until our time,\nthat despotism was odious, under whatever form it appeared. But it is\na discovery of modern days that there are such things as legitimate\ntyranny and holy injustice, provided they are exercised in the name of\nthe people.\n\nThe ideas which the Americans have adopted respecting the republican\nform of government, render it easy for them to live under it, and insure\nits duration. If, in their country, this form be often practically bad,\nat least it is theoretically good; and, in the end, the people always\nacts in conformity to it.\n\nIt was impossible at the foundation of the States, and it would still\nbe difficult, to establish a central administration in America. The\ninhabitants are dispersed over too great a space, and separated by too\nmany natural obstacles, for one man to undertake to direct the details\nof their existence. America is therefore pre-eminently the country of\nprovincial and municipal government. To this cause, which was plainly\nfelt by all the Europeans of the New World, the Anglo-Americans added\nseveral others peculiar to themselves.\n\nAt the time of the settlement of the North American colonies, municipal\nliberty had already penetrated into the laws as well as the manners\nof the English; and the emigrants adopted it, not only as a necessary\nthing, but as a benefit which they knew how to appreciate. We have\nalready seen the manner in which the colonies were founded: every\nprovince, and almost every district, was peopled separately by men who\nwere strangers to each other, or who associated with very different\npurposes. The English settlers in the United States, therefore, early\nperceived that they were divided into a great number of small and\ndistinct communities which belonged to no common centre; and that it\nwas needful for each of these little communities to take care of its own\naffairs, since there did not appear to be any central authority which\nwas naturally bound and easily enabled to provide for them. Thus, the\nnature of the country, the manner in which the British colonies were\nfounded, the habits of the first emigrants, in short everything,\nunited to promote, in an extraordinary degree, municipal and provincial\nliberties.\n\nIn the United States, therefore, the mass of the institutions of the\ncountry is essentially republican; and in order permanently to destroy\nthe laws which form the basis of the republic, it would be necessary to\nabolish all the laws at once. At the present day it would be even more\ndifficult for a party to succeed in founding a monarchy in the United\nStates than for a set of men to proclaim that France should henceforward\nbe a republic. Royalty would not find a system of legislation prepared\nfor it beforehand; and a monarchy would then exist, really surrounded by\nrepublican institutions. The monarchical principle would likewise have\ngreat difficulty in penetrating into the manners of the Americans.\n\nIn the United States, the sovereignty of the people is not an isolated\ndoctrine bearing no relation to the prevailing manners and ideas of the\npeople: it may, on the contrary, be regarded as the last link of a chain\nof opinions which binds the whole Anglo-American world. That Providence\nhas given to every human being the degree of reason necessary to direct\nhimself in the affairs which interest him exclusively--such is the grand\nmaxim upon which civil and political society rests in the United States.\nThe father of a family applies it to his children; the master to his\nservants; the township to its officers; the province to its townships;\nthe State to its provinces; the Union to the States; and when extended\nto the nation, it becomes the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people.\n\nThus, in the United States, the fundamental principle of the republic\nis the same which governs the greater part of human actions; republican\nnotions insinuate themselves into all the ideas, opinions, and habits of\nthe Americans, whilst they are formerly recognized by the legislation:\nand before this legislation can be altered the whole community must\nundergo very serious changes. In the United States, even the religion of\nmost of the citizens is republican, since it submits the truths of the\nother world to private judgment: as in politics the care of its temporal\ninterests is abandoned to the good sense of the people. Thus every man\nis allowed freely to take that road which he thinks will lead him to\nheaven; just as the law permits every citizen to have the right of\nchoosing his government.\n\nIt is evident that nothing but a long series of events, all having the\nsame tendency, can substitute for this combination of laws, opinions,\nand manners, a mass of opposite opinions, manners, and laws.\n\nIf republican principles are to perish in America, they can only yield\nafter a laborious social process, often interrupted, and as often\nresumed; they will have many apparent revivals, and will not become\ntotally extinct until an entirely new people shall have succeeded to\nthat which now exists. Now, it must be admitted that there is no symptom\nor presage of the approach of such a revolution. There is nothing more\nstriking to a person newly arrived in the United States, than the kind\nof tumultuous agitation in which he finds political society. The laws\nare incessantly changing, and at first sight it seems impossible that a\npeople so variable in its desires should avoid adopting, within a short\nspace of time, a completely new form of government. Such apprehensions\nare, however, premature; the instability which affects political\ninstitutions is of two kinds, which ought not to be confounded: the\nfirst, which modifies secondary laws, is not incompatible with a very\nsettled state of society; the other shakes the very foundations of the\nConstitution, and attacks the fundamental principles of legislation;\nthis species of instability is always followed by troubles and\nrevolutions, and the nation which suffers under it is in a state of\nviolent transition.\n\nExperience shows that these two kinds of legislative instability have\nno necessary connection; for they have been found united or separate,\naccording to times and circumstances. The first is common in the United\nStates, but not the second: the Americans often change their laws, but\nthe foundation of the Constitution is respected.\n\nIn our days the republican principle rules in America, as the\nmonarchical principle did in France under Louis XIV. The French of\nthat period were not only friends of the monarchy, but they thought it\nimpossible to put anything in its place; they received it as we receive\nthe rays of the sun and the return of the seasons. Amongst them the\nroyal power had neither advocates nor opponents. In like manner does\nthe republican government exist in America, without contention or\nopposition; without proofs and arguments, by a tacit agreement, a sort\nof consensus universalis. It is, however, my opinion that by changing\ntheir administrative forms as often as they do, the inhabitants of the\nUnited States compromise the future stability of their government.\n\nIt may be apprehended that men, perpetually thwarted in their designs\nby the mutability of the legislation, will learn to look upon republican\ninstitutions as an inconvenient form of society; the evil resulting from\nthe instability of the secondary enactments might then raise a doubt\nas to the nature of the fundamental principles of the Constitution,\nand indirectly bring about a revolution; but this epoch is still very\nremote.\n\nIt may, however, be foreseen even now, that when the Americans lose\ntheir republican institutions they will speedily arrive at a despotic\ngovernment, without a long interval of limited monarchy. Montesquieu\nremarked, that nothing is more absolute than the authority of a\nprince who immediately succeeds a republic, since the powers which had\nfearlessly been intrusted to an elected magistrate are then transferred\nto a hereditary sovereign. This is true in general, but it is more\npeculiarly applicable to a democratic republic. In the United States,\nthe magistrates are not elected by a particular class of citizens, but\nby the majority of the nation; they are the immediate representatives of\nthe passions of the multitude; and as they are wholly dependent upon its\npleasure, they excite neither hatred nor fear: hence, as I have already\nshown, very little care has been taken to limit their influence, and\nthey are left in possession of a vast deal of arbitrary power. This\nstate of things has engendered habits which would outlive itself; the\nAmerican magistrate would retain his power, but he would cease to be\nresponsible for the exercise of it; and it is impossible to say what\nbounds could then be set to tyranny.\n\nSome of our European politicians expect to see an aristocracy arise in\nAmerica, and they already predict the exact period at which it will be\nable to assume the reins of government. I have previously observed, and\nI repeat my assertion, that the present tendency of American society\nappears to me to become more and more democratic. Nevertheless, I do not\nassert that the Americans will not, at some future time, restrict the\ncircle of political rights in their country, or confiscate those rights\nto the advantage of a single individual; but I cannot imagine that they\nwill ever bestow the exclusive exercise of them upon a privileged\nclass of citizens, or, in other words, that they will ever found an\naristocracy.\n\nAn aristocratic body is composed of a certain number of citizens\nwho, without being very far removed from the mass of the people, are,\nnevertheless, permanently stationed above it: a body which it is easy\nto touch and difficult to strike; with which the people are in daily\ncontact, but with which they can never combine. Nothing can be imagined\nmore contrary to nature and to the secret propensities of the human\nheart than a subjection of this kind; and men who are left to follow\ntheir own bent will always prefer the arbitrary power of a king to the\nregular administration of an aristocracy. Aristocratic institutions\ncannot subsist without laying down the inequality of men as a\nfundamental principle, as a part and parcel of the legislation,\naffecting the condition of the human family as much as it affects that\nof society; but these are things so repugnant to natural equity that\nthey can only be extorted from men by constraint.\n\nI do not think a single people can be quoted, since human society began\nto exist, which has, by its own free will and by its own exertions,\ncreated an aristocracy within its own bosom. All the aristocracies of\nthe Middle Ages were founded by military conquest; the conqueror was the\nnoble, the vanquished became the serf. Inequality was then imposed by\nforce; and after it had been introduced into the manners of the country\nit maintained its own authority, and was sanctioned by the legislation.\nCommunities have existed which were aristocratic from their earliest\norigin, owing to circumstances anterior to that event, and which became\nmore democratic in each succeeding age. Such was the destiny of the\nRomans, and of the barbarians after them. But a people, having taken its\nrise in civilization and democracy, which should gradually establish an\ninequality of conditions, until it arrived at inviolable privileges and\nexclusive castes, would be a novelty in the world; and nothing intimates\nthat America is likely to furnish so singular an example.\n\nReflection On The Causes Of The Commercial Prosperity Of The Of The\nUnited States\n\nThe Americans destined by Nature to be a great maritime people--Extent\nof their coasts--Depth of their ports--Size of their rivers--The\ncommercial superiority of the Anglo-Americans less attributable,\nhowever, to physical circumstances than to moral and intellectual\ncauses--Reason of this opinion--Future destiny of the Anglo-Americans\nas a commercial nation--The dissolution of the Union would not check\nthe maritime vigor of the States--Reason of this--Anglo-Americans will\nnaturally supply the wants of the inhabitants of South America--They\nwill become, like the English, the factors of a great portion of the\nworld.\n\nThe coast of the United States, from the Bay of Fundy to the Sabine\nRiver in the Gulf of Mexico, is more than two thousand miles in extent.\nThese shores form an unbroken line, and they are all subject to the same\ngovernment. No nation in the world possesses vaster, deeper, or more\nsecure ports for shipping than the Americans.\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States constitute a great civilized\npeople, which fortune has placed in the midst of an uncultivated\ncountry at a distance of three thousand miles from the central point\nof civilization. America consequently stands in daily need of European\ntrade. The Americans will, no doubt, ultimately succeed in producing or\nmanufacturing at home most of the articles which they require; but the\ntwo continents can never be independent of each other, so numerous are\nthe natural ties which exist between their wants, their ideas, their\nhabits, and their manners.\n\nThe Union produces peculiar commodities which are now become necessary\nto us, but which cannot be cultivated, or can only be raised at an\nenormous expense, upon the soil of Europe. The Americans only consume a\nsmall portion of this produce, and they are willing to sell us the rest.\nEurope is therefore the market of America, as America is the market\nof Europe; and maritime commerce is no less necessary to enable the\ninhabitants of the United States to transport their raw materials to\nthe ports of Europe, than it is to enable us to supply them with our\nmanufactured produce. The United States were therefore necessarily\nreduced to the alternative of increasing the business of other maritime\nnations to a great extent, if they had themselves declined to enter\ninto commerce, as the Spaniards of Mexico have hitherto done; or, in the\nsecond place, of becoming one of the first trading powers of the globe.\n\nThe Anglo-Americans have always displayed a very decided taste for the\nsea. The Declaration of Independence broke the commercial restrictions\nwhich united them to England, and gave a fresh and powerful stimulus to\ntheir maritime genius. Ever since that time, the shipping of the Union\nhas increased in almost the same rapid proportion as the number of its\ninhabitants. The Americans themselves now transport to their own shores\nnine-tenths of the European produce which they consume. *g And they also\nbring three-quarters of the exports of the New World to the European\nconsumer. *h The ships of the United States fill the docks of Havre and\nof Liverpool; whilst the number of English and French vessels which are\nto be seen at New York is comparatively small. *i\n\n[Footnote g: The total value of goods imported during the year which\nended on September 30, 1832, was $101,129,266. The value of the cargoes\nof foreign vessels did not amount to $10,731,039, or about one-tenth of\nthe entire sum.]\n\n[Footnote h: The value of goods exported during the same year amounted\nto $87,176,943; the value of goods exported by foreign vessels amounted\nto $21,036,183, or about one quarter of the whole sum. (Williams's\n\"Register,\" 1833, p. 398.)]\n\n[Footnote i: The tonnage of the vessels which entered all the ports of\nthe Union in the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, amounted to 3,307,719 tons,\nof which 544,571 tons were foreign vessels; they stood, therefore,\nto the American vessels in a ratio of about 16 to 100. (\"National\nCalendar,\" 1833, p. 304.) The tonnage of the English vessels which\nentered the ports of London, Liverpool, and Hull, in the years 1820,\n1826, and 1831, amounted to 443,800 tons. The foreign vessels which\nentered the same ports during the same years amounted to 159,431 tons.\nThe ratio between them was, therefore, about 36 to 100. (\"Companion\nto the Almanac,\" 1834, p. 169.) In the year 1832 the ratio between the\nforeign and British ships which entered the ports of Great Britain was\n29 to 100. [These statements relate to a condition of affairs which\nhas ceased to exist; the Civil War and the heavy taxation of the United\nStates entirely altered the trade and navigation of the country.]]\n\nThus, not only does the American merchant face the competition of his\nown countrymen, but he even supports that of foreign nations in their\nown ports with success. This is readily explained by the fact that the\nvessels of the United States can cross the seas at a cheaper rate than\nany other vessels in the world. As long as the mercantile shipping of\nthe United States preserves this superiority, it will not only retain\nwhat it has acquired, but it will constantly increase in prosperity.\n\n\n\n\nChapter XVIII: Future Condition Of Three Races--Part X\n\nIt is difficult to say for what reason the Americans can trade at a\nlower rate than other nations; and one is at first led to attribute\nthis circumstance to the physical or natural advantages which are within\ntheir reach; but this supposition is erroneous. The American vessels\ncost almost as much to build as our own; *j they are not better built,\nand they generally last for a shorter time. The pay of the American\nsailor is more considerable than the pay on board European ships; which\nis proved by the great number of Europeans who are to be met with in the\nmerchant vessels of the United States. But I am of opinion that the\ntrue cause of their superiority must not be sought for in physical\nadvantages, but that it is wholly attributable to their moral and\nintellectual qualities.\n\n[Footnote j: Materials are, generally speaking, less expensive in\nAmerica than in Europe, but the price of labor is much higher.]\n\nThe following comparison will illustrate my meaning. During the\ncampaigns of the Revolution the French introduced a new system of\ntactics into the art of war, which perplexed the oldest generals,\nand very nearly destroyed the most ancient monarchies in Europe. They\nundertook (what had never before been attempted) to make shift without\na number of things which had always been held to be indispensable in\nwarfare; they required novel exertions on the part of their troops which\nno civilized nations had ever thought of; they achieved great actions\nin an incredibly short space of time; and they risked human life without\nhesitation to obtain the object in view. The French had less money and\nfewer men than their enemies; their resources were infinitely inferior;\nnevertheless they were constantly victorious, until their adversaries\nchose to imitate their example.\n\nThe Americans have introduced a similar system into their commercial\nspeculations; and they do for cheapness what the French did for\nconquest. The European sailor navigates with prudence; he only sets sail\nwhen the weather is favorable; if an unforseen accident befalls him, he\nputs into port; at night he furls a portion of his canvas; and when the\nwhitening billows intimate the vicinity of land, he checks his way,\nand takes an observation of the sun. But the American neglects these\nprecautions and braves these dangers. He weighs anchor in the midst\nof tempestuous gales; by night and by day he spreads his sheets to the\nwind; he repairs as he goes along such damage as his vessel may have\nsustained from the storm; and when he at last approaches the term of his\nvoyage, he darts onward to the shore as if he already descried a port.\nThe Americans are often shipwrecked, but no trader crosses the seas so\nrapidly. And as they perform the same distance in a shorter time, they\ncan perform it at a cheaper rate.\n\nThe European touches several times at different ports in the course of a\nlong voyage; he loses a good deal of precious time in making the harbor,\nor in waiting for a favorable wind to leave it; and he pays daily dues\nto be allowed to remain there. The American starts from Boston to go to\npurchase tea in China; he arrives at Canton, stays there a few days, and\nthen returns. In less than two years he has sailed as far as the entire\ncircumference of the globe, and he has seen land but once. It is true\nthat during a voyage of eight or ten months he has drunk brackish water\nand lived upon salt meat; that he has been in a continual contest with\nthe sea, with disease, and with a tedious existence; but upon his return\nhe can sell a pound of his tea for a half-penny less than the English\nmerchant, and his purpose is accomplished.\n\nI cannot better explain my meaning than by saying that the Americans\naffect a sort of heroism in their manner of trading. But the European\nmerchant will always find it very difficult to imitate his American\ncompetitor, who, in adopting the system which I have just described,\nfollows not only a calculation of his gain, but an impulse of his\nnature.\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States are subject to all the wants and\nall the desires which result from an advanced stage of civilization; but\nas they are not surrounded by a community admirably adapted, like that\nof Europe, to satisfy their wants, they are often obliged to procure for\nthemselves the various articles which education and habit have rendered\nnecessaries. In America it sometimes happens that the same individual\ntills his field, builds his dwelling, contrives his tools, makes his\nshoes, and weaves the coarse stuff of which his dress is composed.\nThis circumstance is prejudicial to the excellence of the work; but\nit powerfully contributes to awaken the intelligence of the workman.\nNothing tends to materialize man, and to deprive his work of the\nfaintest trace of mind, more than extreme division of labor. In a\ncountry like America, where men devoted to special occupations are rare,\na long apprenticeship cannot be required from anyone who embraces a\nprofession. The Americans, therefore, change their means of gaining\na livelihood very readily; and they suit their occupations to the\nexigencies of the moment, in the manner most profitable to themselves.\nMen are to be met with who have successively been barristers, farmers,\nmerchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians. If the American be\nless perfect in each craft than the European, at least there is scarcely\nany trade with which he is utterly unacquainted. His capacity is more\ngeneral, and the circle of his intelligence is enlarged.\n\nThe inhabitants of the United States are never fettered by the axioms of\ntheir profession; they escape from all the prejudices of their present\nstation; they are not more attached to one line of operation than to\nanother; they are not more prone to employ an old method than a new\none; they have no rooted habits, and they easily shake off the influence\nwhich the habits of other nations might exercise upon their minds from\na conviction that their country is unlike any other, and that its\nsituation is without a precedent in the world. America is a land of\nwonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement\nseems an improvement. The idea of novelty is there indissolubly\nconnected with the idea of amelioration. No natural boundary seems to be\nset to the efforts of man; and what is not yet done is only what he has\nnot yet attempted to do.\n\nThis perpetual change which goes on in the United States, these frequent\nvicissitudes of fortune, accompanied by such unforeseen fluctuations in\nprivate and in public wealth, serve to keep the minds of the citizens\nin a perpetual state of feverish agitation, which admirably invigorates\ntheir exertions, and keeps them in a state of excitement above the\nordinary level of mankind. The whole life of an American is passed\nlike a game of chance, a revolutionary crisis, or a battle. As the\nsame causes are continually in operation throughout the country, they\nultimately impart an irresistible impulse to the national character. The\nAmerican, taken as a chance specimen of his countrymen, must then be a\nman of singular warmth in his desires, enterprising, fond of adventure,\nand, above all, of innovation. The same bent is manifest in all that he\ndoes; he introduces it into his political laws, his religious doctrines,\nhis theories of social economy, and his domestic occupations; he bears\nit with him in the depths of the backwoods, as well as in the business\nof the city. It is this same passion, applied to maritime commerce,\nwhich makes him the cheapest and the quickest trader in the world.\n\nAs long as the sailors of the United States retain these inspiriting\nadvantages, and the practical superiority which they derive from them,\nthey will not only continue to supply the wants of the producers and\nconsumers of their own country, but they will tend more and more to\nbecome, like the English, the factors of all other peoples. *k This\nprediction has already begun to be realized; we perceive that the\nAmerican traders are introducing themselves as intermediate agents in\nthe commerce of several European nations; *l and America will offer a\nstill wider field to their enterprise.\n\n[Footnote k: It must not be supposed that English vessels are\nexclusively employed in transporting foreign produce into England, or\nBritish produce to foreign countries; at the present day the merchant\nshipping of England may be regarded in the light of a vast system of\npublic conveyances, ready to serve all the producers of the world, and\nto open communications between all peoples. The maritime genius of the\nAmericans prompts them to enter into competition with the English.]\n\n[Footnote l: Part of the commerce of the Mediterranean is already\ncarried on by American vessels.]\n\nThe great colonies which were founded in South America by the Spaniards\nand the Portuguese have since become empires. Civil war and oppression\nnow lay waste those extensive regions. Population does not increase, and\nthe thinly scattered inhabitants are too much absorbed in the cares of\nself-defense even to attempt any amelioration of their condition. Such,\nhowever, will not always be the case. Europe has succeeded by her own\nefforts in piercing the gloom of the Middle Ages; South America has the\nsame Christian laws and Christian manners as we have; she contains all\nthe germs of civilization which have grown amidst the nations of\nEurope or their offsets, added to the advantages to be derived from our\nexample: why then should she always remain uncivilized? It is clear that\nthe question is simply one of time; at some future period, which may be\nmore or less remote, the inhabitants of South America will constitute\nflourishing and enlightened nations.\n\nBut when the Spaniards and Portuguese of South America begin to feel\nthe wants common to all civilized nations, they will still be unable\nto satisfy those wants for themselves; as the youngest children of\ncivilization, they must perforce admit the superiority of their elder\nbrethren. They will be agriculturists long before they succeed in\nmanufactures or commerce, and they will require the mediation of\nstrangers to exchange their produce beyond seas for those articles for\nwhich a demand will begin to be felt.\n\nIt is unquestionable that the Americans of the North will one day supply\nthe wants of the Americans of the South. Nature has placed them in\ncontiguity, and has furnished the former with every means of knowing and\nappreciating those demands, of establishing a permanent connection with\nthose States, and of gradually filling their markets. The merchants of\nthe United States could only forfeit these natural advantages if he were\nvery inferior to the merchant of Europe; to whom he is, on the contrary,\nsuperior in several respects. The Americans of the United States already\nexercise a very considerable moral influence upon all the peoples of\nthe New World. They are the source of intelligence, and all the nations\nwhich inhabit the same continent are already accustomed to consider them\nas the most enlightened, the most powerful, and the most wealthy members\nof the great American family. All eyes are therefore turned towards\nthe Union; and the States of which that body is composed are the models\nwhich the other communities try to imitate to the best of their power;\nit is from the United States that they borrow their political principles\nand their laws.\n\nThe Americans of the United States stand in precisely the same position\nwith regard to the peoples of South America as their fathers, the\nEnglish, occupy with regard to the Italians, the Spaniards, the\nPortuguese, and all those nations of Europe which receive their articles\nof daily consumption from England, because they are less advanced in\ncivilization and trade. England is at this time the natural emporium of\nalmost all the nations which are within its reach; the American Union\nwill perform the same part in the other hemisphere; and every community\nwhich is founded, or which prospers in the New World, is founded and\nprospers to the advantage of the Anglo-Americans.\n\nIf the Union were to be dissolved, the commerce of the States which now\ncompose it would undoubtedly be checked for a time; but this consequence\nwould be less perceptible than is generally supposed. It is evident\nthat, whatever may happen, the commercial States will remain united.\nThey are all contiguous to each other; they have identically the same\nopinions, interests, and manners; and they are alone competent to form a\nvery great maritime power. Even if the South of the Union were to become\nindependent of the North, it would still require the services of those\nStates. I have already observed that the South is not a commercial\ncountry, and nothing intimates that it is likely to become so. The\nAmericans of the South of the United States will therefore be obliged,\nfor a long time to come, to have recourse to strangers to export their\nproduce, and to supply them with the commodities which are requisite to\nsatisfy their wants. But the Northern States are undoubtedly able to act\nas their intermediate agents cheaper than any other merchants. They will\ntherefore retain that employment, for cheapness is the sovereign law\nof commerce. National claims and national prejudices cannot resist the\ninfluence of cheapness. Nothing can be more virulent than the hatred\nwhich exists between the Americans of the United States and the English.\nBut notwithstanding these inimical feelings, the Americans derive the\ngreater part of their manufactured commodities from England, because\nEngland supplies them at a cheaper rate than any other nation. Thus the\nincreasing prosperity of America turns, notwithstanding the grudges of\nthe Americans, to the advantage of British manufactures.\n\nReason shows and experience proves that no commercial prosperity can be\ndurable if it cannot be united, in case of need, to naval force. This\ntruth is as well understood in the United States as it can be anywhere\nelse: the Americans are already able to make their flag respected; in a\nfew years they will be able to make it feared. I am convinced that the\ndismemberment of the Union would not have the effect of diminishing the\nnaval power of the Americans, but that it would powerfully contribute\nto increase it. At the present time the commercial States are connected\nwith others which have not the same interests, and which frequently\nyield an unwilling consent to the increase of a maritime power by which\nthey are only indirectly benefited. If, on the contrary, the commercial\nStates of the Union formed one independent nation, commerce would become\nthe foremost of their national interests; they would consequently be\nwilling to make very great sacrifices to protect their shipping, and\nnothing would prevent them from pursuing their designs upon this point.\n\nNations, as well as men, almost always betray the most prominent\nfeatures of their future destiny in their earliest years. When\nI contemplate the ardor with which the Anglo-Americans prosecute\ncommercial enterprise, the advantages which befriend them, and the\nsuccess of their undertakings, I cannot refrain from believing that they\nwill one day become the first maritime power of the globe. They are born\nto rule the seas, as the Romans were to conquer the world.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have now nearly reached the close of my inquiry; hitherto, in speaking\nof the future destiny of the United States, I have endeavored to divide\nmy subject into distinct portions, in order to study each of them with\nmore attention. My present object is to embrace the whole from one\nsingle point; the remarks I shall make will be less detailed, but they\nwill be more sure. I shall perceive each object less distinctly, but I\nshall descry the principal facts with more certainty. A traveller who\nhas just left the walls of an immense city, climbs the neighboring hill;\nas he goes father off he loses sight of the men whom he has so recently\nquitted; their dwellings are confused in a dense mass; he can no longer\ndistinguish the public squares, and he can scarcely trace out the\ngreat thoroughfares; but his eye has less difficulty in following the\nboundaries of the city, and for the first time he sees the shape of\nthe vast whole. Such is the future destiny of the British race in North\nAmerica to my eye; the details of the stupendous picture are overhung\nwith shade, but I conceive a clear idea of the entire subject.\n\nThe territory now occupied or possessed by the United States of America\nforms about one-twentieth part of the habitable earth. But extensive as\nthese confines are, it must not be supposed that the Anglo-American race\nwill always remain within them; indeed, it has already far overstepped\nthem.\n\nThere was once a time at which we also might have created a great French\nnation in the American wilds, to counterbalance the influence of the\nEnglish upon the destinies of the New World. France formerly possessed\na territory in North America, scarcely less extensive than the whole of\nEurope. The three greatest rivers of that continent then flowed within\nher dominions. The Indian tribes which dwelt between the mouth of the\nSt. Lawrence and the delta of the Mississippi were unaccustomed to any\nother tongue but ours; and all the European settlements scattered over\nthat immense region recalled the traditions of our country. Louisbourg,\nMontmorency, Duquesne, St. Louis, Vincennes, New Orleans (for such were\nthe names they bore) are words dear to France and familiar to our ears.\n\nBut a concourse of circumstances, which it would be tedious to\nenumerate, *m have deprived us of this magnificent inheritance. Wherever\nthe French settlers were numerically weak and partially established,\nthey have disappeared: those who remain are collected on a small extent\nof country, and are now subject to other laws. The 400,000 French\ninhabitants of Lower Canada constitute, at the present time, the remnant\nof an old nation lost in the midst of a new people. A foreign population\nis increasing around them unceasingly and on all sides, which already\npenetrates amongst the ancient masters of the country, predominates in\ntheir cities and corrupts their language. This population is identical\nwith that of the United States; it is therefore with truth that I\nasserted that the British race is not confined within the frontiers of\nthe Union, since it already extends to the northeast.\n\n[Footnote m: The foremost of these circumstances is, that nations which\nare accustomed to free institutions and municipal government are better\nable than any others to found prosperous colonies. The habit of thinking\nand governing for oneself is indispensable in a new country, where\nsuccess necessarily depends, in a great measure, upon the individual\nexertions of the settlers.]\n\nTo the northwest nothing is to be met with but a few insignificant\nRussian settlements; but to the southwest, Mexico presents a barrier to\nthe Anglo-Americans. Thus, the Spaniards and the Anglo-Americans are,\nproperly speaking, the only two races which divide the possession of the\nNew World. The limits of separation between them have been settled by\na treaty; but although the conditions of that treaty are exceedingly\nfavorable to the Anglo-Americans, I do not doubt that they will\nshortly infringe this arrangement. Vast provinces, extending beyond\nthe frontiers of the Union towards Mexico, are still destitute of\ninhabitants. The natives of the United States will forestall the\nrightful occupants of these solitary regions. They will take possession\nof the soil, and establish social institutions, so that when the legal\nowner arrives at length, he will find the wilderness under cultivation,\nand strangers quietly settled in the midst of his inheritance. *n\n\n[Footnote n: [This was speedily accomplished, and ere long both Texas\nand California formed part of the United States. The Russian settlements\nwere acquired by purchase.]]\n\nThe lands of the New World belong to the first occupant, and they are\nthe natural reward of the swiftest pioneer. Even the countries which are\nalready peopled will have some difficulty in securing themselves from\nthis invasion. I have already alluded to what is taking place in the\nprovince of Texas. The inhabitants of the United States are perpetually\nmigrating to Texas, where they purchase land; and although they conform\nto the laws of the country, they are gradually founding the empire of\ntheir own language and their own manners. The province of Texas is still\npart of the Mexican dominions, but it will soon contain no Mexicans;\nthe same thing has occurred whenever the Anglo-Americans have come into\ncontact with populations of a different origin.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the British race has acquired an amazing\npreponderance over all the other European races in the New World; and\nthat it is very superior to them in civilization, in industry, and in\npower. As long as it is only surrounded by desert or thinly peopled\ncountries, as long as it encounters no dense populations upon its route,\nthrough which it cannot work its way, it will assuredly continue to\nspread. The lines marked out by treaties will not stop it; but it will\neverywhere transgress these imaginary barriers.\n\nThe geographical position of the British race in the New World is\npeculiarly favorable to its rapid increase. Above its northern frontiers\nthe icy regions of the Pole extend; and a few degrees below its southern\nconfines lies the burning climate of the Equator. The Anglo-Americans\nare, therefore, placed in the most temperate and habitable zone of the\ncontinent.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the prodigious increase of population in\nthe United States is posterior to their Declaration of Independence. But\nthis is an error: the population increased as rapidly under the colonial\nsystem as it does at the present day; that is to say, it doubled in\nabout twenty-two years. But this proportion which is now applied to\nmillions, was then applied to thousands of inhabitants; and the same\nfact which was scarcely noticeable a century ago, is now evident to\nevery observer.\n\nThe British subjects in Canada, who are dependent on a king, augment and\nspread almost as rapidly as the British settlers of the United States,\nwho live under a republican government. During the war of independence,\nwhich lasted eight years, the population continued to increase without\nintermission in the same ratio. Although powerful Indian nations allied\nwith the English existed at that time upon the western frontiers, the\nemigration westward was never checked. Whilst the enemy laid waste the\nshores of the Atlantic, Kentucky, the western parts of Pennsylvania, and\nthe States of Vermont and of Maine were filling with inhabitants. Nor\ndid the unsettled state of the Constitution, which succeeded the war,\nprevent the increase of the population, or stop its progress across the\nwilds. Thus, the difference of laws, the various conditions of peace and\nwar, of order and of anarchy, have exercised no perceptible influence\nupon the gradual development of the Anglo-Americans. This may be readily\nunderstood; for the fact is, that no causes are sufficiently general\nto exercise a simultaneous influence over the whole of so extensive a\nterritory. One portion of the country always offers a sure retreat from\nthe calamities which afflict another part; and however great may be the\nevil, the remedy which is at hand is greater still.\n\nIt must not, then, be imagined that the impulse of the British race in\nthe New World can be arrested. The dismemberment of the Union, and\nthe hostilities which might ensure, the abolition of republican\ninstitutions, and the tyrannical government which might succeed it,\nmay retard this impulse, but they cannot prevent it from ultimately\nfulfilling the destinies to which that race is reserved. No power upon\nearth can close upon the emigrants that fertile wilderness which offers\nresources to all industry, and a refuge from all want. Future events,\nof whatever nature they may be, will not deprive the Americans of their\nclimate or of their inland seas, of their great rivers or of their\nexuberant soil. Nor will bad laws, revolutions, and anarchy be able to\nobliterate that love of prosperity and that spirit of enterprise\nwhich seem to be the distinctive characteristics of their race, or to\nextinguish that knowledge which guides them on their way.\n\nThus, in the midst of the uncertain future, one event at least is sure.\nAt a period which may be said to be near (for we are speaking of the\nlife of a nation), the Anglo-Americans will alone cover the immense\nspace contained between the polar regions and the tropics, extending\nfrom the coasts of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. The\nterritory which will probably be occupied by the Anglo-Americans at\nsome future time, may be computed to equal three-quarters of Europe in\nextent. *o The climate of the Union is upon the whole preferable to\nthat of Europe, and its natural advantages are not less great; it\nis therefore evident that its population will at some future time be\nproportionate to our own. Europe, divided as it is between so many\ndifferent nations, and torn as it has been by incessant wars and the\nbarbarous manners of the Middle Ages, has notwithstanding attained a\npopulation of 410 inhabitants to the square league. *p What cause can\nprevent the United States from having as numerous a population in time?\n\n[Footnote o: The United States already extend over a territory equal to\none-half of Europe. The area of Europe is 500,000 square leagues, and\nits population 205,000,000 of inhabitants. (\"Malte Brun,\" liv. 114. vol.\nvi. p. 4.)\n\n[This computation is given in French leagues, which were in use when the\nauthor wrote. Twenty years later, in 1850, the superficial area of the\nUnited States had been extended to 3,306,865 square miles of territory,\nwhich is about the area of Europe.]]\n\n[Footnote p: See \"Malte Brun,\" liv. 116, vol. vi. p. 92.]\n\nMany ages must elapse before the divers offsets of the British race in\nAmerica cease to present the same homogeneous characteristics: and the\ntime cannot be foreseen at which a permanent inequality of conditions\nwill be established in the New World. Whatever differences may arise,\nfrom peace or from war, from freedom or oppression, from prosperity or\nwant, between the destinies of the different descendants of the great\nAnglo-American family, they will at least preserve an analogous social\ncondition, and they will hold in common the customs and the opinions to\nwhich that social condition has given birth.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the tie of religion was sufficiently powerful\nto imbue all the different populations of Europe with the same\ncivilization. The British of the New World have a thousand other\nreciprocal ties; and they live at a time when the tendency to equality\nis general amongst mankind. The Middle Ages were a period when\neverything was broken up; when each people, each province, each\ncity, and each family, had a strong tendency to maintain its distinct\nindividuality. At the present time an opposite tendency seems to\nprevail, and the nations seem to be advancing to unity. Our means of\nintellectual intercourse unite the most remote parts of the earth; and\nit is impossible for men to remain strangers to each other, or to be\nignorant of the events which are taking place in any corner of the\nglobe. The consequence is that there is less difference, at the present\nday, between the Europeans and their descendants in the New World, than\nthere was between certain towns in the thirteenth century which were\nonly separated by a river. If this tendency to assimilation brings\nforeign nations closer to each other, it must a fortiori prevent the\ndescendants of the same people from becoming aliens to each other.\n\nThe time will therefore come when one hundred and fifty millions of men\nwill be living in North America, *q equal in condition, the progeny of\none race, owing their origin to the same cause, and preserving the same\ncivilization, the same language, the same religion, the same habits, the\nsame manners, and imbued with the same opinions, propagated under the\nsame forms. The rest is uncertain, but this is certain; and it is a fact\nnew to the world--a fact fraught with such portentous consequences as to\nbaffle the efforts even of the imagination.\n\n[Footnote q: This would be a population proportionate to that of Europe,\ntaken at a mean rate of 410 inhabitants to the square league.]\n\nThere are, at the present time, two great nations in the world which\nseem to tend towards the same end, although they started from different\npoints: I allude to the Russians and the Americans. Both of them have\ngrown up unnoticed; and whilst the attention of mankind was directed\nelsewhere, they have suddenly assumed a most prominent place amongst the\nnations; and the world learned their existence and their greatness at\nalmost the same time.\n\nAll other nations seem to have nearly reached their natural limits, and\nonly to be charged with the maintenance of their power; but these are\nstill in the act of growth; *r all the others are stopped, or continue\nto advance with extreme difficulty; these are proceeding with ease and\nwith celerity along a path to which the human eye can assign no term.\nThe American struggles against the natural obstacles which oppose\nhim; the adversaries of the Russian are men; the former combats the\nwilderness and savage life; the latter, civilization with all its\nweapons and its arts: the conquests of the one are therefore gained by\nthe ploughshare; those of the other by the sword. The Anglo-American\nrelies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free\nscope to the unguided exertions and common-sense of the citizens;\nthe Russian centres all the authority of society in a single arm: the\nprincipal instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter servitude.\nTheir starting-point is different, and their courses are not the same;\nyet each of them seems to be marked out by the will of Heaven to sway\nthe destinies of half the globe.\n\n[Footnote r: Russia is the country in the Old World in which population\nincreases most rapidly in proportion.]", "title": "Democracy in America — Volume 1"}
